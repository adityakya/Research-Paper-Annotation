arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	The Minimum Description Length principle for online sequence estimation/prediction in a proper learning setup is studied	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	If the underlying model class is discrete, then the total expected square loss is a particularly interesting performance measure: (a) this quantity is finitely bounded, implying convergence with probability one, and (b) it additionally specifies the convergence speed	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	For MDL, in general one can only have loss bounds which are finite but exponentially larger than those for Bayes mixtures	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	We show that this is even the case if the model class contains only Bernoulli distributions	AIMX
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	We derive a new upper bound on the prediction error for countable Bernoulli classes	OWNX
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	This implies a small bound (comparable to the one for Bayes mixtures) for certain important model classes	OWNX
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	We discuss the application to Machine Learning tasks such as classification and hypothesis testing, and generalization to countable classes of iid models	OWNX
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	"``Bayes mixture"", ``Solomonoff induction"", ``marginalization"", all these terms refer to a central induction principle: Obtain a predictive distribution by integrating the product of prior and evidence over the model class"	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	In many cases however, the Bayes mixture is computationally infeasible, and even a sophisticated approximation is expensive	CONT
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	The MDL or MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimator is both a common approximation for the Bayes mixture and interesting for its own sake: Use the model with the largest product of prior and evidence	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	In practice, the MDL estimator is usually being approximated too, since only a local maximum is determined	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	How good are the predictions by Bayes mixtures and MDL	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	This question has attracted much attention	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	In many cases, an important quality measure is the  total  or cumulative  expected loss  of a predictor	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	In particular the square loss is often considered	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	Assume that the outcome space is finite, and the model class is continuously parameterized	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	Then for Bayes mixture prediction, the cumulative expected square loss is usually small but unbounded, growing with  SYMBOL , where  SYMBOL  is the sample size  CITATION	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	This corresponds to an  instantaneous  loss bound of  SYMBOL	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	For the MDL predictor, the losses behave similarly  CITATION  under appropriate conditions, in particular with a specific prior	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	Note that in order to do MDL for continuous model classes, one needs to  discretize  the parameter space, see also  CITATION	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	"On the other hand, if the model class is discrete, then Solomonoff's theorem  CITATION  bounds the cumulative expected square loss for the Bayes mixture predictions finitely, namely by  SYMBOL , where  SYMBOL  is the prior weight of the ``true"" model  SYMBOL"	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	The only necessary assumption is that the true distribution  SYMBOL  is contained in the model class, ie that we are dealing with  proper learning	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	It has been demonstrated  CITATION , that for both Bayes mixture and MDL, the proper learning assumption can be essential: If it is violated, then learning may fail very badly	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	For MDL predictions in the proper learning case, it has been shown  CITATION  that a bound of  SYMBOL  holds	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	This bound is exponentially larger than the Solomonoff bound, and it is sharp in general	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	A finite bound on the total expected square loss is particularly interesting:   It implies convergence of the predictive to the true probabilities with probability one	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	In contrast, an instantaneous loss bound of  SYMBOL  implies only convergence in probability	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	Additionally, it gives a  convergence speed , in the sense that errors of a certain magnitude cannot occur too often	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	So for both, Bayes mixtures and MDL, convergence with probability one holds, while the convergence speed is exponentially worse for MDL compared to the Bayes mixture	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	"We avoid the term ``convergence rate"" here, since the order of convergence is identical in both cases"	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	It is eg  SYMBOL  if we additionally assume that the error is monotonically decreasing, which is not necessarily true in general)	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	It is therefore natural to ask if there are model classes where the cumulative loss of MDL is comparable to that of Bayes mixture predictions	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	In the present work, we concentrate on the simplest possible stochastic case, namely discrete Bernoulli classes	AIMX
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	"Note that then the MDL ``predictor"" just becomes an estimator, in that it estimates the true parameter and directly uses that for prediction"	OWNX
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	Nevertheless, for consistency of terminology, we keep the term predictor	OWNX
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	It might be surprising to discover that in general the cumulative loss is still exponential	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	On the other hand, we will give mild conditions on the prior guaranteeing a small bound	OWNX
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	Moreover, it is well-known that the instantaneous square loss of the Maximum Likelihood estimator decays as  SYMBOL  in the Bernoulli case	MISC
arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	The same holds for MDL, as we will see	MISC

arxiv_annotate10_7_1.txt	If a string  SYMBOL  is generated by a Bernoulli distribution with computable parameter  SYMBOL , then with high probability the two-part complexity of  SYMBOL  with respect to the Bernoulli class does not exceed its algorithmic complexity by more than a constant, as shown by Vovk  CITATION	MISC

arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	The regularizer  SYMBOL  acts as a penalty on the complexity of the classifier and prevents overfitting	MISC

arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	Binary Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a prototypical example of such regularized risk minimization problems where  SYMBOL  and the loss considered is the binary hinge loss:    	MISC
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	Recently, a number of solvers have been proposed for the regularized risk minimization problem	MISC
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	The first and perhaps the best known solver is SVMStruct  CITATION , which was shown to converge in  SYMBOL  iterations to an  SYMBOL  accurate solution	MISC
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	The convergence analysis of SVMStruct was improved to  SYMBOL  iterations by  CITATION	MISC
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	In fact,  CITATION  showed that their convergence analysis holds for a more general solver than SVMStruct namely BMRM (Bundle method for regularized risk minimization)	MISC

arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	The piecewise linear lower bound is successively tightened until the gap     falls below a predefined tolerance  SYMBOL	MISC
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	Even though BMRM solves an expensive optimization problem at every iteration, the convergence analysis only uses a simple one-dimensional line search to bound the decrease in  SYMBOL	CONT
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	Furthermore, the empirical convergence behavior of BMRM is much better than the theoretically predicted rates on a number of real life problems	CONT
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	It was therefore conjectured that the rates of convergence of BMRM could be improved	MISC
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	In this paper we answer this question in the negative by explicitly constructing a regularized risk minimization problem for which BMRM takes at least  SYMBOL  iterations	AIMX
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	One possible way to circumvent the  SYMBOL  lower bound is to solve the problem in the dual	OWNX
arxiv_annotate9_279_1.txt	Using a very old result of Nesterov  CITATION  we obtain an algorithm for SVMs which only requires  SYMBOL  iterations to converge to an  SYMBOL  accurate solution; each iteration of the algorithm requires  SYMBOL  work	OWNX

jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	similar to research on risky choice, the traditional analysis of intertemporal choice takes the view that an individual behaves so as to maximize the discounted sum of all future utilities	MISC

jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	in the field of intertemporal choice, the discounted-utility du theory proposed by paul samuelson in 1937 was presented not only as a valid normative standard but also as a descriptive theory of actual intertemporal choice behavior  CITATION	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	in its general form, the du theory proposes that the value of an option, x; t, is the product of its present utility, ux, and an exponential temporal discounting function, ft, where t is the time at which x is acquired	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	the overall value of a mixed option, a = {x, t, x, t, }, denoted va, is simply the sum of these products	MISC

jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	an option a will be preferred to an option b if and only if va  greater than  vb	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	however, a large body of empirical evidence demonstrates that people systematically violate this theory	MISC

jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	this situation has led researchers to consider extensions and modifications of the du theory to reconcile it with the experimental data	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	the most prominent idea to account for these anomalies is the hyperbolic discounting model  CITATION	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	this model suggests that the discount rate is not dynamically consistent but that the rate is higher between the present and near future and lower between the near and far distant future	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	numerous theories have been developed by transforming the discount function to other forms, from one-parameter hyperbolic discounting  CITATION  to generalized hyperbolic discounting  CITATION , to proportional discounting  CITATION , and to quasi-hyperbolic discounting  CITATION	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	however, these models focus on intertemporal choice between pairs of single-dated outcomes represented as pure gains or losses	MISC

jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	with an apt transformation of the discounting rate, the additive assumption means that preferences for outcome sequences are based on a simple aggregation of their individual components within intertemporal choice  CITATION	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	the independence assumption means that the value or utility of an outcome in one period is independent of outcomes in other periods  CITATION	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	because risk and delay might be psychologically equivalent, or at least analogous, and because similar psychological processes might underlie risk and intertemporal choice  CITATION , theoretical development in intertemporal choice has progressed steadily along a similar route as that of risky choice  CITATION	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	both lines of research have spawned a large number of variant models	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	although the functional forms differ, most theories assume a maximization principle; that is, people calculate the mathematical expectation of each outcome and add them together before choosing the option that maximizes overall value or utility	MISC
jdm_annotate1_103_1.txt	a minor difference is that the existing models of intertemporal choice are relatively underdeveloped and are less flexible in dealing with empirical challenges	CONT

jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	in this paper we attempt a more direct test of the hypothesis that pro-social versus selfish behavior may represent a self-control problem	AIMX
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	we employ a standard measure of pure pro-social behavior, the one-shot dictator game, which invokes neither concerns for strategy nor for reciprocity; and a well-grounded psychometric measure of self-control, the rosenbaum self-control schedule  CITATION	OWNX
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	further, we explore the conditions under which we expect an association between self-control and pro-social behavior	OWNX
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	in so doing, we rely on two conditions necessary for successfully exercising restraint in the face of temptation; myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  propose a two-stage model of self-control, which postulates that an individual in the face of temptation first identifies conflict or not between indulging and pursuing a higher-order goal and, second, that the individual next employs self-control strategies if and only if conflict was identified at the first stage see figure 1	BASE
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	critically, self-control strategies are relevant to the decision to indulge only when the individual has identified self-control conflict	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	therefore, one strategy for investigating whether the problem of pro-social versus selfish behavior resembles one of self-control is to test whether the tendency to apply self-control strategies is positively associated with pro-social behavior when individuals have identified self-control conflict, but less so or not at all when individuals have not	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	determinants of conflict identification in the face of temptation have been explored only recently	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	in some contexts, the question is almost trivial and identification of conflict virtually obvious	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	for example, the diabetic dieter probably knows that having even a single, tempting chocolate may incur major costs	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	however, the question of self-control conflict is more ambiguous for the non-diabetic dieter, who faces the same chocolate	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	having this one chocolate alone will not incur major costs, but doing so regularly might	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	similarly, the good citizen may find that a general failure to act generously would represent a major threat to his self-image, but being stingy on just a couple of occasions is a more ambiguous matter	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  use the term epsilon cost temptation to denote tempting opportunities that incur nothing but trivial costs when consumed in small amounts, but potentially serious costs when consumed extensively	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	they argue that individuals identify self-control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation if and only if two conditions are met: a the focal consumption opportunity must be viewed in relation to multiple additional opportunities, and b the decision maker must assume that similar choices are made for each opportunity  CITATION	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	that is, considering the question of whether or not to have a delicious creamy cake will evoke self-control conflict in the dieter if the dining opportunity is viewed in relation to future opportunities for dessert consumption, but not if the dining opportunity is viewed in isolation, as a singular episode	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	similarly, the question of whether or not to be generous-to donate to a charitable organization-may elicit self-control conflict if the decision is viewed in relation to future decisions, but not if the decision is viewed in isolation	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	if viewed in relation to future decisions, the question of how much to donate on a single occasion may have bearing on the decision maker's self-image; donating now-and in the future-indicates a generous character, whereas keeping the money for oneself does not	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	however, if viewed in isolation, the question of how much to donate has little bearing on self-image; the present decision of how much to donate is considered only in light of immediate consequences, leaving self-image out of the equation	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	because a consistent self-image represents an important motivator for pro-social behavior  CITATION , we expect that individuals are more likely to identify self-control conflict between selfish and pro-social behavior if the allocation decision is seen in relation to future opportunities than if it is seen in isolation	OWNX
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  show that subtle framing manipulations are sufficient to influence identification of self-control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	they find that presenting a calendar displaying the current month, with a grid separating the dates, raised participants' subsequent consumption of potato chips relative to that of participants whom were presented a calendar without a grid	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	they argue that the gridded calendar activated an isolated versus interrelated frame of the choice opportunity; it made participants more likely to isolate the date in question and thus less likely to see the decision task in relation to similar future opportunities	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	consequently, the grid reduced the likelihood that participants would identify a conflict between the temptation to have chips and the better judgment to maintain a fine figure and good health	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	indeed, participants who viewed the gridded calendar reported experiencing less conflict during their decision to have chips or not than did those who viewed the non-gridded calendar	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	furthermore, participants' trait ability to implement self-control strategies, measured by rosenbaum's  CITATION  psychometric scale, was positively associated with chips consumption for those who viewed the calendar without the grid and who were more likely to identify conflict, but not for others who viewed the calendar with and who were less likely to identify conflict	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	that is, participants who viewed the calendar without the grid, more likely than those who viewed the calendar with, identified self-control conflict and therefore leveraged their self-control strategies to resist the tempting chips	MISC
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	to explore our hypothesis that the problem of pro-social versus selfish behavior may represent one of self-control, we have applied the empirical strategy from myrseth and fishbach  CITATION  in the dictator game-a participant is granted an endowment and asked to split it between herself and a recipient  CITATION , and in our case the red cross featured as recipient  CITATION	BASE
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	the game thus pits pro-social motivations against self-interest	OWNX
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	if pro-social versus selfish behavior could represent a self-control conflict, we would expect participants' trait self-control, as measured by rosenbaum's  CITATION  scale, to correlate positively with pro-social behavior for participants who have just previously viewed a calendar without a grid, but less so or not at all for participants who have viewed a calendar with	OWNX
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	the graph in figure 2 displays donation, as a function of level of self-control, for two different levels of identification likelihood	OWNX
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	in the case of low likelihood, the slope is expected to be weakly positive	OWNX
jdm_annotate3_120_3.txt	in the case of the higher likelihood, however, the slope is expected to be strictly greater than that in the case of low likelihood	OWNX

jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	the ph model is based on the idea that people compare one attribute at a time, such as the minimum prizes	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	in addition, the similarity model of rubinstein  CITATION  as modified by leland  CITATION  is also relevant to these studies, although these studies were not designed to test that model	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	birnbaum  CITATION  reviewed a number of critical tests that refute any rank dependent utility rdu model  CITATION  including rank and sign-dependent utility  CITATION , cpt, and expected utility eu	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	birnbaum  CITATION  noted that many of the same tests that refute cpt also contradict the priority heuristic	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	for example, the priority heuristic predicted fewer than half of the modal choices analyzed by birnbaum  CITATION , by birnbaum  CITATION , and by birnbaum and navarrete  CITATION	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	some of these choices included cases where 90% or more of the participants satisfied stochastic dominance but the priority heuristic predicts indifference	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	in other choices, significantly more than half of the participants about 70% of undergraduates violated stochastic dominance, but the priority heuristic predicts that people should satisfy it	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	"brandstatter, gigerenzer, and hertwig  CITATION  responded that properties of these choices may have induced people to use other heuristics drawn from a person's ""adaptive toolbox"""	MISC

jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	brandstatter et al CITATION  concluded that the priority heuristic does not apply when there is a stochastic dominance relation in the choice	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	in addition, brandstatter et al CITATION  argued that certain choices reviewed by birnbaum  CITATION  used gambles that differed in expected value ev	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	"brandstatter et al CITATION  presented a figure to show that the priority heuristic is not accurate when expected values evs differ, which led them to suppose that two strategies are at work, one for ""easy"" choices that differ in ev and one for ""harder"" choices where evs are nearly equal"	MISC

jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	however, birnbaum  CITATION  noted that ev ratios in birnbaum and navarrete  CITATION  had been inside the region where ph is supposed to apply; in that study, the priority heuristic failed to reproduce even half of the modal choices correctly	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	brandstatter et al CITATION  replicated part of that study and their results confirmed that the priority heuristic reproduced fewer than half of the modal choices that they chose for replication  CITATION	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	to account for the results, brandstatter et al noted that birnbaum and navarrete  CITATION  used many choices in which both gambles of a choice had the same probability distribution and in some choices two branches had the same probability	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	"ph was not accurate for such choices, so brandstatter, et al CITATION  theorized that people use a ""toting up"" heuristic for choices in which two branches had the same probability"	MISC
jdm_annotate5_228_3.txt	in some of the choices in birnbaum and navarrete  CITATION , there was a common probability-consequence branch in both choices, which was theorized to trigger editing rules and other heuristics that were called up to account for the failures of the priority heuristic	MISC

plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	A new theoretical survey of proteins' resistance to constant speed stretching is performed for a set of 17 134 proteins as described by a structure-based model.	AIMX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The proteins selected have no gaps in their structure determination and consist of no more than 250 amino acids.	MISC

plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The proteins are ranked according to the strength of the resistance.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Most of the predicted top-strength proteins have not yet been studied experimentally.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Architectures and folds which are likely to yield large forces are identified.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	New types of potent force clamps are discovered.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	They involve disulphide bridges and, in particular, cysteine slipknots.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	An effective energy parameter of the model is estimated by comparing the theoretical data on characteristic forces to the corresponding experimental values combined with an extrapolation of the theoretical data to the experimental pulling speeds.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	These studies provide guidance for future experiments on single molecule manipulation and should lead to selection of proteins for applications.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	A new class of proteins, involving cystein slipknots, is identified as one that is expected to lead to the strongest force clamps known.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	This class is characterized through molecular dynamics simulations.	MISC

plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Stretching studies of proteins CITATION are of a particular current interest and they have been performed for under a hundred of systems.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Interpretation of some of these experiments has been helped by all-atom simulations, such as reported in refs. CITATION, CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	They are limited by of order 100 ns time scales and thus require using unrealistically large constant pulling speeds.	CONT
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	However, they often elucidate the nature of the force clamp the region responsible for the largest force of resistance to pulling, FORMULA.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	All of the experimental and all-atom simulational studies address merely a tiny fraction of proteins that are stored in the Protein Data Bank CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Thus it appears worthwhile to consider a large set of proteins and determine their FORMULA within an approximate model that allows for fast and yet reasonably accurate calculations.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Structure-based models of proteins, as pioneered by Go and his collaborators CITATION and used in several implementations CITATION CITATION, seem to be suited to this task especially well since they are defined in terms of the native structures away from which stretching is imposed.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	There are many ways, all phenomenological, to construct a structure-based model of a protein.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	504 of possible variants are enumerated and 62 are studied in details in ref. CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The variants differ by the choice of effective potentials, nature of the local backbone stiffness, energy-related parameters, and of the coarse-grained degrees of freedom.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The most crucial choice relates to making a decision about which interactions between amino acids count as native contacts.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Comparing FORMULA to the corresponding experimental values in 36 available cases selects several optimal models CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Among them, there is one which is very simple and which describes a protein in terms of its FORMULA atoms, as labeled by the sequential index FORMULA.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	This model is denoted by FORMULA which stands for, respectively, the Lennard-Jones native contact potentials, local backbone stiffness represented by harmonic terms that favor the native values of local chiralities, the contact map in which there are no FORMULA contacts, and the amplitude of the Lennard-Jones potential, FORMULA, is uniform.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The contact map is determined by assigning the van der Waals spheres to the heavy atoms and by checking whether spheres belonging to different amino acids overlap in the native state CITATION, CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	If they do, a contact is declared as native.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Non-native contacts are considered repulsive.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Application of this criterion frequently selects the FORMULA contacts as native.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	If the contact map includes these contacts the resulting model will be denoted here as FORMULA.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	On average, it performs worse than FORMULA because the FORMULA contacts usually correspond to the weak van der Waals couplings as can be demonstrated in a sample of proteins by using a software CITATION which analyses atomic configurations from the chemical perspective on molecular bonds.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Thus the FORMULA couplings should better be removed from the contact map .	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The survey to determine FORMULA in 7510 model proteins with the number of amino acids, FORMULA, not exceeding 150 and 239 longer proteins has been accomplished twice.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	First within the FORMULA model CITATION and soon afterwords within the FORMULA model CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The first survey also comes with many details of the methodology whereas the second just presents the outcomes.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The two surveys are compared in more details in refs. CITATION, CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The results differ, particularly when it comes to ranking of the proteins according to the value of FORMULA, but they mutually provide the error bars on the findings.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	They both agree, however, on predicting that there are many proteins whose strength should be considerably larger than the frequently studied benchmark the sarcomere protein titin.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Near the top of the list, there is the scaffoldin protein c7A which has been recently measured to have FORMULA of about 480 pN CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Other findings include establishing correlations with the CATH hierarchical classification scheme CITATION, CITATION, such as that there are no strong FORMULA proteins, and identification of several types of the force clamps.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The large forces most commonly originate in parallel FORMULA that are sheared CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	However, there are also clamps with antiparallel FORMULA, unstructured strands, and other kinds.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The two surveys have been based on the structure download made on July 26, 2005 when the PDB comprised 29 385 entries.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Many of them correspond to nucleic acids, complexes with nucleic acids and with other proteins, carbohydrates, or come with incomplete files and hence the much smaller number of proteins that could be used in the molecular dynamics studies.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Here, we present results of still another survey which is based on a download of December 18, 2008 which contains 54 807 structure files and leads to 17 134 acceptable structures with FORMULA not exceeding 250.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	These structures are then analyzed through simulations based on the FORMULA model.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The numerical code has been improved to allow for acceleration of calculations by a factor of 2.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The 190 structures with the top values of FORMULA in units of FORMULA are shown in Table 1 and Table S1 of the SI, together with the values of titin and ubiquitin to provide a scale.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	As argued in the Materials and Methods section section, the unit of force, FORMULA, is now estimated to be of order 110 pN.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	All of the corresponding proteins are predicted to be much stronger than titin and none but two of them have been studied experimentally yet.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	In addition to the types of force clamps identified before, we have discovered two new mechanisms of sturdiness.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	One of them involves a cysteine slipknot and is found to be operational in all of the 13 top strength proteins.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	In this motif, a slip-loop is pulled out of a cysteine knot-loop.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	Another involves dragging of a single fragment of the main chain across a cysteine knot-loop.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The two mechanisms are similar in spirit since both involve dragging of the backbone.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	However, in the CSK case, two fragments of the backbone are participating.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	We make a more systematic identification of the CATH-classified architectures that are linked to mechanical strength and then analyze correlations of the data to the SCOP-based grouping CITATION CITATION.	AIMX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The previous surveys did not relate to the SCOP scheme.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	We identify the CATH-based architectures and SCOP-based folds that are associated with the occurrence of a strong resistance to pulling.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	A general observation, however, is that each such group of structures may also include examples of proteins that unravel easily.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The dynamics of a protein are very sensitive to mechanical details that are largely captured by the contact map and not just by the appearance of a structure.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	On the other hand, if one were to look for mechanically strong proteins then the architectures and folds identified by us should provide a good starting point.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	We also study the dependence of FORMULA on the pulling velocity and characterize the dependence on FORMULA through distributions of the forces.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	The current third survey has been performed within the same FORMULA model as the second survey CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_1.txt	However, we reuse and extend it here because the editors of Biophysical Journal retracted the second survey CITATION.	BASE

plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	Among them, there is one which is very simple and which describes a protein in terms of its FORMULA atoms, as labeled by the sequential index FORMULA.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	This model is denoted by FORMULA which stands for, respectively, the Lennard-Jones native contact potentials, local backbone stiffness represented by harmonic terms that favor the native values of local chiralities, the contact map in which there are no FORMULA contacts, and the amplitude of the Lennard-Jones potential, FORMULA, is uniform.

plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	The contact map is determined by assigning the van der Waals spheres to the heavy atoms and by checking whether spheres belonging to different amino acids overlap in the native state CITATION, CITATION.	MISC

plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	Application of this criterion frequently selects the FORMULA contacts as native.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	If the contact map includes these contacts the resulting model will be denoted here as FORMULA.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	On average, it performs worse than FORMULA because the FORMULA contacts usually correspond to the weak van der Waals couplings as can be demonstrated in a sample of proteins by using a software CITATION which analyses atomic configurations from the chemical perspective on molecular bonds.

plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	The large forces most commonly originate in parallel FORMULA that are sheared CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	However, there are also clamps with antiparallel FORMULA, unstructured strands, and other kinds.	MISC

plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	As argued in the Materials and Methods section section, the unit of force, FORMULA, is now estimated to be of order 110 pN.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	All of the corresponding proteins are predicted to be much stronger than titin and none but two of them have been studied experimentally yet.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	In addition to the types of force clamps identified before, we have discovered two new mechanisms of sturdiness.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	One of them involves a cysteine slipknot and is found to be operational in all of the 13 top strength proteins.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	In this motif, a slip-loop is pulled out of a cysteine knot-loop.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	Another involves dragging of a single fragment of the main chain across a cysteine knot-loop.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	The two mechanisms are similar in spirit since both involve dragging of the backbone.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	However, in the CSK case, two fragments of the backbone are participating.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	We make a more systematic identification of the CATH-classified architectures that are linked to mechanical strength and then analyze correlations of the data to the SCOP-based grouping CITATION CITATION.	AIMX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	The previous surveys did not relate to the SCOP scheme.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	We identify the CATH-based architectures and SCOP-based folds that are associated with the occurrence of a strong resistance to pulling.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	A general observation, however, is that each such group of structures may also include examples of proteins that unravel easily.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	The dynamics of a protein are very sensitive to mechanical details that are largely captured by the contact map and not just by the appearance of a structure.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	On the other hand, if one were to look for mechanically strong proteins then the architectures and folds identified by us should provide a good starting point.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	We also study the dependence of FORMULA on the pulling velocity and characterize the dependence on FORMULA through distributions of the forces.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	The current third survey has been performed within the same FORMULA model as the second survey CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_2.txt	However, we reuse and extend it here because the editors of Biophysical Journal retracted the second survey CITATION.	BASE

plos_annotate10_1140_3.txt	Architectures and folds which are likely to yield large forces are identified.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_3.txt	New types of potent force clamps are discovered.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_3.txt	They involve disulphide bridges and, in particular, cysteine slipknots.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_3.txt	An effective energy parameter of the model is estimated by comparing the theoretical data on characteristic forces to the corresponding experimental values combined with an extrapolation of the theoretical data to the experimental pulling speeds.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_3.txt	These studies provide guidance for future experiments on single molecule manipulation and should lead to selection of proteins for applications.	OWNX
plos_annotate10_1140_3.txt	A new class of proteins, involving cystein slipknots, is identified as one that is expected to lead to the strongest force clamps known.	OWNX

plos_annotate10_1140_3.txt	Interpretation of some of these experiments has been helped by all-atom simulations, such as reported in refs. CITATION, CITATION.	MISC
plos_annotate10_1140_3.txt	They are limited by of order 100 ns time scales and thus require using unrealistically large constant pulling speeds.	CONT

plos_annotate10_1140_3.txt	Structure-based models of proteins, as pioneered by Go and his collaborators CITATION and used in several implementations CITATION CITATION, seem to be suited to this task especially well since they are defined in terms of the native structures away from which stretching is imposed.
