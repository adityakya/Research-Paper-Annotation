MISC--: enormous successes been made quantum algorithms during last decade
AIMX--: this paper we combine quantum game problem data clustering then develop quantum game based clustering algorithm data points dataset considered players who make decisions implement quantum strategies quantum games
OWNX--: after each round quantum game each player s expected payoff calculated
OWNX--: later he uses link removing rewiring lrr function change his neighbors adjust strength links connecting them order maximize his payoff
OWNX--: further algorithms discussed analyzed two cases strategies two payoff matrixes two lrr functions
MISC--: consequently simulation results demonstrated data points datasets clustered reasonably efficiently clustering algorithms fast rates convergence
MISC--: moreover comparison other algorithms also provides indication effectiveness proposed approach keywords unsupervised learning data clustering quantum computation quantum game
MISC--: quantum computation extremely exciting rapidly growing field
MISC--: more recently increasing number researchers different backgrounds ranging physics computer sciences information theory mathematics philosophy involved researching properties quantum based computation citation
MISC--: during last decade series significant breakthroughs had been made
CONT--: one was peter shor surprised world proposing polynomial time quantum algorithm integer factorization citation while classical world best known classical factoring algorithm works superpolynomial time
MISC--: three years later lov grover proved quantum computer could search unsorted database square root time citation
MISC--: meanwhile gilles brassard et al combined ideas grover s shor s quantum algorithms propose quantum counting algorithm citation
MISC--: recent years many interests focus quantum game theory considerable work been done
MISC--: instance d meyer citation studied penny flip game quantum world firstly
MISC--: his result showed if player was allowed implement quantum strategies he would always defeat his opponent who played classical strategies increase his expected payoff well j eisert et al citation quantized prisoners dilemma demonstrated dilemma could escaped when both players resort quantum strategies p
MISC--: flitney et al citation generalized eisert s result miracle move i e result game would move towards quantum player s preferred result while other player used classical strategies l marinatto et al citation investigated battle sexes game quantum domain
MISC--: their result showed there existed unique equilibrium game when entangled strategies were allowed c f
MISC--: lee et al citation reported quantum game more efficient than classical game they found upper bound this efficiency
MISC--: besides some experiments about quantum games also been implemented different quantum computers citation
MISC--: more details about quantum games see citation
MISC--: successes achieved quantum algorithms make us guess powerful quantum computers figure out solutions faster better than best known classical counterparts certain types problems
MISC--: furthermore more important they offer new way find potentially dramatic algorithmic speed ups
AIMX--: therefore we may ask naturally we construct quantum versions classical algorithms present new quantum algorithms solve problems pattern recognition faster better quantum computer
MISC--: following this idea some researchers proposed their novel methods demonstrated exciting results citation
MISC--: addition data clustering main branch pattern recognition widely used many fields pattern analysis data mining information retrieval image segmentation
MISC--: fields however there usually little priori knowledge available about data
MISC--: response restrictions clustering methodology come into being particularly suitable exploration interrelationships among data points
MISC--: data clustering formal study algorithms methods grouping classifying unlabeled data points citation
MISC--: other words its task find inherent structure given collection unlabeled data points group them into meaningful clusters citation
AIMX--: this paper we attempt combine quantum game problem data clustering order establish novel clustering algorithm based quantum games
OWNX--: our algorithms unlabeled data points dataset regarded players who make decisions quantum games
MISC--: time varying network formed players each player permitted use quantum strategies plays symbol entangled quantum game against every one his neighbors respectively
MISC--: later he applies link removing rewiring lrr function remove links neighbors small payoffs create new links neighbors higher payoffs at same time
OWNX--: furthermore strength links between player his neighbors different one another updated grover iteration
MISC--: during quantum games structure network strength links between players tend toward stability gradually
MISC--: finally if each player only connects neighbor highest strength network will naturally divide into several separate parts each corresponds cluster
OWNX--: remainder this paper organized follows section introduces some important concepts about quantum computation quantum prisoners dilemma briefly
OWNX--: section algorithms established two cases strategies payoff matrices link removing rewiring lrr functions then they elaborated analyzed
OWNX--: section relationship between number nearest neighbors number clusters discussed
MISC--: next effect cost sd like payoff matrix analyzed relationship between total payoffs rates convergence algorithms explained
OWNX--: section those datasets used simulations introduced briefly then results algorithms demonstrated
OWNX--: conclusion given section
