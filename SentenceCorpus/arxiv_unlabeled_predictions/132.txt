AIMX--: games prediction expert advice considered this paper
OWNX--: we present some modification kalai vempala algorithm following perturbed leader case unrestrictedly large one step gains
AIMX--: we show general case cumulative gain any probabilistic prediction algorithm much worse than gain some expert pool
OWNX--: nevertheless we give lower bound this cumulative gain general case construct universal algorithm optimal performance we also prove case when one step gains experts pool limited deviations performance our algorithm close performance best expert
MISC--: experts algorithms used online prediction repeated decision making repeated game playing
MISC--: any algorithm based pool experts
MISC--: at any step symbol each expert gives its recommendation
MISC--: this master decision performed
MISC--: after losses rewards symbol assigned each expert symbol environment adversary
MISC--: master algorithm also receives some loss reward depending master decision
MISC--: goal master algorithm perform almost well best expert hindsight long run
AIMX--: prediction expert advice considered this paper proceeds follows
OWNX--: we asked perform sequential actions at times symbol
OWNX--: at each time step symbol we observe results actions experts form their gains losses steps symbol
OWNX--: after at beginning step symbol learner makes decision follow one experts say expert symbol
MISC--: at end step symbol learner receives same gain loss expert symbol at step symbol
BASE--: we use notations definitions citation citation
MISC--: let symbol cumulative loss expert symbol at time symbol
MISC--: given symbol symbol at time symbol natural idea solve expert problem follow leader i e select expert symbol performed best past
MISC--: following simple example kalai vempala citation shows learner perform much worse than each expert let current losses two experts steps symbol symbol symbol
MISC--: follow leader algorithm always chooses wrong prediction
OWNX--: method following perturbed leader was discovered hannan citation
OWNX--: kalai vempala citation rediscovered this method published simple proof main result hannan
MISC--: they called algorithm this type fpl following perturbed leader
MISC--: hutter poland citation presented further developments fpl algorithm countable class experts arbitrary weights adaptive learning rate
OWNX--: fpl algorithm outputs prediction expert symbol minimizes symbol symbol xi t i symbol i m symbol t symbol p t e t symbol symbol symbol symbol symbol n symbol i symbol t symbol s i t symbol t symbol b t symbol s tb t symbol t symbol s i t symbol i symbol s i t seems too restrictive
OWNX--: appendix we consider some applications results sections this paper
OWNX--: we define two financial experts learning fractional brownian motion whose one step gains at any step not restricted advance
OWNX--: this application at bottom our special interest zero sum games unbounded gains section
AIMX--: this paper we present some modification kalai vempala algorithm case unrestrictedly large one step gains not bounded advance
AIMX--: we show general case cumulative gain any probabilistic prediction algorithm much worse than gain some expert pool
OWNX--: nevertheless we give lower bound cumulative gain any probabilistic algorithm general case prove our universal algorithm optimal performance we also prove case when one step gains experts pool limited deviations particular when they bounded performance our algorithm close performance best expert
OWNX--: this result some improvement results mentioned above
