MISC--: max product belief propagation local iterative algorithm find mode map estimate probability distribution
MISC--: while been successfully employed wide variety applications there relatively few theoretical guarantees convergence correctness general loopy graphs may many short cycles
MISC--: even fewer provide exact necessary sufficient characterizations
AIMX--: this paper we investigate problem using max product find maximum weight matching arbitrary graph edge weights
MISC--: this done first constructing probability distribution whose mode corresponds optimal matching then running max product
MISC--: weighted matching also posed integer program there lp relaxation
OWNX--: this relaxation not always tight
AIMX--: this paper we show if lp relaxation tight then max product always converges too correct answer
MISC--: if lp relaxation loose then max product does not converge
OWNX--: this provides exact data dependent characterization max product performance precise connection lp relaxation well studied optimization technique
OWNX--: also since lp relaxation known tight bipartite graphs our results generalize other recent results using max product find weighted matchings bipartite graphs
MISC--: message passing algorithms like belief propagation its variants generalizations been shown empirically very effective solving many instances hard computationally intensive problems wide range fields
MISC--: algorithms were originally designed exact inference i e calculation marginals max marginals tree structured probability distributions
MISC--: their application general graphs involves replicating their iterative local update rules general graph
MISC--: this case however there no guarantees either convergence correctness general
MISC--: understanding characterizing performance message passing algorithms general graphs remains active research area
MISC--: citation show correctness graphs at most one cycle
MISC--: citation show gaussian problems sum product algorithm finds correct means upon convergence but does not always find correct variances
MISC--: citation show asymptotic correctness random graphs associated decoding
MISC--: citation shows if max product converges then optimal relatively large local neighborhood
AIMX--: this paper we consider problem using max product find maximum weight matching arbitrary graph arbitrary edge weights
MISC--: this problem formulated integer program natural lp relaxation
AIMX--: this paper we prove following if lp relaxation tight then max product always converges too correct answer
MISC--: if lp relaxation loose then max product does not converge
OWNX--: bayati shah sharma citation were first investigate max product weighted matching problem
MISC--: they showed if graph bipartite then max product always converges correct answer
MISC--: recently this result been extended symbol matchings bipartite graphs citation
OWNX--: since lp relaxation always tight bipartite graphs first part our results recover their results viewed correct generalization arbitrary graphs since this case tightness function structure well weights
OWNX--: we would like point out three features our work provides necessary sufficient condition convergnce max product arbitrary problem instances
MISC--: there very few non trivial classes problems there tight characterization message passing performance
MISC--: characterization data dependent decided based not only graph structure but also weights particular instance
MISC--: tightness lp relaxations well studied broad classes problems making this chracterization promising terms both understanding development new algorithms
MISC--: relations similarities comparisons between max product linear programming been used mentioned several authors citation exact characterization this relationship general remains interesting endeavor
MISC--: particular would interesting investigate implications results regards elucidating relationship between iterative decoding channel codes lp decoding citation
