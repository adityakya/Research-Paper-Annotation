MISC--: we propose simple randomized strategies sequential decision prediction under imperfect monitoring when decision maker forecaster does not access past outcomes but rather feedback signal
MISC--: proposed strategies consistent sense they achieve asymptotically best possible average reward among all fixed actions
MISC--: was rustichini citation who first proved existence consistent predictors
MISC--: forecasters presented here offer first constructive proof consistency
MISC--: moreover proposed algorithms computationally efficient
OWNX--: we also establish upper bounds rates convergence
MISC--: case deterministic feedback signals rates optimal up logarithmic terms
MISC--: sequential decision problems decision maker forecaster tries predict outcome certain unknown process at each discrete time instance takes action accordingly
OWNX--: depending outcome predicted event action taken decision maker receives reward
MISC--: very often probabilistic modeling underlying process difficult
MISC--: situations prediction problem formalized repeated game between decision maker environment
MISC--: this formulation goes back s when hannan citation blackwell citation showed decision maker randomized strategy guarantees regardless outcome sequence average asymptotic reward high maximal reward one could get knowing empirical distribution outcome sequence advance
MISC--: strategies called hannan consistent
MISC--: prove this result hannan blackwell assumed decision maker full access past outcomes
OWNX--: this case termed full information perfect monitoring case
MISC--: however many important applications decision maker limited information about past elements sequence predicted
MISC--: various models limited feedback been considered literature
MISC--: perhaps best known them so called multi armed bandit problem forecaster only informed its own reward but not actual outcome see ba nos citation megiddo citation foster vohra citation auer cesa bianchi freund schapire citation hart mas colell citation
MISC--: example shown citation hannan consistency achievable this case well
MISC--: sequential decision problems like ones considered this paper been studied different fields under various names repeated games regret minimization line learning prediction individual sequences sequential prediction
MISC--: vocabulary different sub communities differ
OWNX--: ours perhaps closest used learning theorists
MISC--: general introduction survey sequential prediction problem we refer cesa bianchi lugosi citation
AIMX--: this paper we consider general model information available forecaster general given possibly randomized function outcome decision forecaster
CONT--: well understood under what conditions hannan consistency achievable this setup see piccolboni schindelhauer citation cesa bianchi lugosi stoltz citation
OWNX--: roughly speaking this possible whenever after suitable transformations problem reward matrix expressed linear function matrix expected feedback signals
OWNX--: however this condition not always satisfied then natural question what best achievable performance decision maker
OWNX--: this question was answered rustichini citation who characterized maximal achievable average reward guaranteed asymptotically all possible outcome sequences almost sure sense
OWNX--: however rustichini s proof achievability not constructive
MISC--: uses abstract approachability theorems due mertens sorin zamir citation seems unlikely his proof method give rise computationally efficient prediction algorithms noted conclusion citation
MISC--: simplified efficient approachability based strategy special case where feedback function action nature alone was shown mannor shimkin citation
MISC--: general case simplified approachability based strategy citation falls short maximal achievable average reward characterized rustuchini citation
AIMX--: goal this paper develop computationally efficient forecasters general prediction problem under imperfect monitoring achieve best possible asymptotic performance
MISC--: we introduce several forecasting strategies exploit some specific properties problem at hand
OWNX--: we separate four cases according whether feedback signal only depends outcome both outcome forecaster s action whether feedback signal deterministic not
OWNX--: we design different prediction algorithms all four cases
MISC--: product we also obtain finite horizon performance bounds explicit guaranteed rates convergence terms number symbol rounds prediction game played
MISC--: case deterministic feedback signals rates optimal up logarithmic factors
OWNX--: random feedback signal case we do not know if possible construct forecasters significantly smaller regret
MISC--: motivating example prediction problem arises naturally multi access channels prevalent both wired wireless networks
MISC--: networks communication medium shared between multiple decision makers
MISC--: often technically difficult synchronize between decision makers
CONT--: channel sharing protocols particular several variants spread spectrum allow multiple agents use same channel channels may interfere each other simultaneously
MISC--: more specifically consider wireless system where multiple agents choose channel transmit data at any given time
MISC--: quality each channel may different interference other users using this channel other close channels may affect base station reception
MISC--: transmitting agent may choose channel use how much power spend every transmission
MISC--: agent tradeoff between amount power wasted transmission cost having its message only partially received
MISC--: transmitting agent may not receive immediate feedback how much data were received base station even if feedback received often happens much higher layer communication protocol
MISC--: instead transmitting agent monitor transmissions other agents
MISC--: however since transmitting agent physically far base station other agents information about channels chosen other agents amount power they used imperfect
MISC--: this naturally abstracts online learning problem imperfect monitoring
AIMX--: paper structured follows
OWNX--: next section we formalize prediction problem we investigate introduce target quantity best achievable reward notion regret
OWNX--: section we describe some analytical properties key function symbol defined section
OWNX--: this function represents worst possible average reward given vector observations needed our analysis
OWNX--: section we consider simplest special case when actions forecaster do not influence feedback signal moreover deterministic
OWNX--: this case basically easy full information case we obtain regret bound order symbol high probability where symbol number rounds prediction game
OWNX--: section we study random feedback signals but still restriction only determined outcome
OWNX--: here we able obtain regret order symbol
OWNX--: most general case dealt section
MISC--: forecaster introduced there regret order symbol
OWNX--: finally section we show this may improved symbol case deterministic feedback signals known optimal see citation
