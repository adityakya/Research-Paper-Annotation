MISC--: trailing backward compatibility
OWNX--: sty file given sample probability measure support submanifold euclidean space one construct neighborhood graph seen approximation submanifold
MISC--: graph laplacian graph used several machine learning methods like semi supervised learning dimensionality reduction clustering
AIMX--: this paper we determine pointwise limit three different graph laplacians used literature sample size increases neighborhood size approaches zero
OWNX--: we show uniform measure submanifold all graph laplacians same limit up constants
MISC--: however case non uniform measure submanifold only so called random walk graph laplacian converges weighted laplace beltrami operator
MISC--: recent years methods based graph laplacians become increasingly popular machine learning
MISC--: they been used semi supervised learning citation spectral clustering citation dimensionality reduction citation

MISC--: additionally lafon showed use data dependent weights graph allows control influence density
MISC--: they all show bias term converges pointwise if neighborhood size goes zero
MISC--: convergence graph laplacian towards continuous averaging operators was left open
MISC--: this part was first studied citation citation
MISC--: citation convergence was shown so called unnormalized graph laplacian case uniform probability measure compact manifold without boundary using gaussian kernel weights whereas citation pointwise convergence was shown random walk graph laplacian case general probability measures non compact manifolds boundary using general isotropic data dependent weights
