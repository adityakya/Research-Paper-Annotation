MISC--: we introduce algorithmic information theory also known theory kolmogorov complexity
OWNX--: we explain main concepts this quantitative approach defining information
MISC--: we discuss extent kolmogorov s shannon s information theory common purpose where they fundamentally different
AIMX--: we indicate how recent developments within theory allow one formally distinguish between structural meaningful random information measured kolmogorov structure function leads mathematical formalization occam s razor inductive inference
OWNX--: we end discussing some philosophical implications theory
MISC--: how should we measure amount information about phenomenon given us observation concerning phenomenon
MISC--: both classical shannon information theory see chapter citation algorithmic information theory start idea this amount measured minimum number bits needed describe observation
MISC--: but whereas shannon s theory considers description methods optimal relative some given probability distribution kolmogorov s algorithmic theory takes different nonprobabilistic approach any computer program first computes prints string representing observation then terminates viewed valid description
MISC--: amount information string then defined size measured bits shortest computer program outputs string then terminates
OWNX--: similar definition given infinite strings but this case program produces element after element forever
MISC--: thus long sequence s symbol contains little information because program size about symbol bits outputs symbol symbol
MISC--: 
MISC--: 
MISC--: symbol pi forever
OWNX--: definition would appear make amount information string other object depend particular programming language used
OWNX--: fortunately shown all reasonable choices programming languages lead quantification amount absolute information individual objects invariant up additive constant
OWNX--: we call this quantity kolmogorov complexity object
MISC--: while regular strings small kolmogorov complexity random strings kolmogorov complexity about equal their own length
MISC--: measuring complexity information terms program size turned out very powerful idea applications areas theoretical computer science logic probability theory statistics physics paragraph this chapter kolmogorov complexity was introduced independently different motivations r j solomonoff born n kolmogorov g
MISC--: chaitin born respectively citation
MISC--: during last forty years subject developed into major mature area research
OWNX--: here we give brief overview subject geared towards audience specifically interested philosophy information
OWNX--: exception recent work kolmogorov structure function parts discussion philosophical implications all material we discuss here also found standard textbook citation
OWNX--: chapter structured follows we start introductory section we define kolmogorov complexity list its most important properties
OWNX--: we do this much simplified yet formally correct manner avoiding both technicalities all questions motivation why this definition not another one
OWNX--: this followed section provides informal overview more technical topics discussed later this chapter sections
OWNX--: final section discusses theory s philosophical implications well section discusses connection inductive inference less technical again should perhaps glossed over before delving into technicalities sections
