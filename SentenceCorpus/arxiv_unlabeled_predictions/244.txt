OWNX--: approach acceleration parametric weak classifier boosting proposed
MISC--: weak classifier called parametric if fixed number parameters so represented point into multidimensional space
OWNX--: genetic algorithm used instead exhaustive search learn parameters classifier
CONT--: proposed approach also takes cases when effective algorithm learning some classifier parameters exists into account
CONT--: experiments confirm approach dramatically decrease classifier training time while keeping both training test errors small
OWNX--: boosting one commonly used classifier learning approaches
OWNX--: machine learning meta algorithm iteratively learns additive model consisting weighed term weak classifiers belong some classifier family symbol
AIMX--: case two class classification problem we will consider this paper boosted classifier usually form symbol there symbol sample classify symbol weak classifiers learned during boosting procedure symbol weak classifier weights symbol symbol
MISC--: set symbol referred term weak classifier family
MISC--: because elements should error rate only slightly better than random guessing
MISC--: expresses key idea boosting strong classifier built top many weak
MISC--: there many boosting procedures differ type loss being optimized final classifier
CONT--: but no matter what kind boosting procedure used each iteration should select learn weak classifier minimal weighed loss symbol family using special algorithm called term weak learner
MISC--: fast accurate optimization methods often not applicable there especially case discrete classifier parameters so exhaustive search over weak classifier parameter space used weak learner
MISC--: unfortunately exhaustive search take lot time
MISC--: example learning cascade boosted classifiers based haar features term adaboost exhaustive search over classifier parameter space took several weeks famous work citation
CONT--: s why often very important decrease weak classifier learning time using some appropriate numerical optimization approach
OWNX--: one widely used approaches numerical optimization genetic algorithm citation
MISC--: based biological evolution ideas
OWNX--: optimization problem solution coded term chromosome vector term initial population solutions created using random number generator term fitness function then used assign fitness value every population member
OWNX--: solutions biggest fitness values selected next step
MISC--: next step term genetic operators crossover mutation usually applied selected chromosomes produce new solutions modify existing ones slightly
MISC--: modified solutions form up new generation
MISC--: then described process repeats
MISC--: s how evolution modeled
MISC--: continues until global suboptimal solution found time allowed evolution over
MISC--: genetic algorithms often used global extremum search big complicated search spaces
MISC--: makes genetic algorithm good candidate weak classifier learner
