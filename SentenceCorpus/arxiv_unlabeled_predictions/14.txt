MISC--: adaptation rule vector quantization algorithms consequently convergence generated sequence depends existence properties function called energy function defined topological manifold
MISC--: our aim investigate conditions existence function class algorithms examplified initial k means citation kohonen algorithms citation
MISC--: results presented here supplement previous studies including citation citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: our work shows energy function not always potential but at least uniform limit series potential functions we call pseudo potential
MISC--: also shows large number existing vector quantization algorithms developed artificial neural networks community fall into this category
OWNX--: framework we define opens way study convergence all corresponding adaptation rules at once theorem gives promising insights direction
OWNX--: we also demonstrate k means energy function pseudo potential but not potential general
OWNX--: consequently energy function associated neural gas not potential general
MISC--: vector quantization theory citation set prototypes symbol placed manifold symbol order minimize following integral function called energy function symbol where symbol indicates probability density defined symbol
AIMX--: we focus stochastic iterative approaches where at each time step datum symbol drawn probability density function pdf symbol prototypes symbol adapted according symbol using adaptation rule symbol where adaptation step tuned using parameter symbol generally decreasing over time symbol taken thereafter equal without restricting general results symbol neighborhood function particular each vector quantization algorithm
OWNX--: here we focus discontinuous symbol functions
OWNX--: main concern field vector quantization decide whether adaptation rule corresponds not stochastic gradient descent along energy function i e whether this energy function not potential onto entire manifold symbol
AIMX--: one hand if energy function potential then convergence prototypes obeying their adaptation rule toward minimum this energy function well established particular stochastic optimization framework citation this paper concerned
MISC--: example energy function associated k means algorithm citation stochastic version lbg algorithm linde et al citation potential long pdf symbol continuous citation
MISC--: other hand if energy function not potential then very few known about convergence corresponding adaptation rule
MISC--: example several results citation already shown continuous density symbol corresponding vector adaptation rule kohonen self organizing map som algorithm citation citation does not correspond stochastic gradient descent along global energy function convergence although being observed practice turns out very difficult prove not mention most efforts been carried out kohonen rule citation
AIMX--: all vector quantization algorithms we study this paper variants k means algorithm we will see section
MISC--: we know algorithms converge practice toward acceptable value their energy functions whenever they proved associated not potentials
CONT--: however theoretical study their convergence not available so they remain largely heuristics
MISC--: among all algorithms neural gas citation deserves particular attention
MISC--: been claimed its authors associated global potential general hence converging adaptation rule
OWNX--: we propose counter example discontinuous pdf symbol demonstrates this claim not true
MISC--: this shows study convergence all algorithms still its infancy motivates present work
AIMX--: this paper we propose framework encompasses all algorithms
OWNX--: we study this framework we demonstrate energy function associated algorithms not potential general
OWNX--: we also demonstrate this energy function belongs broad class functions includes potential functions special case
MISC--: energy functions within this class called pseudo potentials
OWNX--: results we obtain do not depend continuity probability density function symbol give first step toward explanation why all algorithms shown belong this framework succeed practice minimizing their associated energy function whether they potentials not
MISC--: this framework should open up further avenues general study convergence properties all algorithms contains at once
OWNX--: section we present framework this study
OWNX--: section we define pseudo potential function approximated series potential functions we define concept cellular manifold this series potentials
OWNX--: section we give main theorem states energy function framework necessarily pseudo potential
OWNX--: we consider k means show pseudo potentials not always potentials
MISC--: we discuss consequence convergence corresponding adaptation rule
