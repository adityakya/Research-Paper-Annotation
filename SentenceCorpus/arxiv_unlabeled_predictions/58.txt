MISC--: line shortest path problem considered under various models partial monitoring
MISC--: given weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights change arbitrary adversarial way decision maker choose each round game path between two distinguished vertices loss chosen path defined sum weights its composing edges small possible
MISC--: setting generalizing multi armed bandit problem after choosing path decision maker learns only weights those edges belong chosen path
MISC--: this problem algorithm given whose average cumulative loss symbol rounds exceeds best path matched off line entire sequence edge weights quantity proportional symbol depends only polynomially number edges graph
MISC--: algorithm implemented linear complexity number rounds symbol number edges
MISC--: extension so called label efficient setting also given decision maker informed about weights edges corresponding chosen path at total symbol time instances
MISC--: another extension shown where decision maker competes against time varying path generalization problem tracking best expert
MISC--: version multi armed bandit setting shortest path also discussed where decision maker learns only total weight chosen path but not weights individual edges path
MISC--: applications routing packet switched networks along simulation results also presented
MISC--: sequential decision problem decision maker forecaster performs sequence actions
MISC--: after each action decision maker suffers some loss depending response state environment its goal minimize its cumulative loss over certain period time
MISC--: setting considered here no probabilistic assumption made how losses corresponding different actions generated
MISC--: particular losses may depend previous actions decision maker whose goal perform well relative set reference forecasters so called experts any possible behavior environment
MISC--: more precisely aim decision maker achieve asymptotically same average per round loss best expert
MISC--: research into this problem started s see example blackwell citation hannan citation some basic results gained new life s following work vovk citation littlestone warmuth citation cesa bianchi et al symbol citation
MISC--: results show any bounded loss function if decision maker access past losses all experts then possible construct line algorithms perform any possible behavior environment almost well best symbol experts
MISC--: more precisely per round cumulative loss algorithms at most large best expert plus quantity proportional symbol any bounded loss function where symbol number rounds decision game
MISC--: logarithmic dependence number experts makes possible obtain meaningful bounds even if pool experts very large
MISC--: certain situations decision maker only limited knowledge about losses all possible actions
MISC--: example often natural assume decision maker gets know only loss corresponding action made no information about loss would suffered had made different decision
MISC--: this setup referred multi armed bandit problem was considered adversarial setting auer et al symbol citation who gave algorithm whose normalized regret difference algorithm s average loss best expert upper bounded quantity proportional symbol
MISC--: note compared full information case described above where losses all possible actions revealed decision maker there extra symbol factor performance bound seriously limits usefulness bound if number experts large
MISC--: another interesting example limited information case so called label efficient decision problem see helmbold panizza citation too costly observe state environment so decision maker query losses all possible actions only limited number times
MISC--: recent result cesa bianchi lugosi stoltz citation shows this case if decision maker query losses symbol times during period length symbol then achieve symbol average excess loss relative best expert
MISC--: many applications set experts certain structure may exploited construct efficient line decision algorithms

MISC--: this problem weighted directed acyclic graph given whose edge weights change arbitrary manner decision maker pick each round path between two given vertices weight this path sum weights its composing edges small possible
MISC--: efficient solutions time space complexity proportional number edges rather than number paths latter typically being exponential number edges been given full information case where each round weights all edges revealed after path been chosen see example mohri citation takimoto warmuth citation kalai vempala citation gy orgy et al symbol citation
MISC--: bandit setting only weights edges just sum weights edges composing chosen path revealed decision maker
MISC--: if one applies general bandit algorithm auer et al citation resulting bound will too large practical use because its square root type dependence number paths symbol
MISC--: other hand using special graph structure problem awerbuch kleinberg citation mcmahan blum citation managed get rid exponential dependence number edges performance bound
CONT--: they achieved this extending exponentially weighted average predictor follow perturbed leader algorithm hannan citation generalization multi armed bandit setting shortest paths when only sum weights edges available algorithm
MISC--: however dependence bounds obtained citation citation number rounds symbol significantly worse than symbol bound auer et al citation
MISC--: awerbuch kleinberg citation consider model non oblivious adversaries shortest path i e losses assigned edges depend previous actions forecaster prove symbol bound expected per round regret
MISC--: mcmahan blum citation give simpler algorithm than citation however obtain bound order symbol expected regret
BASE--: this paper we provide extension bandit algorithm auer et al citation unifying advantages above approaches performance bound polynomial number edges converges zero at right symbol rate number rounds increases
OWNX--: we achieve this bound model assumes losses all edges path chosen forecaster available separately after making decision
MISC--: we also discuss case considered citation citation only total loss i e sum losses chosen path known decision maker
