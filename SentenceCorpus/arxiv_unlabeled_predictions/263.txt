AIMX--: we consider class fully stochastic fully distributed algorithms we prove learn equilibria games
OWNX--: indeed we consider family stochastic distributed dynamics we prove converge weakly sense weak convergence probabilistic processes towards their mean field limit i
MISC--: e ordinary differential equation ode general case
AIMX--: we focus then class stochastic dynamics where this ode turns out related multipopulation replicator dynamics
MISC--: well known studied evolutionary game theory
MISC--: using facts known about convergence this ode we discuss convergence initial stochastic dynamics general games there might non convergence but when convergence ode holds considered stochastic algorithms converge towards nash equilibria
OWNX--: games admitting lyapunov functions we call lyapunov games stochastic dynamics converge
OWNX--: we prove any ordinal potential game hence any potential game lyapunov game multiaffine lyapunov function
AIMX--: lyapunov games multiaffine lyapunov function we prove this lyapunov function super martingale over stochastic dynamics
MISC--: this leads way provide bounds their time convergence martingale arguments
MISC--: this applies particular many classes games been considered literature including several load balancing game scenarios congestion games
MISC--: consider scenario where agents learn their experiments small adjustments
MISC--: this might example about choosing their telephone companies about their portfolio investments
OWNX--: we will assume rational
MISC--: assume agents rational
OWNX--: we interested understanding when whole market converge towards rational situations i e nash equilibria sense game theory
OWNX--: this natural expect dynamics adjustments stochastic fully distributed since we expect agents adapt their strategies based their local knowledge market since agents often involved games where global hence local deterministic description whole global market not possible
MISC--: we also want avoid dynamics would suppose global knowledge market say we several dynamics adjustments been considered recently algorithmic game theory literature
OWNX--: up our knowledge this been done mainly deterministic dynamics best response based dynamics computing best response requires global description market
MISC--: stochastic variations avoiding global description been considered
CONT--: however considered dynamics somehow rather ad hoc order get efficient convergence time bounds still mainly best response based
MISC--: we want consider here more general dynamics discuss when one may expect convergence
MISC--: this could lead consider any dynamics monotone respect utility players relation evolutionary game theory literature citation
AIMX--: we propose restrict here dynamics lead dynamics related possibly perturbed replicator dynamics
BASE--: somehow algorithmic game theory seen algorithmic version classical game theory our long term aim better understand algorithmic evolutionary game theory
AIMX--: somehow we could also say best response dynamics seen strategies visit corners simplex mixed strategies we interested long term objective learning methods could seen interior point methods find equilibria
