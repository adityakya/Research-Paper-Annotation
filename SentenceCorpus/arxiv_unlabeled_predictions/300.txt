MISC--: versatility exponential families along their attendant convexity properties make them popular effective statistical model
MISC--: central issue learning models high dimensions when there some sparsity pattern optimal parameter
MISC--: this work characterizes certain strong convexity property general exponential families allow their generalization ability quantified
OWNX--: particular we show how this property used analyze generic exponential families under symbol regularization
MISC--: exponential models perhaps most versatile pragmatic statistical model variety reasons modelling flexibility encompassing discrete variables continuous variables covariance matrices time series graphical models etc convexity properties allowing ease optimization robust generalization ability
MISC--: principal issue applicability large scale problems estimating models when ambient dimension parameters symbol much larger than sample size symbol symbol regime
OWNX--: much recent work focused this problem special case linear regression high dimensions where assumed optimal parameter vector sparse e g citation
MISC--: this body prior work focused sharply characterizing convergence rates prediction loss consistent model selection obtaining sparse models
MISC--: we tackle more challenging problems there growing need model selection more general exponential families
MISC--: recent work here includes learning gaussian graphs citation ising models citation
MISC--: classical results established consistent estimation general exponential families possible asymptotic limit where number dimensions held constant though some work establishes rates under certain conditions symbol allowed grow slowly symbol citation
OWNX--: however modern problems we typically grow symbol rapidly symbol so even asymptotically we often interested regime where symbol case sparse estimation
AIMX--: while we handle this question variety special cases pressing question here understanding how fast symbol scale function symbol general exponential families analysis must quantify relevant aspects particular family at hand govern their convergence rate
MISC--: this focus this work
AIMX--: we should emphasize throughout this paper while we interested modelling exponential family we agnostic about true underlying distribution e
OWNX--: g we do not necessarily assume data generating process exponential family paragraph our contributions related work key issue analyzing convergence rates exponential families terms their prediction loss we take log loss characterizing nature they strictly convex roughly speaking asymptotic regime where we large sample size symbol symbol kept fixed we central limit theorem effect where log loss any exponential family approaches log loss gaussian covariance matrix corresponding fisher information matrix
OWNX--: our first main contribution quantifying rate at this effect occurs general exponential families
OWNX--: particular we show every exponential family satisfies certain rather natural growth rate condition their standardized moments standardized cumulants recall symbol th standardized moment unitless ratio symbol th central moment symbol th power standard deviation symbol skew kurtosis
MISC--: this condition rather mild where moments grow fast symbol
MISC--: interestingly similar conditions been well studied obtaining exponential tail bounds convergence random variable its mean citation
OWNX--: we show this growth rate characterizes rate at prediction loss exponential family behaves strongly convex loss function
CONT--: particular our analysis draws many parallels analysis newton s method where there burn phase number iterations must occur until function behaves locally quadratic function our statistical setting we now require quantified burn sample size where beyond this threshold sample size prediction loss inherits desired strong convexity properties i e locally quadratic
OWNX--: our second contribution analysis symbol regularization generic families terms both prediction loss sparsity level selected model
OWNX--: under particular sparse eigenvalue condition design matrix restricted eigenvalue re condition citation we show how symbol regularization general exponential families enjoys convergence rate symbol where symbol number relevant features
MISC--: this re condition one least stringent conditions permit this optimal convergence rate linear regression case see citation stronger mutual incoherence irrepresentable conditions considered citation also provide this rate
OWNX--: we show essentially identical convergence rate achieved general exponential families our results non asymptotic precisely relate symbol symbol
OWNX--: our final contribution one approximate sparse model selection i e where our goal obtain sparse model low prediction loss
MISC--: drawback re condition comparison mutual incoherence condition latter permits perfect recovery true features at price more stringent condition
OWNX--: however case linear regression citation show under sparse eigenvalue re condition symbol solution actually sparse itself multiplicative increase sparsity level depends certain condition number design matrix so while symbol solution may not precisely recover true model still sparse some multiplicative increase does recover those features large true weights
OWNX--: general exponential families while we do not characterization sparsity level symbol regularized solution interesting open question we do however provide simple two stage procedure thresholding refitting provides sparse model support no more than merely symbol features nearly good performance rather mild increase risk this result novel even square loss case
OWNX--: hence even under rather mild re condition we obtain both favorable convergence rate sparse model generic families
