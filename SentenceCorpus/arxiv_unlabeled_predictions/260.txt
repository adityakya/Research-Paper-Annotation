MISC--: dirichlet process dp mixture models provide flexible bayesian framework density estimation
MISC--: unfortunately their flexibility comes at cost inference dp mixture models computationally expensive even when conjugate distributions used
AIMX--: common case when one seeks only maximum posteriori assignment data points clusters we show search algorithms provide practical alternative expensive mcmc variational techniques
MISC--: when true posterior sample desired solution found search serve good initializer mcmc
MISC--: experimental results show using techniques possible apply dp mixture models very large data sets
MISC--: dirichlet process dp mixture models provide flexible bayesian solution nonparametric density estimation
MISC--: their flexibility derives fact one need not specify number mixture components priori
MISC--: practice dp mixture models been used problems genomics citation relational learning citation data mining citation vision citation
MISC--: despite successes flexibility dp mixture models comes at high computational cost
MISC--: standard algorithms based mcmc those described namecite neal dpmm computationally expensive take long time converge stationary distribution
MISC--: variational techniques citation attractive alternative but difficult implement remain slow
AIMX--: this paper we show standard search algorithms beam search provide attractive alternative expensive techniques
MISC--: our algorithms allows one apply dp mixture models very large data sets
OWNX--: like variational approaches dp mixture models we focus conjugate distributions exponential family
MISC--: unlike mcmc techniques produce samples cluster assignments corresponding posterior our search based techniques will only find approximate map cluster assignment
OWNX--: we do not believe this strong limitation practice applications cited above all use mcmc techniques draw sample then simply choose this sample single assignment highest posterior probability
MISC--: if one needs samples posterior then solution found our methods could initialize mcmc
