MISC--: walley s imprecise dirichlet model idm categorical iid data extends classical dirichlet model set priors
MISC--: overcomes several fundamental problems other approaches uncertainty suffer
MISC--: yet useful practice one needs efficient ways computing imprecise robust sets intervals
MISC--: main objective this work derive exact conservative approximate robust credible interval estimates under idm large class statistical estimators including entropy mutual information
MISC--: this work derives interval estimates under imprecise dirichlet model idm citation large class statistical estimators
OWNX--: idm one considers iid process unknown chances symbol outcome symbol
MISC--: prior uncertainty about symbol modeled set dirichlet priors symbol where symbol symbol hyper parameter typically chosen between
MISC--: sets probability distributions often called imprecise probabilities hence name idm this model
OWNX--: we avoid term imprecise use robust instead capitalize imprecise
MISC--: idm overcomes several fundamental problems other approaches uncertainty suffer citation
MISC--: instance idm satisfies representation invariance principle symmetry principle mutually exclusive pure bayesian treatment proper prior citation
MISC--: symbol counts symbol symbol form minimal sufficient statistic data size symbol
MISC--: statistical estimators symbol usually also depend chosen prior so set priors leads set estimators symbol
OWNX--: instance expected chances symbol lead robust interval estimate symbol
MISC--: robust intervals variance symbol citation mean variance linear combinations symbol also been derived citation
OWNX--: bayesian estimators like expectations depend symbol symbol only through symbol symbol we suppress i e symbol
MISC--: main objective this work derive approximate conservative exact intervals symbol general symbol expected also called predictive entropy expected mutual information particular
OWNX--: results key building blocks applying idm
MISC--: walley suggests instance use symbol inference problems symbol decision problems citation where symbol some function symbol
MISC--: one application inference robust tree dependency structures citation edges partially ordered based imprecise mutual information
OWNX--: section gives brief introduction idm describes our problem setup
OWNX--: section we derive exact robust intervals concave functions symbol entropy
