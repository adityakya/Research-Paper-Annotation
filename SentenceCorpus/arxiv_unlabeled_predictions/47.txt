MISC--: kohonen self organisation maps well know classification tool commonly used wide variety problems but limited applications time series forecasting context
AIMX--: this paper we propose forecasting method specifically designed multi dimensional long term trends prediction double application kohonen algorithm
MISC--: practical applications method also presented
MISC--: time series forecasting problem encountered many fields applications finance returns stock markets hydrology river floods engineering electrical consumption etc
MISC--: many methods designed time series forecasting perform well depending complexity problem rather short term horizon but rather poor longer term one
MISC--: this due fact methods usually designed optimize performance at short term their use at longer term being not optimized
OWNX--: furthermore they generally carry out prediction single value while real problem sometimes requires predicting vector future values one step
OWNX--: example case some priori known periodicity could interesting predict all values period whole
MISC--: but forecasting vector requires either more complex models potential loss performance some vector components many distinct single value predicting models potential loss correlation information between various values
MISC--: methods able forecast whole vector same precision each its components thus great interest
MISC--: while enlarging prediction horizon course primary interest practitioners there course some limit accuracy expected long term forecast
MISC--: limitation due availability information itself not possible limitations forecasting methods
MISC--: indeed there no doubt whatever forecasting method used predicting at long term i e many time steps advance more difficult predicting at short term because missing information unknown future time steps those between last known value one predict
OWNX--: at some term all prediction methods will thus fail
OWNX--: purpose method presented this paper not enlarge time horizon accurate predictions could expected but rather enlarge horizon we insights about future evolution series
MISC--: insights we mean some information interest practitioner even if does not mean accurate predictions
MISC--: example there bounds future values
OWNX--: what we expect average
OWNX--: confidence intervals future values large narrow
MISC--: predicting many steps advance could realized straightforward way subsampling known sequence then using any short term prediction method
CONT--: however this case loss information used forecast obviously even higher due lower resolution known sequence
OWNX--: furthermore solution does not allow general way introduce stochastic aspect method key issue proposed method
MISC--: indeed get insights about future evolution series through some statistics expected mean variance confidence intervals quartiles etc several predictions should made order extract statistics
MISC--: predictions should differ stochastic prediction method able generate several forecasts repeated monte carlo runs
OWNX--: method presented this paper stochastic character method results use random draws probability law
OWNX--: another attractive aspect method presented this paper used predict scalar values vectors same expected precision each component case vector prediction
OWNX--: having at disposal time series values symbol symbol prediction vector defined follows symbol where symbol size vector predicted symbol data generating process symbol number past values influence future values symbol centred noise vector
MISC--: past values gathered symbol dimensional vector called regressor
MISC--: knowledge symbol values time series symbol symbol means relation known many symbol time steps past
MISC--: modeling problem then becomes estimate function symbol models correctly time series whole set past regressors
OWNX--: idea method segment space symbol dimensional regressors
OWNX--: this segmentation seen way make possible local modeling each segment
MISC--: this part method achieved using self organizing map som citation
MISC--: prototypes obtained each class model locally regressors corresponding class
OWNX--: furthermore order take into account temporal dependences series deformation regressors built
MISC--: those vectors constructed differences between two consecutive regressors
MISC--: set regressor deformations also segmented using som
MISC--: once those two spaces segmented their dependences characterized simulations performed
MISC--: using kind monte carlo procedure repeat simulations then possible estimate distribution simulations forecast global trends time series at long term
MISC--: though we could chosen some other classical vector quantization vq method only clustering property interest here choice som tool perform segmentation two spaces justified fact som efficient fast compared other vq methods limited complexity citation they provide intuitive helpful graphical representation
AIMX--: following this paper we first recall some basic concepts about som classification tool
OWNX--: then we introduce proposed forecasting method double vector quantization scalar time series then vector ones
OWNX--: next we present some experimental results both scalar vector forecastings
OWNX--: proof method stability given appendix
