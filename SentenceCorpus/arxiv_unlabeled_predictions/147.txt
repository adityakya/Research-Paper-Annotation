OWNX--: we give characterization maximum entropy minimum relative entropy inference providing two strong entropy concentration theorems
MISC--: theorems unify generalize jaynes concentration phenomenon van campenhout cover s conditional limit theorem
MISC--: theorems characterize exactly what sense prior distribution symbol conditioned given constraint distribution symbol minimizing symbol over all symbol satisfying constraint close each other
OWNX--: we then apply our theorems establish relationship between entropy concentration game theoretic characterization maximum entropy inference due tops o e others
MISC--: jaynes maximum entropy maxent principle well known principle inductive inference citation
MISC--: been applied statistical machine learning problems ranging protein modeling stock market prediction citation
MISC--: one its characterizations some would say justifications so called concentration phenomenon citation
BASE--: here informal version this phenomenon words citation case prior distribution over domain at hand available citation proven related conditional limit theorem
OWNX--: sections we provide strong generalization both concentration phenomenon conditional limit theorem
OWNX--: section results section used extend existing game theoretic characterization again some would say justification maximum entropy due citation
OWNX--: this way we provide sharper results two most frequently cited characterizations maximum entropy principle
