OWNX--: we show brier game prediction mixable find optimal learning rate substitution function
OWNX--: resulting prediction algorithm applied predict results football tennis matches
OWNX--: theoretical performance guarantee turns out rather tight data sets especially case more extensive tennis data
MISC--: paradigm prediction expert advice was introduced late s see eg citation citation citation been applied various loss functions see citation recent book length review
MISC--: especially important class loss functions mixable ones learner s loss made small best expert s loss plus constant depending number experts
CONT--: known citation optimal additive constant attained strong aggregating algorithm proposed citation we use adjective strong distinguish weak aggregating algorithm citation
MISC--: there several important loss functions been shown mixable optimal additive constant been found
MISC--: prime examples case binary observations log loss function square loss function
MISC--: log loss function whose mixability obvious been explored extensively along its important generalizations kullback leibler divergence cover s loss function
AIMX--: this paper we concentrate square loss function
MISC--: binary case its mixability was demonstrated citation
MISC--: there two natural directions this result could generalized regression observations real numbers square loss regression standard problem statistics classification observations take values finite set this leads brier game defined below standard way measuring quality predictions meteorology other applied fields see eg citation
MISC--: mixability square loss function case observations belonging bounded interval real numbers was demonstrated citation haussler et al s algorithm was simplified citation
MISC--: surprisingly case square loss non binary classification never been analysed framework prediction expert advice
AIMX--: purpose this paper fill this gap
MISC--: its short conference version citation appeared icml proceedings
