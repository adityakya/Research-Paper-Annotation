OWNX--: we consider task learning classifier feature space symbol set classes symbol when features partitioned into class conditionally independent feature sets symbol symbol
MISC--: we show surprising fact class conditional independence used represent original learning task terms learning classifier symbol symbol learning class conditional distribution feature set symbol
OWNX--: this fact exploited semi supervised learning because former task accomplished purely unlabeled samples
OWNX--: we present experimental evaluation idea two real world applications
MISC--: semi supervised learning said occur when learner exploits presumably large quantity unlabeled data supplement relatively small labeled sample accurate induction
MISC--: high cost labeled data simultaneous plenitude unlabeled data many application domains led considerable interest semi supervised learning recent years
OWNX--: we show somewhat surprising consequence class conditional feature independence leads simple semi supervised learning algorithm
MISC--: when feature set partitioned into two class conditionally independent sets we show original learning problem reformulated terms problem learning predictor one partitions other
MISC--: latter partition acts surrogate class variable
OWNX--: since predictor learned only unlabeled samples effective semi supervised algorithm results
OWNX--: next section we present simple yet interesting result our semi supervised learning algorithm we call surrogate learning based
OWNX--: we present examples clarify intuition behind approach present special case our approach used applications section
AIMX--: we then examine related ideas previous work situate our algorithm among previous approaches semi supervised learning
OWNX--: we present empirical evaluation two real world applications where required assumptions our algorithm satisfied
