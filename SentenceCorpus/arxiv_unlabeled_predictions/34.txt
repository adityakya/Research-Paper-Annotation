MISC--: canonical correlation analysis technique extract common features pair multivariate data
MISC--: complex situations however does not extract useful features because its linearity
OWNX--: other hand kernel method used support vector machine efficient approach improve linear method
OWNX--: this paper we investigate effectiveness applying kernel method canonical correlation analysis keyword multivariate analysis multimodal data kernel method regularization
OWNX--: this paper deals method extract common features multiple information sources
MISC--: instance let us consider task learning pattern recognition object given using image its name given speech
MISC--: newly given image system required answer its name speech newly given speech system answer corresponding image
MISC--: task considered regression problem image speech vice versa
MISC--: however since dimensionalities images speeches generally very large regression analysis many not work effectively
MISC--: order solve problem useful map inputs into low dimensional feature space then solve regression problem
MISC--: canonical correlation analysis cca been used purpose
MISC--: cca finds linear transformation pair multi variates correlation coefficient maximized
MISC--: information theoretical point view transformation maximizes mutual information between extracted features
MISC--: however if there nonlinear relation between variates cca does not always extract useful features
OWNX--: other hand support vector machines svm attracted lot attention its state art performance pattern recognition citation kernel trick used svm applicable not only classification but also other linear techniques example kernel regression kernel pca citation this paper we apply kernel method cca
OWNX--: since kernel method likely overfit data we incorporate some regularization technique avoid overfitting
