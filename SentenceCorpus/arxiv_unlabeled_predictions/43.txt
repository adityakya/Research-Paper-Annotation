OWNX--: symbolic dynamics proven invaluable tool analyzing mechanisms lead unpredictability random behavior nonlinear dynamical systems
MISC--: surprisingly discrete partition continuous state space produce coarse grained description behavior accurately describes invariant properties underlying chaotic attractor
MISC--: particular measures rate information production topological metric entropy rates estimated outputs markov generating partitions
OWNX--: here we develop bayesian inference symbol th order markov chains method finding generating partitions estimating entropy rates finite samples discretized data produced coarse grained dynamical systems
MISC--: research chaotic dynamical systems during last forty years produced new vision origins randomness
OWNX--: now widely understood observed randomness generated low dimensional deterministic systems exhibit chaotic attractor
MISC--: today when confronted what appears high dimensional stochastic process one now asks whether not process instead hidden low dimensional but nonlinear dynamical system
OWNX--: this awareness though requires new way looking at apparently random data since chaotic dynamics very sensitive measurement process citation both blessing curse turns out
MISC--: symbolic dynamics one suite tools dynamical systems theory its most basic form addresses this issue considering coarse grained view continuous dynamics this sense any finite precision instrument measures chaotic system induces symbolic representation underlying continuous valued behavior
MISC--: effectively model time series discrete data continuous state system two concerns must addressed
OWNX--: first we must consider measurement instrument representation true dynamics provides
OWNX--: second we must consider inference models based this data
MISC--: relation between steps more subtle than one might expect
OWNX--: we will demonstrate one hand measurement chaotic data instrument should designed maximize entropy rate resulting data stream
MISC--: this allows one extract much information each measurement possible
MISC--: other hand model inference strives minimize apparent randomness entropy rate over class alternative models
MISC--: this reflects search determinism structure data
OWNX--: here we address interplay between optimal instruments optimal models analyzing relatively simple nonlinear system
OWNX--: we consider design binary output instruments chaotic maps additive noise
OWNX--: we then use bayesian inference symbol th order markov chain model resulting data stream
MISC--: our model system one dimensional chaotic map additive noise citation symbol where symbol symbol symbol gaussian random variable mean zero variance symbol
OWNX--: start we consider design instruments zero noise limit
MISC--: this regime most previous work symbolic dynamics provides convenient frame reference
MISC--: construction symbolic dynamics representation continuous state system goes follows citation
MISC--: we assume time discrete consider map symbol state space symbol itself symbol
MISC--: this space partitioned into finite set symbol nonoverlapping regions many ways
MISC--: most powerful called markov partition must satisfy two conditions
MISC--: first image each region symbol must union intervals symbol
MISC--: second map symbol restricted interval must one one onto
MISC--: if markov partition cannot found system under consideration next best coarse graining called generating partition
MISC--: one dimensional maps often easily found using extrema symbol its critical points
MISC--: critical points map used divide state space into intervals symbol over symbol monotone
MISC--: note markov partitions generating but converse not generally true
MISC--: given any partition symbol then series continuous valued states symbol projected onto its symbolic representation symbol
MISC--: latter simply associated sequence partition element indices
MISC--: this done defining operator symbol returns unique symbol symbol each symbol alphabet symbol when symbol
OWNX--: central result symbolic dynamics establishes using generating partition increasingly long sequences observed symbols identify smaller smaller regions state space
MISC--: starting system region produces associated measurement symbol sequence
MISC--: limit infinite symbol sequences result discrete symbol representation continuous state system representation we will show often much easier analyze
AIMX--: this way chosen partition creates symbol sequence symbol describes continuous dynamics sequence symbols
OWNX--: choice partition then equivalent our instrument design problem
MISC--: effectiveness partition zero noise limit quantified estimating entropy rate resulting symbolic sequence
OWNX--: do this we consider length symbol words symbol
MISC--: block entropy length symbol sequences obtained partition symbol then symbol where symbol probability observing word symbol
MISC--: block entropy entropy rate estimated following limit symbol practice often more accurate calculate length symbol estimate entropy rate using symbol another key result symbolic dynamics says entropy original continuous system found using generating partitions citation
MISC--: particular true entropy rate maximizes estimated entropy rates symbol thus translated into statement about experiment design results tell us design instrument so maximizes observed entropy rate
OWNX--: this reflects fact we want each measurement produce most information possible
OWNX--: useful benchmark this useful only case when we know symbol piesin s identity citation tells us value symbol equal sum positive lyapunov characteristic exponents symbol
OWNX--: one dimensional maps there single lyapunov exponent numerically estimated map symbol observed trajectory symbol using symbol taken altogether results tell us how design our instrument effective observation deterministic chaos
MISC--: notably presence noise no theorems exist
MISC--: however citation demonstrated methods developed above robust presence noise
OWNX--: any case we view output instrument stochastic process
OWNX--: sample realization symbol length symbol measurements taken finite alphabet basis our inference problem symbol
MISC--: our purposes here sample generated partition continuous state sequences iterations one dimensional map states chaotic attractor
MISC--: this means particular stochastic process stationary
OWNX--: we assume addition alphabet binary symbol
