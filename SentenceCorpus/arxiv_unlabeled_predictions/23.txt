OWNX--: we derive exact efficient bayesian regression algorithm piecewise constant functions unknown segment number boundary location levels
OWNX--: works any noise segment level prior eg cauchy handle outliers
OWNX--: we derive simple but good estimates segment variance
OWNX--: we also propose bayesian regression curve better way smoothing data without blurring boundaries
OWNX--: bayesian approach also allows straightforward determination evidence break probabilities error estimates useful model selection significance robustness studies
OWNX--: we discuss performance synthetic real world examples
MISC--: many possible extensions will discussed
OWNX--: we consider problem fitting piecewise constant function through noisy one dimensional data eg figure where segment number boundaries levels unknown
MISC--: regression piecewise constant pc functions also known change point detection many applications
OWNX--: instance determining dna copy numbers cancer cells micro array data mention just one recent
OWNX--: we provide full bayesian analysis pc regression
OWNX--: fixed number segments we choose uniform prior over all possible segment boundary locations
OWNX--: some prior segment levels data noise within each segment assumed
MISC--: finally prior over number segments chosen
OWNX--: this we obtain posterior segmentation probability distribution section
OWNX--: practice we need summaries this complicated distribution
MISC--: simple maximum map approximation mean does not work here
OWNX--: right way proceed stages determining most critical segment number boundary location finally then trivial segment levels
OWNX--: we also extract evidence boundary probability distribution interesting non pc regression curve including error estimate section
OWNX--: we derive exact polynomial time dynamic programming type algorithm all quantities interest sections
OWNX--: our algorithm works any noise level prior
OWNX--: we consider more closely gaussian standard prior heavy tailed robust outliers distributions like cauchy briefly discuss non parametric case sections
OWNX--: finally some hyper parameters like global data average variability local within level noise determined
OWNX--: we introduce discuss efficient semi principled estimators thereby avoiding problematic expensive numerical em monte carlo estimates section
OWNX--: we test our method some synthetic examples section some real world data sets section
OWNX--: simulations show our method handles difficult data high noise outliers well
OWNX--: our basic algorithm easily modified variety ways discrete segment levels segment dependent variance piecewise linear non linear regression non parametric noise prior etc section
MISC--: sen srivastava citation developed frequentist solution problem detecting single most prominent segment boundary called change break point
MISC--: olshen et al citation generalize this method detect pairs break points improves recognition short segments
MISC--: both methods then heuristically used recursively determine further change points
MISC--: another approach penalized maximum likelihood ml
MISC--: fixed number segments ml chooses boundary locations maximize data likelihood minimize mean square data deviation
CONT--: jong et al citation use population based algorithm minimizer while picard et al citation use dynamic programming structurally very close our core recursion find exact solution polynomial time
MISC--: additional penalty term added likelihood order determine correct number segments
MISC--: most principled penalty bayesian information criterion citation
MISC--: since biased towards too simple citation too complex citation models practice often heuristic penalty used
MISC--: interesting heuristic based curvature log likelihood function number segments been used citation
OWNX--: our bayesian regressor natural response penalized ml
MISC--: many other regressors exist too numerous list them all
MISC--: another closely related work ours bayesian bin density estimation endres f oldi ak citation who also average over all boundary locations but context density estimation
MISC--: full bayesian approach when computationally feasible various advantages over others generic advantage more principled hence involves fewer heuristic design choices
MISC--: this particularly important estimating number segments
MISC--: another generic advantage easily embedded larger framework
MISC--: instance one decide among competing models solely based bayesian evidence
MISC--: finally bayes often works well practice provably so if model assumptions valid
OWNX--: we also extract other information nearly free like probability estimates variances various quantities interest
MISC--: particularly interesting expected level variance each data point
MISC--: this leads regression curve very flat i e smoothes data long clear segments wiggles less clear segments follows trends jumps at segment boundaries
MISC--: thus behaves somewhat between local smoothing wiggles more blurs jumps rigid pc segmentation
