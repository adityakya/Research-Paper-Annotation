OWNX--: problem joint universal source coding modeling addressed rissanen context lossless codes generalized fixed rate lossy coding continuous alphabet memoryless sources
OWNX--: we show bounded distortion measures any compactly parametrized family iid
MISC--: real vector sources absolutely continuous marginals satisfying appropriate smoothness vapnik chervonenkis learnability conditions admits joint scheme universal lossy block coding parameter estimation give nonasymptotic estimates convergence rates distortion redundancies variational distances between active source estimated source
OWNX--: we also present explicit examples parametric sources admitting joint universal compression modeling schemes
OWNX--: universal data compression single code achieves asymptotically optimal performance all sources within given family
MISC--: intuition suggests good universal coder should acquire accurate model source statistics sufficiently long data sequence incorporate this knowledge its operation
MISC--: lossless codes this intuition been made rigorous rissanen citation
MISC--: under his scheme data encoded two stage set up binary representation each source block consists two parts suitably quantized maximum likelihood estimate source parameters lossless encoding data matched acquired model redundancy resulting code converges zero symbol where symbol block length
OWNX--: this paper we extend rissanen s idea lossy block coding vector quantization iid
OWNX--: sources values symbol some finite symbol

MISC--: source marginal distribution symbol belonging some indexed class symbol absolutely continuous distributions symbol where symbol bounded subset symbol some symbol
MISC--: bounded distortion measures our main result theorem states if class symbol satisfies certain smoothness learnability conditions then there exists sequence finite memory lossy block codes achieves asymptotically optimal compression each source class permits asymptotically exact identification active source respect variational distance defined symbol where supremum over all borel subsets symbol
MISC--: overhead rate distortion redundancy scheme converge zero symbol symbol respectively where symbol block length while active source identified up variational ball radius symbol eventually almost surely
OWNX--: we also describe extension our scheme unbounded distortion measures satisfying certain moment condition present two examples parametric families satisfying regularity conditions theorem
