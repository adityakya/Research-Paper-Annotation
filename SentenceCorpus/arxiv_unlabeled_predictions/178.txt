MISC--: general purpose intelligent learning agents cycle through complex non mdp sequences observations actions rewards
MISC--: other hand reinforcement learning well developed small finite state markov decision processes mdps
MISC--: so far art performed human designers extract right state representation out bare observations ie reduce agent setup mdp framework
OWNX--: before we think mechanizing this search suitable mdps we need formal objective criterion
OWNX--: main contribution this article develop criterion
MISC--: i also integrate various parts into one learning algorithm
MISC--: extensions more realistic dynamic bayesian networks developed companion article citation keywords evolutionary algorithms ranking selection tournament selection equivalence efficiency
MISC--: artificial general intelligence agi concerned designing agents perform well wide range environments citation
MISC--: among well established narrow ai approaches arguably reinforcement learning rl pursues most directly same goal
MISC--: rl considers general agent environment setup agent interacts environment acts observes cycles receives occasional rewards
MISC--: agent s objective collect much reward possible
MISC--: most if not all ai problems formulated this framework
MISC--: simplest interesting environmental class consists finite state fully observable markov decision processes mdps citation reasonably well understood
MISC--: extensions continuous states non linear function approximation citation partial observability pomdp citation structured mdps dbns citation others been considered but algorithms much more brittle
MISC--: any case lot work still left designer namely extract right state representation features out bare observations
MISC--: even if potentially useful representations been found usually not clear one will turn out better except situations where we already know perfect model
MISC--: think mobile robot equipped camera plunged into unknown environment
OWNX--: while we imagine image features potentially useful we cannot know ones will actually useful
OWNX--: before we think mechanically searching best mdp representation we need formal objective criterion
MISC--: obviously at any point time if we want criterion effective only depend agents past experience
OWNX--: main contribution this article develop criterion
MISC--: reality non ergodic partially observable uncertain unknown environment acquiring experience expensive
MISC--: so we want need exploit data past experience at hand optimally cannot generate virtual samples since model not given need learned itself there no reset option
MISC--: regression classification penalized maximum likelihood criteria citation successfully been used semi parametric model selection
OWNX--: far obvious how apply them rl
OWNX--: ultimately we do not care about observations but rewards
MISC--: rewards depend states but states arbitrary sense they model dependent functions data
MISC--: indeed our derived cost function cannot interpreted usual model data code length
MISC--: partly detailed later suggested symbol mdp model could regarded scaled down practical instantiation aixi citation way side step open problem learning pomdps extending idea state aggregation planning based bi simulation metrics citation rl based code length generalizing u tree citation arbitrary features alternative psrs citation proper learning algorithms yet developed
MISC--: throughout this article symbol denotes binary logarithm symbol empty string symbol if symbol symbol else kronecker symbol
MISC--: i generally omit separating commas if no confusion arises particular indices
MISC--: any symbol suitable type string vector set i define string symbol sum symbol union symbol vector symbol where symbol ranges over full range symbol symbol length dimension size symbol
MISC--: symbol denotes estimate symbol
MISC--: symbol denotes probability over states rewards parts thereof
MISC--: i do not distinguish between random variables symbol realizations symbol abbreviation symbol never leads confusion
CONT--: more specifically symbol denotes number states symbol any state index symbol current time symbol any time
CONT--: further order not get distracted at several places i gloss over initial conditions special cases where inessential
MISC--: also symbol undefined symbol infinity
