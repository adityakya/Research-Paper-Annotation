OWNX--: symbol adic modification split lbg classification method presented first clusterings then cluster centers computed locally minimise energy function
MISC--: outcome fixed dataset independent prime number symbol finitely many exceptions
MISC--: methods applied construction symbol adic classifiers context learning
MISC--: field symbol symbol adic numbers interest hierarchical classification because its inherent hierarchical structure citation
MISC--: great amount work deals finding symbol adic data representation e g citation
MISC--: citation use more general symbol adic numbers encoding hierarchical data was advocated order able include case non binary dendrograms into scheme without having resort larger prime number symbol
MISC--: this was applied citation special case data consisting words over given alphabet where proximity words defined length common initial part
MISC--: there agglomerative hierarchic symbol adic clustering algorithm was described
MISC--: however question finding optimal clusterings symbol adic data was not raised
MISC--: already citation performance classical symbol adic classification algorithms was compared segmentation moving images
OWNX--: was observed symbol adic ones were often more efficient
MISC--: learning algorithms using symbol adic neural networks described citation
OWNX--: inspired citation our main concern this article will symbol adic adaptation so called split lbg method finds energy optimal clusterings data
MISC--: name lbg refers initials authors citation where described first
OWNX--: their method find cluster centers then group data around centers
MISC--: next step cluster centers split more clusters obtained
MISC--: this process repeated until desired class number attained
OWNX--: symbol adic data this approach does not make sense first all cluster centers general not unique secondly because dendrogram already determined data arbitrary choice cluster centers not possible this lead incomplete clusterings
OWNX--: hence we first find clusterings refining direction highest energy reduction until class number exceeds prescribed bound
MISC--: thereafter candidates cluster centers computed they minimise cluster energy
MISC--: result sub optimal method symbol adic classification splits given cluster into its maximal proper subclusters
OWNX--: variant discards first all quasi singletons i e clusters energy below threshold value
MISC--: posteriori choice centers turns out useful constructing efficient classifiers
MISC--: first application some methods described here event history data building stocks described citation
MISC--: there classification algorithm performed different symbol adic encodings data order compare dynamics some sampled municipal building stocks
OWNX--: after introducing notations section we briefly describe classical split lbg method section
MISC--: section reformulates minimisation task split lbg symbol adic setting describes corresponding algorithms
OWNX--: issue choice prime symbol dealt section
OWNX--: section constructs classifiers presents adaptive learning method accumulated clusters large energy split
