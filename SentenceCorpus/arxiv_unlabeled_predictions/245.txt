MISC--: general purpose intelligent learning agents cycle through sequences observations actions rewards complex uncertain unknown non markovian
MISC--: other hand reinforcement learning well developed small finite state markov decision processes mdps
MISC--: up now extracting right state representations out bare observations reducing general agent setup mdp framework art involves significant effort designers
MISC--: primary goal this work automate reduction process thereby significantly expand scope many existing reinforcement learning algorithms agents employ them
OWNX--: before we think mechanizing this search suitable mdps we need formal objective criterion
OWNX--: main contribution this article develop criterion
MISC--: i also integrate various parts into one learning algorithm
MISC--: extensions more realistic dynamic bayesian networks developed part ii citation
MISC--: role pomdps also considered there
MISC--: artificial general intelligence agi concerned designing agents perform well wide range environments citation
MISC--: among well established narrow artificial intelligence ai approaches citation arguably reinforcement learning rl citation pursues most directly same goal
MISC--: rl considers general agent environment setup agent interacts environment acts observes cycles receives occasional rewards
MISC--: agent s objective collect much reward possible
MISC--: most if not all ai problems formulated this framework
OWNX--: since future generally unknown uncertain agent needs learn model environment based past experience allows predict future rewards use this maximize expected long term reward
MISC--: simplest interesting environmental class consists finite state fully observable markov decision processes mdps citation reasonably well understood
MISC--: extensions continuous states non linear function approximation citation partial observability pomdp citation structured mdps dbns citation others been considered but algorithms much more brittle
OWNX--: way tackle complex real world problems reduce them finite mdps we know how deal efficiently
CONT--: this approach leaves lot work designer namely extract right state representation features out bare observations initial formal informal problem description
MISC--: even if potentially useful representations been found usually not clear ones will turn out better except situations where we already know perfect model
MISC--: think mobile robot equipped camera plunged into unknown environment
OWNX--: while we imagine image features will potentially useful we cannot know advance ones will actually useful
AIMX--: primary goal this paper develop investigate method automatically selects those features necessary sufficient reducing complex real world problem computationally tractable mdp
OWNX--: formally we consider maps symbol past observation reward action history symbol agent mdp state
MISC--: histories not worth being distinguished mapped same state i e symbol induces partition set histories
OWNX--: we call this model symbol mdp
MISC--: state may simply abstract label partition but more often itself structured object like discrete vector
MISC--: each vector component describes one feature history citation
MISC--: example state may vector containing shape color size object robot tracks
AIMX--: this reason we call reduction feature rl although this part i only simpler unstructured case considered
MISC--: symbol maps agent s experience over time into sequence mdp states
MISC--: rather than informally constructing symbol hand our goal develop formal objective criterion symbol evaluating different reductions symbol
MISC--: obviously at any point time if we want criterion effective only depend agent s past experience symbol possibly generic background knowledge
MISC--: cost symbol shall small iff leads good mdp representation
MISC--: establishment criterion transforms general ill defined rl problem formal optimization problem minimizing cost efficient algorithms need developed
MISC--: another important question problems profitably reduced mdps citation
MISC--: real world does not conform itself nice models reality non ergodic partially observable uncertain unknown environment acquiring experience expensive
MISC--: so we should exploit data past experience at hand well possible cannot generate virtual samples since model not given need learned itself there no reset option
MISC--: no criterion this general setup exists
MISC--: course there previous work one another way related symbol mdp
MISC--: partly detailed later suggested symbol mdp model interesting connections many important ideas approaches rl beyond parskip ex parsep exsep ex symbol mdp side steps open problem learning pomdps citation unlike bayesian rl algorithms citation symbol mdp avoids learning complete stochastic observation model symbol mdp scaled down practical instantiation aixi citation symbol mdp extends idea state aggregation planning based bi simulation metrics citation rl based information symbol mdp generalizes u tree citation arbitrary features symbol mdp extends model selection criteria general rl problems citation symbol mdp alternative psrs citation proper learning algorithms yet developed symbol mdp extends feature selection supervised learning rl citation
MISC--: learning agents via rewards much more demanding task than classical machine learning independently identically distributed iid data largely due temporal credit assignment exploration problem
MISC--: nevertheless rl closely related adaptive control theory engineering been applied often unrivaled variety real world problems occasionally stunning success backgammon checkers citation helicopter control citation
MISC--: symbol mdp overcomes several limitations approaches items above thus broadens applicability rl
MISC--: symbol mdp owes its general purpose learning planning ability its information complexity theoretical foundations
MISC--: implementation symbol mdp based specialized general search optimization algorithms used finding good reductions symbol
MISC--: given symbol mdp aims at general ai problems one may wonder about role other aspects traditionally considered ai citation knowledge representation kr logic may useful representing complex reductions symbol
MISC--: agent interface fields like robotics computer vision natural language processing speedup learning pre post processing raw observations actions into more structured formats
AIMX--: representational interface aspects will only barely discussed this paper
OWNX--: following diagram illustrates symbol mdp perspective end center section formalizes our symbol mdp setup consists agent model map symbol observation reward action histories mdp states
OWNX--: section develops our core symbol selection principle illustrated section tiny example
OWNX--: section discusses general search algorithms finding approximations optimal symbol concretized context tree mdps
OWNX--: section i find optimal action symbol mdp present overall algorithm
OWNX--: section improves symbol selection criterion integrating out states
MISC--: section contains brief discussion symbol mdp including relations prior work incremental algorithms outlook more realistic structured mdps dynamic bayesian networks symbol dbn treated part ii
MISC--: rather than leaving parts symbol mdp vague unspecified i decided give at very least simplistic concrete algorithm each building block may assembled one sound system one build
MISC--: throughout this article symbol denotes binary logarithm symbol empty string symbol if symbol symbol else kronecker symbol
MISC--: i generally omit separating commas if no confusion arises particular indices
MISC--: any symbol suitable type string vector set i define string symbol sum symbol union symbol vector symbol where symbol ranges over full range symbol symbol length dimension size symbol
MISC--: symbol denotes estimate symbol
MISC--: symbol denotes probability over states rewards parts thereof
MISC--: i do not distinguish between random variables symbol realizations symbol abbreviation symbol never leads confusion
CONT--: more specifically symbol denotes number states symbol any state index symbol current time symbol any time history
CONT--: further order not get distracted at several places i gloss over initial conditions special cases where inessential
MISC--: also symbol undefined symbol infinity
