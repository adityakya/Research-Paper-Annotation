MISC--: wide variety regularization methods algorithms computing entire solution path been developed recently
MISC--: solution path algorithms do not only compute solution one particular value regularization parameter but entire path solutions making selection optimal parameter much easier
MISC--: most currently used algorithms not robust sense they cannot deal general degenerate input
OWNX--: here we present new robust generic method parametric quadratic programming
MISC--: our algorithm directly applies nearly all machine learning applications where so far every application required its own different algorithm
OWNX--: we illustrate usefulness our method applying very low rank problem could not solved existing path tracking methods namely compute part worth values choice based conjoint analysis popular technique market research estimate consumers preferences class parameterized options
OWNX--: we study combinatorial algorithm solve parameterized quadratic programs i e compute whole solution path
CONT--: unlike other methods employed machine learning our algorithm deal singular objective function matrices without perturbing input
MISC--: regularization methods resulting parametrized quadratic programs successfully been applied many optimization classification regression tasks variety areas example signal processing statistics biology surface reconstruction information retrieval
AIMX--: we will briefly review some applications here we will also study another application namely choice based conjoint analysis more detail
MISC--: conjoint analysis comprises popular family techniques mostly used market research assess consumers preferences set options specified multiple parameters see citation overview recent developments
OWNX--: we will show regularization approach analysis preference data leads parameterized quadratic program sparse low rank positive semi definite matrix describing quadratic term objective function
