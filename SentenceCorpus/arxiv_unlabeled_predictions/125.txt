OWNX--: we identify classical perceptron algorithm margin member broader family large margin classifiers we collectively call margitron
MISC--: margitron despite its sharing same update rule perceptron shown incremental setting converge finite number updates solutions possessing any desirable fraction maximum margin
OWNX--: experiments comparing margitron decomposition svms tasks involving linear kernels norm soft margin also reported
MISC--: widely accepted larger margin solution hyperplane greater generalisation ability learning machine citation
CONT--: simplest online learning algorithm binary linear classification perceptron citation does not aim at any margin
OWNX--: problem instead finding optimal margin hyperplane lies at core support vector machines svms citation
MISC--: their efficient implementation however somewhat hindered fact they require solving quadratic programming problem
MISC--: complications encountered implementing svms respurred interest alternative large margin classifiers many based perceptron algorithm
MISC--: oldest algorithm appeared long before advent svms standard perceptron margin citation straightforward extension perceptron however incremental setting known able guarantee achieving only up symbol maximum margin dataset possesses citation
MISC--: subsequently various algorithms succeeded achieving larger fractions maximum margin employing modified perceptron like update rules
MISC--: algorithms include romma citation alma citation cramma citation micra citation
MISC--: somewhat different approach hard margin one adopted most algorithms above was also developed focuses minimisation norm soft margin loss through stochastic gradient descent
MISC--: there connection however between algorithms perceptron since their unregularised form constant learning rate identical perceptron margin
MISC--: notable representatives this approach pioneer norma citation very recent pegasos citation
AIMX--: question arises naturally we attempt answer present work whether possible achieve guaranteed fraction maximum margin larger than symbol while retaining original perceptron update rule
OWNX--: this end we construct whole new family algorithms at least one member guaranteed convergence finite number steps solution hyperplane possessing any desirable fraction unknown maximum margin
MISC--: this family algorithms classical perceptron margin naturally embedded will termed margitron
MISC--: hopefully algorithms belonging margitron family virtue being generalisations very successful perceptron will respectable performance various classification tasks
OWNX--: section contains some preliminaries description margitron algorithm
OWNX--: section devoted theoretical analysis
OWNX--: section contains our experimental results while section our conclusions
