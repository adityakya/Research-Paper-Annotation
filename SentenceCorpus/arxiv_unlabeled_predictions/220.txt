OWNX--: we study regret optimal strategies online convex optimization games
BASE--: using von neumann s minimax theorem we show optimal regret this adversarial setting closely related behavior empirical minimization algorithm stochastic process setting equal maximum over joint distributions adversary s action sequence difference between sum minimal expected losses minimal empirical loss
OWNX--: we show optimal regret natural geometric interpretation since viewed gap jensen s inequality concave functional minimizer over player s actions expected loss defined set probability distributions
OWNX--: we use this expression obtain upper lower bounds regret optimal strategy variety online learning problems
OWNX--: our method provides upper bounds without need construct learning algorithm lower bounds provide explicit optimal strategies adversary
MISC--: within theory learning two particular topics gained significant popularity over past years statistical learning online adversarial learning
OWNX--: papers former typically study generalization bounds convergence rates complexity measures function classes all under assumption examples drawn typically iid
MISC--: manner some underlying distribution
CONT--: working under assumption statistical learning finds its roots statistics probability theory high dimensional geometry one argue main questions now relatively well understood
MISC--: online learning while having its origins early s recently became popular area research once again
OWNX--: one might argue assumptions lack thereof make online learning attractive
OWNX--: indeed often assumed observed data generated maliciously rather than being drawn some fixed distribution
MISC--: moreover contrast batch learning flavor statistical learning sequential nature online problem lets adversary change its strategy middle interaction
MISC--: no surprise this adversarial learning seems quite bit more difficult than its statistical cousin
MISC--: worst case adversarial analysis does provide realistic modeling learning scenarios network security applications email spam detection network routing etc largely responsible renewed interest this area
MISC--: upon review central results adversarial online learning most found recent book cesa bianchi lugosi citation one cannot help but notice frequent similarities between guarantees performance online algorithms analogous guarantees under stochastic assumptions
MISC--: however discerning explicit link remained elusive
MISC--: vovk citation notices this phenomenon some important problems adversarial bounds line competitive learning theory only tiny amount worse than average case bounds some stochastic strategies nature
AIMX--: this paper we attempt build bridge between adversarial online learning statistical learning
OWNX--: using von neumann s minimax theorem we show optimal regret algorithm online convex optimization exactly difference between sum minimal expected losses minimal empirical loss under adversarial choice stochastic process generating data
OWNX--: this leads upper lower bounds optimal regret exhibit several similarities results statistical learning
MISC--: online convex optimization game proceeds rounds
MISC--: at each symbol rounds player learner predicts vector some convex set adversary responds convex function determines player s loss at chosen point
OWNX--: order emphasize relationship stochastic setting we denote player s choice symbol adversary s choice symbol
MISC--: note this differs instance notation citation
MISC--: suppose symbol convex compact class functions constitutes set player s choices
