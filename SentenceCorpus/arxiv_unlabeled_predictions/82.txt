OWNX--: purpose this note show how method maximum entropy mean mem may used improve parametric estimation when measurements corrupted large level noise
OWNX--: method developed context concrete example estimation parameter exponential distribution
OWNX--: we compare performance our method bayesian maximum likelihood approaches
CONT--: suppose you want measure half life decaying nucleus life time some elementary particle some other random variable modeled exponential distribution describing say decay time life time process
MISC--: assume well noise measurement process modeled centered gaussian random variable whose variance may same order magnitude decay rate measured
MISC--: make things worse assume you only collect very few measurements
MISC--: if symbol denotes realized value variable one only measure symbol symbol where symbol small mumbler say symbol symbol symbol denotes additive measurement noise
MISC--: other words assume you know sample comes specific parametric distribution but contaminated additive noise
MISC--: what do
OWNX--: one possible approach apply small sample statistical estimation procedures
OWNX--: but designed problems where variability due only random nature quantity measured there no other noise measurement still another possibility one we explore here apply maxentropic filtering method estimate both unknown variable noise level
OWNX--: this we recast problem typical inverse problem consisting solving symbol symbol where symbol convex set symbol symbol some symbol symbol symbol symbol matrix depends how we rephrase our problem
OWNX--: we could example consider following problem find symbol symbol our case symbol we set symbol we could consider collection symbol problems one every measurement then proceed carry estimation
OWNX--: once we solved generic problem variations theme easy write down
OWNX--: what important keep mind here output method filtered estimator symbol symbol itself estimator unknown parameter
MISC--: novelty then filter out noise
MISC--: method maximum entropy mean rather well suited solving problems like
MISC--: see navaza early development dacunha castele camboa full mathematical treatment
OWNX--: below we shall briefly review what method about then apply obtain estimator symbol
OWNX--: section obtain maxentropic estimator section we examine some its properties particular we examine what results would if either noise level were small number measurements were large
OWNX--: we devote section some simulations method compared bayesian maximum likelihood approaches
