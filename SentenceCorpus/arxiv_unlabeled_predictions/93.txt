MISC--: building rules top ontologies ultimate goal logical layer semantic web
OWNX--: this aim ad hoc mark up language this layer currently under discussion
MISC--: intended follow tradition hybrid knowledge representation reasoning systems symbol log integrates description logic symbol function free horn clausal language textsc datalog
AIMX--: this paper we consider problem automating acquisition rules semantic web
OWNX--: we propose general framework rule induction adopts methodological apparatus inductive logic programming relies expressive deductive power symbol log
MISC--: framework valid whatever scope induction description vs prediction
OWNX--: yet illustrative purposes we also discuss instantiation framework aims at description turns out useful ontology refinement
MISC--: during last decade increasing attention been paid ontologies their role knowledge engineering citation
MISC--: philosophical sense we may refer ontology particular system categories accounting certain vision world
OWNX--: this system does not depend particular language aristotle s ontology always same independently language used describe
MISC--: other hand its most prevalent use artificial intelligence ontology refers engineering artifact more precisely produced according principles ontological engineering citation constituted specific vocabulary used describe certain reality plus set explicit assumptions regarding intended meaning vocabulary words
MISC--: this set assumptions usually form first order logical theory where vocabulary words appear unary binary predicate names respectively called concepts relations
MISC--: simplest case ontology describes hierarchy concepts related subsumption relationships more sophisticated cases suitable axioms added order express other relationships between concepts constrain their intended interpretation
OWNX--: two readings ontology described above indeed related each other but order solve terminological impasse word conceptualization used refer philosophical reading appear following definition based citation ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization domain interest
MISC--: among other things this definition emphasizes fact ontology specified language comes formal semantics
CONT--: only using formal approach ontologies provide machine interpretable meaning concepts relations expected when using ontology based approach
MISC--: among formalisms proposed ontological engineering most currently used description logics dls citation
MISC--: note dls decidable fragments first order logic fol incomparable horn clausal logic hcl regards expressive power citation semantics citation ontology engineering notably its dl based approach playing relevant role definition semantic web
MISC--: semantic web vision world wide web enriched machine processable information supports user his tasks citation
MISC--: architecture semantic web shown figure
MISC--: consists several layers each equipped ad hoc mark up language
MISC--: particular design mark up language ontological layer owl been based very expressive dl symbol citation
MISC--: whereas owl already undergoing standardization process at w c debate around unified language rules still ongoing
MISC--: proposals like swrl extend owl constructs inspired horn clauses order meet primary requirement logical layer build rules top ontologies
MISC--: swrl intended bridge notorious gaps between dls hcl way similar spirit hybridization knowledge representation reasoning kr r systems symbol log citation
MISC--: generally speaking hybrid systems kr r systems constituted two more subsystems dealing distinct portions single knowledge base performing specific reasoning procedures citation
MISC--: motivation investigating developing systems improve two basic features kr r formalisms namely representational adequacy deductive power preserving other crucial feature i e decidability
MISC--: particular combining dls hcl easily yield undecidability if interface between them not reduced citation
MISC--: hybrid system symbol log integrates symbol citation textsc datalog citation using symbol concept assertions essentially type constraints variables
MISC--: been very recently mentioned blueprint well founded semantic web rule mark up languages because its underlying form integration called safe assures semantic computational advantages swrl though more expressive than symbol log currently not assure citation
MISC--: defining rules including ones semantic web been usually considered demanding task viewpoint knowledge engineering
MISC--: often supported machine learning algorithms vary approaches
MISC--: approach known under name inductive logic programming ilp seems promising case at hand due common roots logic programming citation
MISC--: ilp been historically concerned rule induction examples background knowledge within representation framework hcl aim prediction citation
MISC--: more recently ilp moved towards either different fol fragments e g dls new learning goals e g description
AIMX--: this paper we resort methodological apparatus ilp define general framework learning rules top ontologies semantic web within kr r framework symbol log
OWNX--: framework proposed general sense valid whatever scope induction description vs prediction
OWNX--: sake illustration we concentrate instantiation framework case description
AIMX--: paper organized follows
OWNX--: section introduces basic notions symbol log
OWNX--: section defines framework learning rules symbol log
OWNX--: section illustrates instantiation framework
OWNX--: section concludes paper final remarks
MISC--: clarifies links between owl dls
