MISC--: many reinforcement learning exploration techniques overly optimistic try explore every state
MISC--: exploration impossible environments unlimited number states
BASE--: i propose use simulated exploration optimistic model discover promising paths real exploration
OWNX--: this reduces needs real exploration
MISC--: reinforcement learning citation agent collects rewards environment
MISC--: environment not known advance
MISC--: agent explore learn where go
MISC--: reward could received when taking action state
MISC--: agent aims maximize her long term reward environment
MISC--: she should not miss any state important reward shorter path
MISC--: there many existing exploration techniques citation optimistic face uncertainty
MISC--: their optimism assumes greater reward will obtained when taking unknown action
MISC--: problem how do exploration environments unlimited number states
MISC--: environments not possible try every action every possible state
OWNX--: i study new way do exploration environments unlimited number states
OWNX--: i use simulated exploration incentive real exploration
MISC--: simulated exploration proposes promising paths explore
OWNX--: i describe how use this kind exploration section
OWNX--: my experiments section demonstrate how simulated exploration reduced needed amount real exploration
MISC--: i also discuss when possible
MISC--: many works touched related problems
OWNX--: they inspired me i discuss them section
