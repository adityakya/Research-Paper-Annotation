MISC--: recent years spectral clustering become one most popular modern clustering algorithms
MISC--: simple implement solved efficiently standard linear algebra software very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms k means algorithm
OWNX--: first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious not obvious see why works at all what really does
MISC--: goal this tutorial give some intuition those questions
MISC--: we describe different graph laplacians their basic properties present most common spectral clustering algorithms derive those algorithms scratch several different approaches
MISC--: advantages disadvantages different spectral clustering algorithms discussed
MISC--: clustering one most widely used techniques exploratory data analysis applications ranging statistics computer science biology social sciences psychology
MISC--: virtually every scientific field dealing empirical data people attempt get first impression their data trying identify groups similar behavior their data
OWNX--: this article we would like introduce reader family spectral clustering algorithms
MISC--: compared traditional algorithms symbol means single linkage spectral clustering many fundamental advantages
MISC--: results obtained spectral clustering often outperform traditional approaches spectral clustering very simple implement solved efficiently standard linear algebra methods this tutorial set up self contained introduction spectral clustering
AIMX--: we derive spectral clustering scratch present different points view why spectral clustering works
MISC--: apart basic linear algebra no particular mathematical background required reader
OWNX--: however we do not attempt give concise review whole literature spectral clustering impossible due overwhelming amount literature this subject
OWNX--: first two sections devoted step step introduction mathematical objects used spectral clustering similarity graphs section graph laplacians section
MISC--: spectral clustering algorithms themselves will presented section
MISC--: next three sections then devoted explaining why those algorithms work
OWNX--: each section corresponds one explanation section describes graph partitioning approach section random walk perspective section perturbation theory approach
OWNX--: section we will study some practical issues related spectral clustering discuss various extensions literature related spectral clustering section
