OWNX--: while regret bound theorem essentially optimal lipschitz mab problem symbol strikingly odd achieved simple algorithm
MISC--: particular algorithm approximates strategy set fixed mesh symbol does not refine this mesh gains information about location optimal strategy
MISC--: moreover metric contains seemingly useful proximity information but algorithm ignores this information after choosing its initial mesh
OWNX--: this really best algorithm
MISC--: closer examination lower bound proof raises further reasons suspicion based contrived highly singular payoff function symbol alternates between being constant some distance scales being very steep other much smaller distance scales create multi scale needle haystack phenomenon nearly obliterates usefulness proximity information contained metric symbol

OWNX--: our theorem stated below reveals similar phenomenon general metric spaces possible define algorithms whose regret outperforms per metric optimal algorithm when input instance sufficiently benign xhdr our results techniques this paper we consider lipschitz mab problem arbitrary metric spaces
OWNX--: we concerned following two main questions motivated discussion above i what best possible bound regret given metric space ii one take advantage benign payoff functions
AIMX--: this paper we give complete solution i describing every metric space symbol family algorithms come arbitrarily close achieving best possible regret bound symbol
OWNX--: we also give satisfactory answer ii our solution arbitrarily close optimal terms zooming dimension defined below

OWNX--: moreover we show zooming algorithm perform significantly better benign problem instances
OWNX--: every instance symbol we define parameter called zooming dimension often significantly smaller than symbol we bound algorithm s performance terms zooming dimension problem instance
OWNX--: since zooming algorithm self tuning achieves this bound without requiring prior knowledge zooming dimension our main technical contribution new algorithm zooming algorithm combines upper confidence bound technique used earlier bandit algorithms textsc ucb novel adaptive refinement step uses past history zoom regions near apparent maxima symbol explore denser mesh strategies regions

OWNX--: state our theorem per metric optimal solution i we need sketch few definitions arise naturally one tries extend lower bound citation general metric spaces
MISC--: let us say subset symbol metric space symbol covering dimension symbol if covered symbol sets diameter symbol all symbol
MISC--: point symbol local covering dimension symbol if open neighborhood covering dimension symbol
MISC--: space symbol max min covering dimension symbol if no subspace whose local covering dimension uniformly bounded below number greater than symbol omit metric spaces highly homogeneous sense any two eps balls isometric one another theorem follows easily refinement techniques introduced citation particular upper bound achieved using generalization na i ve algorithm described earlier general symbol bounded above covering dimension symbol
OWNX--: metric spaces highly homogeneous sense any two eps balls isometric one another two dimensions equal upper bound theorem achieved using generalization na i ve algorithm described earlier
MISC--: difficulty theorem lies dealing inhomogeneities metric space
BASE--: important treat problem at this level generality because some most natural applications lipschitz mab problem eg web advertising problem described earlier based highly inhomogeneous metric spaces web taxonomies unreasonable expect different categories at same level topic hierarchy roughly same number descendants algorithm theorem combines zooming algorithm described earlier delicate transfinite construction over closed subsets consisting fat points whose local covering dimension exceeds given threshold symbol
OWNX--: lower bound we craft new dimensionality notion max min covering dimension introduced above captures inhomogeneity metric space we connect this notion transfinite construction underlies algorithm
OWNX--: benign input instances we provide better performance guarantee zooming algorithm
MISC--: lower bounds theorems based contrived highly singular needle haystack instances set near optimal strategies astronomically larger than set precisely optimal strategies
OWNX--: accordingly we quantify tractability problem instance terms number near optimal strategies
OWNX--: we define zooming dimension instance symbol smallest symbol following covering property holds every symbol we require only symbol sets diameter symbol cover set strategies whose payoff falls short maximum amount between symbol symbol
OWNX--: zooming dimension significantly smaller than max min covering dimension omit ve algorithm theorem performs poorly compared zooming algorithm let us illustrate this point two examples where simplicity max min covering dimension equal covering dimension omit first if symbol euclidean metric unit interval symbol twice differentiable function negative second derivative at optimal strategy symbol then zooming dimension only symbol whereas covering dimension symbol first example consider metric space consisting high dimensional part low dimensional part

MISC--: assign edge weights symbol exponentially decreasing distance root let symbol resulting shortest path metric leaf set symbol
MISC--: if there unique optimal strategy lies low dimensional part symbol then zooming dimension bounded above covering dimension symbol whereas global covering dimension symbol
OWNX--: second example let symbol homogeneous high dimensional metric eg euclidean metric unit symbol cube payoff function symbol some subset symbol
MISC--: then zooming dimension equal covering dimension symbol eg symbol if symbol finite point set

OWNX--: than local covering dimension at point symbol where symbol maximized xhdr discussion stating theorems above we been imprecise about specifying model computation
OWNX--: particular we ignored thorny issue how provide algorithm input containing metric space may infinite number points
AIMX--: simplest way interpret our theorems ignore implementation details interpret algorithm mean abstract decision rule i e possibly randomized function mapping history past observations symbol strategy symbol played current period
MISC--: all our theorems valid under this interpretation but they also made into precise algorithmic results provided algorithm given appropriate oracle access metric space
MISC--: most cases our algorithms require only covering oracle takes finite collection open balls either declares they cover symbol outputs uncovered point
OWNX--: we refer this setting standardmab
CONT--: example zooming algorithm uses only covering oracle symbol requires only one oracle query per round at most symbol balls round symbol
OWNX--: however per metric optimal algorithm theorem uses more complicated oracles we defer definition oracles section omit algorithm very efficient requiring only symbol operations total including oracle queries choose its first symbol strategies bobbynote prove symbol bound body while our definitions results so far been tailored lipschitz mab problem infinite metrics some them extended finite case well
OWNX--: particular zooming algorithm we obtain sharp results meaningful both finite infinite metrics using more precise non asymptotic version zooming dimension
OWNX--: extending notions theorem finite case open question omit while our definitions results so far been tailored lipschitz mab problem infinite metrics they extended finite case well
OWNX--: particular zooming algorithm we obtain sharp results meaningful both finite infinite metrics using more precise non asymptotic version zooming dimension
OWNX--: extending notions theorem finite case feasible but more complicated we leave full version xhdr extensions we provide number extensions we elaborate our analysis zooming algorithm
OWNX--: first we provide sharper bounds several examples reward playing each strategy symbol symbol plus independent noise known benign shape
OWNX--: second we upgrade zooming algorithm so satisfies guarantee theorem enjoys better guarantee if maximal reward exactly
OWNX--: third we apply this result version where symbol some target set symbol not revealed algorithm
CONT--: fourth we relax some assumptions analysis zooming algorithm use this generalization analyze version symbol some known function symbol
OWNX--: finally we extend our analysis reward distributions supported symbol those unbounded support finite absolute third moment omit some our initial motivation this project came online advertizing scenario described introduction
OWNX--: we follow this motivation further appendix consider multi round game each round adversary selects webpage algorithm selects ad places this webpage
OWNX--: we assume we lipschitz condition product webpages symbol ads space we give algorithm whose regret dimension defined section upper bounded terms essentially covering dimension
BASE--: although algorithm based na i ve algorithm theorem adversarial aspect problem creates considerable technical challenges
OWNX--: future work we hope pursue more refined guarantees style section omit ideally would desirable matching lower bound constituting per instance optimality guarantee zooming algorithm some other algorithm
MISC--: goal when stated this form plainly unachievable
MISC--: any given instance symbol if symbol point where symbol achieves its maximum then algorithm always plays strategy symbol zero regret
OWNX--: nevertheless one might hope subtler characterization per instance optimality eg asserting no algorithm outperform symbol one instance symbol without performing significantly worse than symbol highly similar instances symbol
AIMX--: while we been unable prove guarantees zooming algorithm question per instance optimality attractive topic further investigation xhdr follow up work metric spaces whose max min covering dimension exactly this paper provides upper bound symbol any symbol but no matching lower bound
MISC--: characterizing optimal regret metric spaces remained open question
CONT--: following publication conference version this question been settled citation revealing following dichotomy every metric space optimal regret lipschitz mab algorithm either bounded above any symbol bounded below any symbol depending whether completion metric space compact countable
