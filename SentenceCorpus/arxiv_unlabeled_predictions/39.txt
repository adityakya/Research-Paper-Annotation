MISC--: one property networks received comparatively little attention hierarchy ie property having vertices cluster together groups then join form groups groups so forth up through all levels organization network
AIMX--: here we give precise definition hierarchical structure give generic model generating arbitrary hierarchical structure random graph describe statistically principled way learn set hierarchical features most plausibly explain particular real world network
MISC--: applying this approach two example networks we demonstrate its advantages interpretation network data annotation graphs edge vertex community properties generation generic null models further hypothesis testing
MISC--: networks graphs provide useful mathematical representation broad variety complex systems world wide web internet social biochemical ecological systems
MISC--: last decade seen surge interest across sciences study networks including both empirical studies particular networked systems development new techniques models their analysis interpretation citation
MISC--: within mathematical sciences researchers focused statistical characterization network structure at times producing descriptive generative mechanisms simple structures
MISC--: this approach scientists focused statistical summaries network structure path lengths citation degree distributions citation correlation coefficients citation stands contrast example work networks social biological sciences where focus instead properties individual vertices groups
MISC--: more recently researchers both areas become more interested global organization networks citation
MISC--: one property real world networks received comparatively little attention hierarchy i e observation networks often fractal like structure vertices cluster together into groups then join form groups groups so forth lowest levels organization up level entire network
AIMX--: this paper we offer precise definition notion hierarchy networks give generic model generating networks arbitrary hierarchical structure
AIMX--: we then describe approach learning models real network data based maximum likelihood methods markov chain monte carlo sampling
OWNX--: addition inferring global structure graph data our method allows researcher annotate graph community structure edge strength vertex affiliation information
OWNX--: at its heart our method works sampling hierarchical structures probability proportional likelihood they produce input graph
MISC--: this allows us contemplate ensemble random graphs statistically similar original graph through measure various average network properties manner reminiscent bayesian model averaging
OWNX--: particular we search maximum likelihood hierarchical model particular graph then used null model further hypothesis testing derive consensus hierarchical structure ensemble sampled models where hierarchical features weighted their likelihood annotate edge absence edge surprising extent occurs low probability ensemble
MISC--: our knowledge this method only one offers information about network
MISC--: moreover this information easily represented human readable format providing compact visualization important organizational features network will useful tool practitioners generating new hypotheses about organization networks
