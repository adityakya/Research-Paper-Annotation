MISC--: explaining adaptive behavior central problem artificial intelligence research
BASE--: here we formalize adaptive agents mixture distributions over sequences inputs outputs i o
MISC--: each distribution mixture constitutes possible world but agent does not know possible worlds actually facing
MISC--: problem adapt i o stream way compatible true world
MISC--: natural measure adaptation obtained kullback leibler kl divergence between i o distribution true world i o distribution expected agent uncertain about possible worlds
OWNX--: case pure input streams bayesian mixture provides well known solution this problem
OWNX--: we show however case i o streams this solution breaks down because outputs issued agent itself require different probabilistic syntax provided intervention calculus
BASE--: based this calculus we obtain bayesian control rule allows modeling adaptive behavior mixture distributions over i o streams
OWNX--: this rule might allow novel approach adaptive control based minimum kl principle
MISC--: ability adapt unknown environments often considered hallmark intelligence citation
MISC--: agent environment conceptualized two systems exchange symbols every time step citation symbol issued agent action whereas symbol issued environment observation
MISC--: thus both agent environment conceptualized probability distributions over sequences actions observations i o streams
MISC--: if environment perfectly known then i o probability distribution agent tailored suit this particular environment
MISC--: however if environment unknown but known belong set possible environments then agent faces adaptation problem
MISC--: consider example robot been endowed set behavioral primitives now faces problem how act while being ignorant correct primitive
OWNX--: since we want model both agent environment probability distributions over i o sequences natural way measure degree adaptation would measure distance probability space between i o distribution represented agent i o distribution conditioned true environment
MISC--: suitable measure terms its information theoretic interpretation readily provided kl divergence citation
OWNX--: case passive prediction adaptation problem well known solution
MISC--: distribution minimizes kl divergence bayesian mixture distribution over all possible environments citation
AIMX--: aim this paper extend this result distributions over both inputs outputs
AIMX--: main result this paper this extension only possible if we consider special syntax actions probability theory been suggested proponents causal calculus citation
