MISC--: many databases store data relational format different types entities information about links between entities
MISC--: field statistical relational learning srl developed number new statistical models data
OWNX--: this paper we focus learning class level first order dependencies model general database statistics over attributes linked objects links e g percentage grades given computer science classes
MISC--: class level statistical relationships important themselves they support applications like policy making strategic planning query optimization
MISC--: most current srl methods find class level dependencies but their main task support instance level predictions about attributes links specific entities
OWNX--: we focus only class level prediction describe algorithms learning class level models orders magnitude faster this task
MISC--: our algorithms learn bayes nets relational structure leveraging efficiency single table nonrelational bayes net learners
MISC--: evaluation our methods three data sets shows they computationally feasible realistic table sizes learned structures represent statistical information databases well
MISC--: after learning compiles database statistics into bayes net querying statistics via bayes net inference faster than sql queries does not depend size database
MISC--: many real world applications store data relational format different tables entities their links
MISC--: standard machine learning techniques applied data stored single table nonrelational propositional flat format citation
MISC--: field statistical relational learning srl aims extend machine learning algorithms relational data citation
MISC--: one major machine learning tasks use data build generative statistical model variables application domain citation
MISC--: single table learning setting goal often represent predictive dependencies between attributes single individual e g between intelligence ranking student
MISC--: srl setting goal often represent addition dependencies between attributes different individuals related linked each other e g between intelligence student difficulty course given student registered course
