MISC--: detecting outliers grossly different inconsistent remaining dataset major challenge real world kdd applications
MISC--: existing outlier detection methods ineffective scattered real world datasets due implicit data patterns parameter setting issues
OWNX--: we define novel local distance based outlier factor ldof measure outlier ness objects scattered datasets addresses issues
MISC--: ldof uses relative location object its neighbours determine degree object deviates its neighbourhood
MISC--: properties ldof theoretically analysed including ldof s lower bound its false detection probability well parameter settings
OWNX--: order facilitate parameter settings real world applications we employ top symbol technique our outlier detection approach where only objects highest ldof values regarded outliers
OWNX--: compared conventional approaches top symbol knn top symbol lof our method top symbol ldof more effective at detecting outliers scattered data
OWNX--: also easier set parameters since its performance relatively stable over large range parameter values illustrated experimental results both real world synthetic datasets
OWNX--: all data mining techniques vogue outlier detection comes closest metaphor mining nuggets information real world data
MISC--: concerned discovering exceptional behavior certain objects citation
MISC--: outlier detection techniques widely been applied medicine e g adverse reactions analysis finance e g financial fraud detection security e g counter terrorism information security e g intrusions detection so
MISC--: recent decades many outlier detection approaches been proposed broadly classified into several categories distribution based citation depth based citation distance based e g knn citation cluster based e g dbscan citation density based e g lof citation methods
MISC--: however methods often unsuitable real world applications due number reasons
MISC--: firstly real world data usually scattered distribution where objects loosely distributed domain feature space
MISC--: local point view objects cannot represent explicit patterns e g clusters indicate normal data behavior
MISC--: however global point view scattered objects constitute several mini clusters represent pattern subset objects
OWNX--: only objects do not belong any other object groups genuine outliers
MISC--: unfortunately existing outlier definitions depend assumption most objects crowded few main clusters
MISC--: they incapable dealing scattered datasets because mini clusters dataset evoke high false detection rate low precision
MISC--: secondly difficult current outlier detection approaches set accurate parameters real world datasets
MISC--: most outlier algorithms must tuned through trial error citation
OWNX--: this impractical because real world data usually do not contain labels anomalous objects
OWNX--: addition hard evaluate detection performance without confirmation domain experts
MISC--: therefore detection result will uncontrollable if parameters not properly chosen
MISC--: alleviate parameter setting problem researchers proposed top symbol style outlier detection methods
OWNX--: instead binary outlier indicator top symbol outlier methods provide ranked list objects represent degree outlier ness each object
MISC--: users domain experts re examine selected top symbol where symbol typically far smaller than cardinality dataset anomalous objects locate real outliers
OWNX--: since this detection procedure provide good interaction between data mining experts users top symbol outlier detection methods become popular real world applications
MISC--: distance based top symbol symbol nearest neighbour distance citation typical top symbol style outlier detection approach
OWNX--: order distinguish original distance based outlier detection method citation we denote symbol nearest neighbour distance outlier top symbol knn this paper
OWNX--: top symbol knn outlier distance object its symbol nearest neighbour denoted symbol distance short indicates outlier ness object
OWNX--: intuitively larger symbol distance higher outlier ness object top symbol knn outlier regards symbol objects highest values symbol distance outliers citation
MISC--: density based outlier local outlier factor lof citation was proposed same year top symbol knn
MISC--: lof outlier factor assigned each object w r t its surrounding neighbourhood
MISC--: outlier factor depends how data object closely packed its locally reachable neighbourhood citation
MISC--: since lof uses threshold differentiate outliers normal objects citation same problem parameter setting arises
OWNX--: lower outlier ness threshold will produce high false detection rate while high threshold value will result missing genuine outliers
MISC--: recent real world applications researchers found more reliable use lof top symbol manner citation i e only objects highest lof values will considered outliers
OWNX--: hereafter we call top symbol lof
MISC--: besides top symbol knn top symbol lof researchers proposed other methods deal real world data connectivity based cof citation resolution cluster based rb outlier citation
AIMX--: although existing top symbol style outlier detection techniques alleviate difficulty parameter setting detection precision methods this paper we take top symbol knn top symbol lof typical examples low scattered data
OWNX--: section we will discuss further problems top symbol knn top symbol lof
AIMX--: this paper we propose new outlier detection definition named local distance based outlier factor ldof sensitive outliers scattered datasets
MISC--: ldof uses relative distance object its neighbours measure how much objects deviate their scattered neighbourhood
OWNX--: higher violation degree object more likely object outlier
OWNX--: addition we theoretically analyse properties ldof including its lower bound false detection probability provide guidelines choosing suitable neighbourhood size
OWNX--: order simplify parameter setting real world applications top symbol technique employed our approach
OWNX--: validate ldof we perform various experiments both synthetic real world datasets compare our outlier detection performance top symbol knn top symbol lof
