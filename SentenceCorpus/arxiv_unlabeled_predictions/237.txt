MISC--: information distance parameter free similarity measure based compression used pattern recognition data mining phylogeny clustering classification
MISC--: notion information distance extended pairs multiples finite lists
OWNX--: we study maximal overlap metricity universality minimal overlap additivity normalized information distance multiples
OWNX--: we use theoretical notion kolmogorov complexity practical purposes approximated length compressed version file involved using real world compression program
MISC--: pattern recognition learning data mining one obtains information objects containing information
OWNX--: this involves objective definition information single object information go one object another object pair objects information go one object any other object multiple objects shared information between objects citation
MISC--: classical notion kolmogorov complexity citation objective measure information single object information distance measures information between pair objects citation
MISC--: this last notion spawned research theoretical direction among others citation
MISC--: research practical direction focused normalized information distance similarity metric arises normalizing information distance proper manner approximating kolmogorov complexity through real world compressors citation this normalized information distance parameter free feature free alignment free similarity measure had great impact applications
OWNX--: variant this compression distance been tested all time sequence databases used last decade major data mining conferences sigkdd sigmod icdm icde ssdb vldb pkdd pakdd citation
OWNX--: conclusion method competitive all other methods used superior heterogenous data clustering anomaly detection
MISC--: citation was shown method resistant noise
MISC--: this theory found many applications pattern recognition phylogeny clustering classification
MISC--: objects represented computer files applications range weather forecasting software earthquake prediction music literature ocr bioinformatics internet citation
MISC--: objects only represented name objects abstract like red einstein three normalized information distance uses background information provided google any search engine produces aggregate page counts
MISC--: discovers meaning words phrases sense producing relative semantics
MISC--: applications run ontology semantics tourism web taxonomy multilingual questions question answer systems citation
MISC--: more references either subject see textbook citation google scholar references citation
OWNX--: however many applications we interested shared information between many objects instead just pair objects
MISC--: example customer reviews gadgets blogs about public happenings newspaper articles about same occurrence we interested most comprehensive one most specialized one
OWNX--: thus we want extend information distance measure pairs multiples
