MISC--: cooperative decision making vision future network management control
MISC--: distributed connection preemption important example where nodes make intelligent decisions allocating resources controlling traffic flows multi class service networks
MISC--: challenge nodal decisions spatially dependent traffic flows trespass multiple nodes network
MISC--: hence performance complexity trade off becomes important ie how accurate decisions versus how much information exchanged among nodes
MISC--: connection preemption known np complete
MISC--: centralized preemption optimal but computationally intractable
MISC--: decentralized preemption computationally efficient but may result poor performance
MISC--: this work investigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether flows preempt using only local information exchange neighbors
BASE--: this work we first model large number distributed preemption decisions using probabilistic graphical model
OWNX--: we then define near optimality distributed preemption its approximation optimal centralized preemption within given error bound
OWNX--: we show sufficient condition distributed preemption optimal local decisions should constitute markov random field
MISC--: decision variables however do not possess exact spatial markov dependence reality due flows passing through multiple links
OWNX--: hence we study traffic patterns flows derive sufficient conditions flows distributed preemption near optimal
OWNX--: we develop based probabilistic graphical models near optimal distributed algorithm
OWNX--: algorithm used each node make collectively near optimal preemption decisions
OWNX--: we study trade offs between near optimal performance complexity corresponds amount information exchange distributed algorithm
MISC--: algorithm validated both analysis simulation
MISC--: vision future network management involve nodes make intelligent decisions allocating resources controlling traffic flows
MISC--: this includes admitting new flows preempting less important existing flows well studied policy based admission control i e admission based priority flows citation citation
MISC--: specifically preemption defined at prioritized multi class network where new call needs set up high priority between source s destination d citation citation citation citation citation
MISC--: when capacity insufficient at all feasible routes between source destination s d pair some existing flows lower priorities need forced reduce their bandwidth move lowest service class e g best effort service simply preempted accommodate new call
MISC--: preemption decisions decide lower priority flows remove free reserved bandwidth new call at chosen route citation citation
OWNX--: goal decide whether preempt active flow so total preempted bandwidth minimal under constraints bandwidth demand new call available free bandwidth at each link benefit preemption been described prior works
MISC--: example preemption allows new high priority connection access heavily crowded core networks eg multi protocol label switched mpls networks citation
MISC--: connection preemption also improves resource utilization allowing low priority flows access unused bandwidths citation citation
MISC--: preemption sees potential applications emerging networks
MISC--: example e wireless lan delay sensitive ip packets expedited forwarding ef class served earlier than best effort packets through preemption citation
MISC--: multi level preemption precedence mlpp proposed classify calls their importance used military well commercial networks citation there two significant challenges preemption performance complexity
MISC--: performance corresponds whether right flows preempted result minimal bandwidth accommodate new flow
MISC--: complexity corresponds amount information needed preemption decision
MISC--: preemption known np complete citation
MISC--: complexity results large number active flows supported core network preemption decisions need made
MISC--: example gbps link if bandwidth each flow order kbps there would thousands flows supported per link
MISC--: addition flow generally passes through multiple nodes making preemption decisions among nodes dependent thus difficult done local information
MISC--: thus preemption network centric may require huge amount information perform large network centralized preemption decisions centralized node maintains routed path information active flows their priorities bandwidth occupancies at entire route
MISC--: centralized node then decides active flows preempt upon request new call
MISC--: therefore centralized preemption always optimal resulting minimal preempted bandwidth
MISC--: but amount management information needed overwhelming at centralized node
MISC--: example let symbol total number distinct flows per priority class at route new call
MISC--: each flow two states preempted not preempted
MISC--: total number possible states symbol making centralized decision
MISC--: when symbol order hundreds thousands citation centralized preemption becomes computationally intractable
MISC--: decentralized preemption then adopted reducing amount management information citation decentralized preemption done at each node individually thus requires node maintain its local information i e active flows at adjacent links their priorities bandwidth occupancy
MISC--: information available locally at nodes
OWNX--: node then decides independently other nodes connections preempt
MISC--: this however may cause conflicting local decisions same flows pass multiple links route resulting more preempted bandwidth than necessary
MISC--: other words decentralized preemption decision neglects spatial dependence flows across multiple links may perform poorly
MISC--: but amount management information greatly reduced compared centralized preemption
MISC--: example let symbol maximum number active flows per link
MISC--: total number states symbol at each link
MISC--: since symbol symbol symbol compared centralized preemption decentralized schemes much smaller search space preemption decisions
MISC--: therefore most algorithms literature focus decentralized preemption see citation citation references there this work studies distributed decisions take into account spatial dependence among neighboring links through local information exchange
MISC--: fact distributed preemption considered generalization centralized decentralized preemption
MISC--: centralized preemption corresponds one extreme case distributed preemption entire route neighborhood information exchange whereas decentralized decisions correspond another extreme case where neighborhood size zero
MISC--: therefore communication complexity characterized terms neighborhood size
MISC--: there trade off between optimality complexity general been shown difficult problem develop distributed algorithm whose performance predictable within tolerable degradation i e given error bound optimal scheme citation
MISC--: hence open issues when distributed decisions collectively result near optimal global preemption b how model large number dependent decision variables obtain near optimal local decisions using distributed algorithms
AIMX--: we apply machine learning study issues machine learning perspective machine learning view distributed preemption individual nodes learn make decisions collectively iteratively
MISC--: ideally if each node complete information all active flows at route new flow node will able make correct decisions flows preempt
CONT--: however at any given time node only partial information active flows route its neighbors decisions flows preempt
MISC--: but node adapt i e learn make decisions based those its neighbors
MISC--: neighbors learn neighbors neighbors node would indirectly learn what farther nodes decide only delay
OWNX--: eventually all nodes would make local decisions collectively resulting near optimal preemption at entire route how would machine learning benefit distributed preemption
MISC--: problem collective learning decision making been keen interest machine learning adaptive control citation citation but just begun see applications networking
MISC--: particular citation proposes using markov random fields general model decision making ad hoc wireless networks
MISC--: model then applied routing wireless networks
MISC--: our prior work citation citation obtain probabilistic graphical models ad hoc wireless wireline networks starting network properties citation citation resulting probabilistic models turn out multi layer
MISC--: this work focuses distributed decisions network flows
MISC--: we view machine learning framework large number decision variables treated jointly
MISC--: spatial dependence among variables poses key challenge preemption origin high communication complexity not been dealt sufficiently prior works
AIMX--: machine learning provides feasible approaches this problem summarized below global model distributed preemption decisions we first develop probabilistic model represents explicitly spatial dependence distributed preemption decisions over pre determined preempting route new flow
MISC--: randomness results randomly arriving departing active flows their locations
MISC--: preemption decisions made flows at each node also random due incomplete inaccurate local information distributed preemption
OWNX--: we first obtain cost function preemption hamiltonian system potential energy citation
MISC--: hamiltonian combines local preemption decisions constraints into single quantity
OWNX--: constraints include link capacity unused bandwidths bandwidth demand new flow at each link
MISC--: hamiltonian then used obtain spatial probabilistic model gibbs distribution citation b markov random field mrf sufficient conditions spatial dependence characterized through probabilistic dependency graph graphical models citation citation citation machine learning
MISC--: probabilistic dependency graph provides simple yet explicit representation spatial dependence among random variables
OWNX--: we show if dependence decision variables spatially markovian globally optimal preemption decision obtained collectively iterative local decisions through information exchange only neighboring nodes
MISC--: probabilistic model known markov random field citation
MISC--: general distributed decisions may not spatially markov since spatial dependence caused flows across multiple links
OWNX--: hence we identify traffic patterns active flows result approximately spatial markov dependence
OWNX--: we then define near optimality distributed decisions difference between centralized distributed decisions measured hamiltonian obtain sufficient conditions difference reside within error bound c distributed decision algorithm near optimal distributed algorithm derived based markov random field
MISC--: algorithms implemented through either message passing citation gibbs sampling citation d trade offs challenging issue performance complexity trade off i e when how distributed preemption achieve near optimal performance moderate complexity
MISC--: here performance measures optimality distributed preemption decision relative centralized optimal decision
MISC--: communication complexity distributed preemption characterized amount information used distributed decision making
MISC--: distributed decisions reduce complexity using information exchange only neighbors but may deviate optimal performance
