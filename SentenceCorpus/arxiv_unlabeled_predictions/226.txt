MISC--: inferring sequence states observations one most fundamental problems hidden markov models
MISC--: statistical physics language this problem equivalent computing marginals one dimensional model random external field
MISC--: while this task accomplished through transfer matrix methods becomes quickly intractable when underlying state space large

MISC--: hidden markov models hmm s workhorse modern statistics machine learning applications ranging speech recognition biological sequence alignment pattern classification citation
BASE--: hmm defines joint distribution over sequence states symbol symbol observations symbol whereby states form markov chain observations conditionally independent given sequence states
AIMX--: formulae we symbol most fundamental algorithmic task related hmm s arguably problem inferring sequence states symbol observations

MISC--: statistical physics point view citation conditional distribution regarded boltzmann distribution one dimensional system variables symbol energy function symbol at temperature symbol
MISC--: sequence observations thus act quenched external field
OWNX--: suggested this analogy marginals symbol computed efficiently using transfer matrix algorithm

MISC--: while this easy simple models few states becomes intractable complex models
OWNX--: simple mechanism leading state space explosion presence memory underlying markov chain dependence each observation multiple states
OWNX--: all cases model reduced standard hmm via state space augmentation but augmented state space becomes exponential memory length
