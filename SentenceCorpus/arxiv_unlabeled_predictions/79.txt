MISC--: solomonoff s central result induction prediction universal semimeasure symbol converges rapidly probability true sequence generating predictor symbol if latter computable
MISC--: hence symbol eligible universal sequence predictor case unknown symbol
OWNX--: despite some nearby results proofs literature stronger result convergence all martin l o f random sequences remained open
MISC--: convergence result would particularly interesting natural since randomness defined terms symbol itself
OWNX--: we show there universal semimeasures symbol do not converge symbol all symbol random sequences ie we give partial negative answer open problem
OWNX--: we also provide positive answer some non universal semimeasures
OWNX--: we define incomputable measure symbol mixture over all computable measures enumerable semimeasure symbol mixture over all enumerable nearly measures
OWNX--: we show symbol converges symbol symbol symbol all random sequences
MISC--: hellinger distance measuring closeness two distributions plays central role
MISC--: sequence prediction task defined predict next symbol symbol observed sequence symbol
MISC--: key concept attack general prediction problems occam s razor less extent epicurus principle multiple explanations
CONT--: former latter may interpreted keep simplest all theories consistent observations symbol use theories predict symbol
OWNX--: solomonoff citation formalized combined both principles his universal priori semimeasure symbol assigns high low probability simple complex environments symbol hence implementing occam epicurus
OWNX--: formally represented mixture all enumerable semimeasures
MISC--: abstract characterization symbol levin citation symbol universal enumerable semimeasure sense multiplicatively dominates all enumerable semimeasures
MISC--: solomonoff s citation central result if probability symbol observing symbol at time symbol given past observations symbol computable function then universal predictor symbol converges rapidly symbol probability w p symbol optimal true informed predictor symbol hence symbol represents universal predictor case unknown true distribution symbol

MISC--: says nothing about whether convergence true any particular sequence measure
MISC--: martin l o f m l randomness standard notion randomness individual sequences citation
OWNX--: m l random sequence passes all thinkable effective randomness tests eg law large numbers law iterated logarithm etc
OWNX--: particular set all symbol random sequences symbol measure
OWNX--: natural ask whether symbol converges symbol difference ratio individually all m l random sequences
MISC--: clearly solomonoff s result shows convergence may at most fail set sequences symbol measure zero
MISC--: convergence result m l random sequences would particularly interesting natural this context since m l randomness defined terms symbol itself citation
MISC--: despite several attempts solve this problem citation remained open citation
AIMX--: this paper we construct m l random sequence show existence universal semimeasure does not converge this sequence hence answering open question negatively some symbol
MISC--: remains open whether there exist other universal semimeasures probably particularly interesting additional structure properties m l convergence holds
OWNX--: main positive contribution this work construction non universal enumerable semimeasure symbol m l converges symbol desired
OWNX--: intermediate step we consider incomputable measure symbol defined mixture over all computable measures

OWNX--: section we present our main positive result
OWNX--: we derive finite bound hellinger sum between symbol symbol exponential randomness deficiency sequence double exponential complexity symbol
