MISC--: test learner s performance giving sequence symbol generated source check its predictions every bit symbol error occurs at time symbol if prediction symbol differs true bit value symbol
MISC--: denote symbol sequence errors where error bit symbol at time symbol equals symbol symbol according whether event error occurs not respectively
OWNX--: consider subsequence symbol symbol corresponds errors predicting symbol ie symbol consists bits symbol only at times symbol symbol this paper we compute upper bound deviation frequency symbol s symbol symbol showing dependence symbol symbol symbol
MISC--: basic theory finite markov chains since matrix symbol stochastic i e sum elements any row equals symbol then symbol stationary joint probability distribution symbol not necessarily unique
OWNX--: keep notation simple we use symbol denote also any marginal distribution derived stationary joint distribution
MISC--: instance symbol

OWNX--: we denote them symbol instance suppose symbol symbol consider two states symbol symbol
MISC--: corresponding transition probability symbol based symbol learner estimates symbol symbol where state symbol symbol denotes number times symbol appears symbol symbol denotes number times there transition state symbol symbol symbol
MISC--: instance if symbol symbol symbol then symbol
MISC--: thus symbol frequency state transitions symbol
MISC--: note symbol symbol dependent random variables since markov chain may visit each state random number times they must satisfy symbol
OWNX--: after training learner tested remaining symbol bits data symbol

OWNX--: we now prove claim will used section
MISC--: let us denote symbol symbol symbol particular sequence states corresponding sequence symbol
OWNX--: show dependence symbol symbol we will sometimes write symbol
MISC--: then we symbol since at every bit there only two types transitions then not every sequence symbol possible
MISC--: instance if symbol then state sequence symbol valid but symbol not valid
MISC--: denote symbol set valid state sequences symbol
MISC--: we now show if symbol symbol then conditioned symbol any other state sequence visits same states symbol same number times perhaps different order must same probability
MISC--: any state symbol denote symbol random variable whose value number type transitions state symbol sequence random states symbol
MISC--: define symbol number type transitions state symbol sequence symbol
MISC--: since all state transitions either type type then we symbol where symbol was defined above
MISC--: let symbol non negative integer parameter define random variable symbol
MISC--: associate conditional probability function parameter symbol random variable symbol symbol then right side equals symbol fixed value symbol event symbol equivalent event symbol
MISC--: hence alternatively right side expressed symbol right side product probability functions random variables symbol
MISC--: so conditioned symbol event symbol corresponds valid state sequence symbol event symbol generated source markov chain symbol equivalent event its corresponding state sequence symbol transition frequencies symbol independently take particular values symbol prescribed symbol

AIMX--: let symbol assume learner s model order symbol satisfies symbol we now state main result paper
OWNX--: before presenting proof we make following remarks effect training sequence length symbol symbol symbol symbol
MISC--: symbol increases class possible learnt models hypothesis class decreases size thereby decreasing bound symbol deviation error sequence
MISC--: effect learner s model order symbol opposite symbol
MISC--: we see symbol symbol increases hypothesis class increases size
MISC--: effect length symbol error sequence symbol symbol
