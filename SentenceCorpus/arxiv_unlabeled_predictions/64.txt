OWNX--: we consider problem minimal correction training set make consistent monotonic constraints
MISC--: this problem arises during analysis data sets via techniques require monotone data
OWNX--: we show this problem np hard general equivalent finding maximal independent set special orgraphs
MISC--: practically important cases problem considered detail
MISC--: cases when partial order given replies set total order dimension
OWNX--: we show second case reduced maximization quadratic convex function convex set
OWNX--: this case we construct approximate polynomial algorithm based convex optimization
MISC--: keywords machine learning supervised learning monotonic constraints
MISC--: requirements classifying rule supervised learning problems consist two parts
MISC--: first part induced set precedents called training set
MISC--: each element training set pair object reply type
MISC--: classifying rule mapping objects set replies set should map objects training set pairs consistent replies
MISC--: second part requirements express our common knowledge classifying rule
MISC--: one popular types requirements monotonicity considered paper
OWNX--: some cases two parts requirements not satisfied both then we problem minimal correction training set
MISC--: let us see what problem
OWNX--: suppose sets symbol given this sets we partial orders symbol consistently
OWNX--: we assume more partial order symbol lattice
OWNX--: any given mapping symbol where symbol we pose problem finding function symbol monotone due partial orders symbol minimizes following functional symbol
MISC--: let us denote set monotonic functions symbol symbol symbol
OWNX--: then given mapping symbol our task following symbol every mapping symbol monotone subset symbol extended mapping monotone whole set symbol because symbol lattice
MISC--: actually every finite subset lattice symbol operation symbol defined function symbol both monotone satisfies symbol
OWNX--: this we see posed problem we imply symbol
OWNX--: above said we conclude more this problem equivalent finding maximal subset symbol function symbol restricted subset symbol monotone
OWNX--: so let us consider following generalization our problem we will call maxcms maximal consistent monotonicity set maxcms finite sets symbol where symbol given each them partial orders symbol defined consistently function symbol given
MISC--: then every element symbol assigned positive integer weight symbol
OWNX--: our task find maximal weight subset symbol function symbol restricted symbol monotone i e symbol definition set symbol called acceptable iff function symbol restricted symbol monotone definition set acceptable maximal weight denoted symbol some cases we use this notation mean weight this set
OWNX--: remainder paper we will consider problem
