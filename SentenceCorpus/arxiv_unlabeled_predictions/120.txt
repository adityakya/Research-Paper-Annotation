AIMX--: we present extension principal component analysis pca new algorithm clustering points symbol based
MISC--: key property algorithm affine invariant
MISC--: when input sample mixture two arbitrary gaussians algorithm correctly classifies sample assuming only two components separable hyperplane ie there exists halfspace contains most one gaussian almost none other probability mass
OWNX--: this nearly best possible improving known results substantially citation
CONT--: symbol components algorithm requires only there some symbol dimensional subspace overlap every direction small
OWNX--: here we define overlap ratio following two quantities average squared distance between point mean its component average squared distance between point mean mixture
MISC--: main result may also stated language linear discriminant analysis if standard fisher discriminant citation small enough labels not needed estimate optimal subspace projection
OWNX--: our main tools isotropic transformation spectral projection simple reweighting technique
OWNX--: we call this combination isotropic pca
MISC--: we present extension principal component analysis pca able go beyond standard pca identifying important directions
MISC--: when covariance matrix input distribution point set symbol multiple identity then pca reveals no information second moment along any direction same
MISC--: inputs called isotropic
OWNX--: our extension we call isotropic pca reveal interesting information settings
OWNX--: we use this technique give affine invariant clustering algorithm points symbol
MISC--: when applied problem unraveling mixtures arbitrary gaussians unlabeled samples algorithm yields substantial improvements known results
MISC--: illustrate technique consider uniform distribution set symbol isotropic
OWNX--: suppose this distribution rotated unknown way we would like recover original symbol symbol axes
OWNX--: each point sample we may project unit circle compute covariance matrix resulting point set
MISC--: symbol direction will correspond greater eigenvector symbol direction other
MISC--: see figure illustration
MISC--: instead projection onto unit circle this process may also thought importance weighting technique allows one simulate one distribution another
AIMX--: this case we simulating distribution over set symbol where density function proportional symbol so points near symbol symbol more probable this paper we describe how apply this method mixtures arbitrary gaussians symbol order find set directions along gaussians well separated
MISC--: directions span fisher subspace mixture classical concept pattern recognition
OWNX--: once directions identified points classified according component distribution generated them hence all parameters mixture learned
AIMX--: what separates this paper previous work learning mixtures our algorithm affine invariant
CONT--: indeed every mixture distribution learned using previously known algorithm there linear transformation bounded condition number causes algorithm fail
OWNX--: symbol components our algorithm nearly best possible guarantees subsumes all previous results clustering gaussian mixtures
MISC--: symbol requires there symbol dimensional subspace where overlap components small every direction see section
OWNX--: this condition stated terms fisher discriminant quantity commonly used field pattern recognition labeled data
OWNX--: because our algorithm affine invariant makes possible unravel much larger set gaussian mixtures than had been possible previously
OWNX--: first step our algorithm place mixture isotropic position see section via affine transformation
CONT--: this effect making symbol dimensional fisher subspace i e one minimizes fisher discriminant same subspace spanned means components they only coincide general isotropic position any mixture
CONT--: rest algorithm identifies directions close this subspace uses them cluster without access labels
OWNX--: intuitively this hard since after isotropy standard pca reveals no additional information
OWNX--: before presenting ideas guarantees more detail we describe relevant related work
