OWNX--: we describe approach domain adaptation appropriate exactly case when one enough target data do slightly better than just using only source data
OWNX--: our approach incredibly simple easy implement preprocessing step lines perl outperforms state art approaches range datasets
MISC--: moreover trivially extended multi domain adaptation problem where one data variety different domains
MISC--: task domain adaptation develop learning algorithms easily ported one domain another say newswire biomedical documents
OWNX--: this problem particularly interesting nlp because we often situation we large collection labeled data one source domain say newswire but truly desire model performs well second target domain
AIMX--: approach we present this paper based idea transforming domain adaptation learning problem into standard supervised learning problem any standard algorithm may applied eg maxent svms etc
OWNX--: our transformation incredibly simple we augment feature space both source target data use result input standard learning algorithm
MISC--: there roughly two varieties domain adaptation problem been addressed literature fully supervised case semi supervised case
OWNX--: fully supervised case models following scenario
OWNX--: we access large annotated corpus data source domain
OWNX--: addition we spend little money annotate small corpus target domain
OWNX--: we want leverage both annotated datasets obtain model performs well target domain
OWNX--: semi supervised case similar but instead having small annotated target corpus we large but unannotated target corpus
AIMX--: this paper we focus exclusively fully supervised case
OWNX--: one particularly nice property our approach incredibly easy implement appendix provides symbol line symbol character perl script performing complete transformation available at url http hal
MISC--: name easyadapt
MISC--: pl
MISC--: gz
OWNX--: addition this simplicity our algorithm performs well some cases better than current state art techniques
