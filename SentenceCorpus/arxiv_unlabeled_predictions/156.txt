MISC--: models near rigid shape matching typically based distance related features order infer matches consistent isometric assumption
CONT--: however real shapes image datasets even when expected related almost isometric transformations actually subject not only noise but also some limited degree variations appearance scale
AIMX--: this paper we introduce graphical model parameterises appearance distance angle features we learn all involved parameters via structured prediction
OWNX--: outcome model near rigid shape matching robust sense able capture possibly limited but still important scale appearance variations
OWNX--: our experimental results reveal substantial improvements upon recent successful models while maintaining similar running times
MISC--: matching shapes images many applications including image retrieval alignment registration citation
OWNX--: typically matching approached selecting features set landmark points both images correspondence between two then chosen some distance measure between features minimised
MISC--: great deal attention been devoted defining complex features robust changes rotation scale etc
MISC--: citation
MISC--: important class matching problems near isometric shape matching
MISC--: this setting assumed shapes defined up isometric transformation allowing some noise therefore distance features typically used encode shape
MISC--: some traditional methods related settings focus optimisation over space rigid transformations so minimise least squares criteria citation
MISC--: recently this class problems been approached different perspective direct optimisation over space correspondences citation
MISC--: although apparently more expensive there shown rigidity assumption imposes convenient algebraic structure correspondence space so allow efficient algorithms exact inference chordal graphical models small clique size
MISC--: more recently methods been made substantially faster citation
MISC--: key idea methods explicitly encode rigidity constraints into tractable graphical model whose map solution corresponds best match
OWNX--: however main advantages correspondence based optimisation over transformation based optimisation namely flexibility encoding powerful local features not been further explored this framework
MISC--: other lines work optimise directly over correspondence space those based graph matching explicitly model all pairwise compatibilities solve best match some relaxation since graph matching problem np hard general pairwise compatibilities citation
MISC--: recently was shown both citation citation if some form structured optimisation used optimise graph matching scores relaxed quadratic assignment predictors improve power pairwise features
MISC--: key idea methods learn compatibility scores graph matching objective function therefore enriching representability features
CONT--: downside graph matching methods however they do not typically make explicit use geometry scene order improve computational efficiency accuracy
AIMX--: this paper we combine two lines work into single framework
OWNX--: we produce exact efficient model solve near isometric shape matching problems using not only isometry invariant features but also appearance scale invariant features all encoded tractable graphical model
OWNX--: doing so we learn via large margin structured prediction relative importances variations appearance scale regard variations shape per se
OWNX--: therefore even knowing we near isometric setting we will still capture eventual variations appearance scale into our matching criterion order produce robust near isometric matcher
AIMX--: terms learning we introduce two stage structured learning approach address speed memory efficiency this model
OWNX--: remainder this paper structured follows section we give brief introduction shape matching graphical models discriminative structured learning
OWNX--: section we present our model experiments follow section
