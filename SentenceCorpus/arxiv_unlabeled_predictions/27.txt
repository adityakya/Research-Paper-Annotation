CONT--: we start simple asymptotic result problem line regression quadratic loss function class continuous limited memory prediction strategies admits leading prediction strategy not only asymptotically performs at least well any continuous limited memory strategy but also satisfies property excess loss any continuous limited memory strategy determined how closely imitates leading strategy
OWNX--: more specifically any class prediction strategies constituting reproducing kernel hilbert space we construct leading strategy sense loss any prediction strategy whose norm not too large determined how closely imitates leading strategy
OWNX--: this result extended loss functions given bregman divergences strictly proper scoring rules
MISC--: suppose symbol normed function class prediction strategies benchmark class
MISC--: well known under some restrictions symbol there exists master prediction strategy sometimes also called universal strategy performs almost well best strategies symbol whose norm not too large see eg citation
OWNX--: leading prediction strategies constructed this paper satisfy stronger property loss any prediction strategy symbol whose norm not too large exceeds loss leading strategy divergence between predictions output two prediction strategies
MISC--: therefore leading strategy implicitly serves standard prediction strategies symbol symbol whose norm not too large prediction strategy symbol suffers small loss degree its predictions resemble leading strategy s predictions only way compete leading strategy imitate iffullfrom practical point view master strategies much more interesting than leading strategies although existence leading strategies very curious fact blueend we start formal exposition simple asymptotic result proposition s asserting existence leading strategies problem line regression quadratic loss function class continuous limited memory prediction strategies
AIMX--: state non asymptotic version this result proposition we introduce several general definitions used throughout paper
OWNX--: following two sections proposition generalized two directions loss functions given bregman divergences s strictly proper scoring rules s
AIMX--: competitive line prediction typically avoids making any stochastic assumptions about way observations generated but we consider mostly comparison purposes case where observations generated stochastically
AIMX--: section contains most references related literature although there bibliographical remarks scattered throughout paper
OWNX--: some proofs proof sketches given s rest found full version this paper citation
MISC--: proofs gathered s
OWNX--: final section s discusses general picture possible directions further research
MISC--: there many techniques constructing master strategies gradient descent strong weak aggregating algorithms following perturbed leader defensive forecasting mention just few
BASE--: this paper we will use defensive forecasting proposed citation based citation much earlier work levin foster vohra
MISC--: master strategies constructed using defensive forecasting automatically satisfy stronger properties required leading strategies other hand not clear whether leading strategies constructed using other techniques
