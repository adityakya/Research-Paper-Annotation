OWNX--: we consider semi supervised classification when part available data unlabeled
OWNX--: unlabeled data useful classification problem when we make assumption relating behavior regression function marginal distribution
MISC--: seeger citation proposed well known cluster assumption reasonable one
OWNX--: we propose mathematical formulation this assumption method based density level sets estimation takes advantage achieve fast rates convergence both number unlabeled examples number labeled examples
MISC--: setcounter equation semi supervised classification been growing interest over past few years many methods been proposed
MISC--: methods try give answer question how improve classification accuracy using unlabeled data together labeled data
MISC--: 
OWNX--: unlabeled data used different ways depending assumptions model
MISC--: there two types assumptions
OWNX--: first one consists assuming we set potential classifiers we want aggregate them
MISC--: case unlabeled data used measure compatibility between classifiers reduces complexity resulting classifier see eg citation citation
OWNX--: second approach one we use here
OWNX--: assumes data contains clusters homogeneous labels unlabeled observations used identify clusters
MISC--: this so called cluster assumption
MISC--: this idea put practice several ways giving rise various methods
MISC--: simplest one presented here estimate clusters then label each cluster uniformly
MISC--: most methods use hartigan s citation definition clusters namely connected components density level sets
CONT--: however they use parametric usually mixture model estimate underlying density far reality
MISC--: moreover no generalization error bounds available methods
MISC--: same spirit citation citation propose methods learn distance using unlabeled data order intra cluster distances smaller than inter clusters distances
MISC--: whole family graph based methods aims also at using unlabeled data learn distances between points
MISC--: edges graphs reflect proximity between points
MISC--: detailed survey graph methods we refer citation
OWNX--: finally we mention kernel methods where unlabeled data used build kernel
MISC--: recalling kernel measures proximity between points methods also viewed learning distance using unlabeled data see citation citation citation
OWNX--: cluster assumption interpreted another way i e requirement decision boundary lie low density regions
MISC--: this interpretation been widely used learning since used design standard algorithms boosting citation citation svm citation citation closely related kernel methods mentioned above
MISC--: algorithms greater penalization given decision boundaries cross cluster
MISC--: more details see eg citation citation citation
MISC--: although most methods make sometimes implicitly cluster assumption no formulation probabilistic terms been provided so far
AIMX--: formulation we propose this paper remains very close its original text formulation allows derive generalization error bounds
OWNX--: we also discuss what cannot done using unlabeled data
OWNX--: one conclusions considering whole excess risk too ambitious we need concentrate smaller part observe improvement semi supervised classification over standard classification
AIMX--: outline paper
OWNX--: after describing model we formulate cluster assumption discuss why how improve classification performance next section
OWNX--: section we study population case when marginal density symbol known get idea our target
OWNX--: indeed population case corresponds some way case when amount unlabeled data infinite
OWNX--: section contains main result we propose algorithm we derive rates convergence symbol thresholded excess risk measure performance
OWNX--: exemple consistent density level set estimators given section
OWNX--: section devoted discussion choice symbol possible improvements
OWNX--: proofs results gathered section
MISC--: notation
OWNX--: throughout paper we denote symbol positive constants
OWNX--: we write symbol complement set symbol
OWNX--: two sequences symbol symbol paper symbol will symbol symbol we write symbol if there exists constant symbol symbol we write symbol if symbol some constants symbol
OWNX--: thus if symbol we symbol any symbol
