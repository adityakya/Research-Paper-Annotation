OWNX--: we study problem estimating time delay between two signals representing delayed irregularly sampled noisy versions same underlying pattern
OWNX--: we propose demonstrate evolutionary algorithm hyper parameter estimation kernel based technique context astronomical problem namely estimating time delay between two gravitationally lensed signals distant quasar
MISC--: mixed types integer real used represent variables within evolutionary algorithm
OWNX--: we test algorithm several artificial data sets also real astronomical observations quasar q
OWNX--: carrying out statistical analysis results we present detailed comparison our method most popular methods time delay estimation astrophysics
OWNX--: our method yields more accurate more stable time delay estimates q we obtain days between images b
OWNX--: our methodology readily applied current state art optical monitoring data astronomy but also applied other disciplines involving similar time series data
MISC--: estimation time delay delay between arrival times two signals originate same source but travel along different paths observer real world problem astronomy
MISC--: time series analysed could instance represent repeated measurement over many months years flux radiation optical light radio waves very distant quasar very bright source light usually few billion light years away
OWNX--: some quasars appear set multiple nearby images sky due fact trajectory light coming source gets bent passes massive galaxy way lens result observer receives light various directions resulting detection several images citation
OWNX--: this phenomenon called gravitational lensing natural consequence prediction general theory relativity postulates massive objects distort space time thus cause bending trajectories light rays passing near them
MISC--: quasars variable sources same sequence variations detected at different times different images according travel time along various paths
MISC--: time delay between signals depends mass lens thus most direct method measure distribution matter universe often dark citation
OWNX--: this scenario underlying pattern time emitted flux intensities quasar gets delayed corrupted all kinds noise processes
MISC--: example astronomical time series not only corrupted observational noise but they also typically irregularly sampled possibly large observational gaps missing data citation
MISC--: this due practical limitations observation equipment availability weather conditions brightness moon among many other factors citation
MISC--: over hundred systems lensed quasars currently known about been monitored long periods some cases measurement time delay been claimed
OWNX--: here we focus q first multiply imaged quasar discovered citation
MISC--: this source pair images here referred b been monitored over twenty years despite numerous claims universally agreed value time delay this system not emerged citation
AIMX--: earlier paper we presented analysis repeated radio observations along simulated data generated according properties observations citation show kernel based approach improve upon currently popular methods estimating time delays real astronomical data
CONT--: more common form observations however employs optical telescopes monitoring known multiply imaged sources observations inherent problems require modification our previous approach
