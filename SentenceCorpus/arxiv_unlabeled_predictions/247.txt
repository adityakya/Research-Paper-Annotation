OWNX--: given matrix symbol low rank we consider problem reconstructing noisy observations small random subset its entries
MISC--: problem arises variety applications collaborative filtering netflix problem structure motion positioning
AIMX--: we study low complexity algorithm introduced citation based combination spectral techniques manifold optimization we call here optspace
OWNX--: we prove performance guarantees order optimal number circumstances
MISC--: spectral techniques authentic workhorse machine learning statistics numerical analysis signal processing
MISC--: given matrix symbol its largest singular values associated singular vectors explain most significant correlations underlying data source
OWNX--: low rank approximation symbol further used low complexity implementations number linear algebra algorithms citation
OWNX--: many practical circumstances we access only sparse subset entries symbol matrix symbol
MISC--: recently been discovered if matrix symbol rank symbol unless too structured small random subset its entries allow reconstruct exactly
MISC--: this result was first proved citation analyzing convex relaxation introduced citation
MISC--: tighter analysis same convex relaxation was carried out citation
MISC--: number iterative schemes solve convex optimization problem appeared soon thereafter citation
MISC--: alternative line work citation attacked same problem using combination spectral techniques manifold optimization we will refer their algorithm optspace optspace intrinsically low complexity most complex operation being computing symbol singular values corresponding singular vectors sparse symbol matrix
MISC--: performance guarantees proved citation comparable information theoretic lower bound roughly symbol random entries needed reconstruct symbol exactly here we assume symbol order symbol
OWNX--: related approach was also developed citation although without performance guarantees matrix completion
OWNX--: above results crucially rely assumption symbol exactly rank symbol matrix
MISC--: many applications interest this assumption unrealistic therefore important investigate their robustness
OWNX--: above approaches generalized when underlying data well approximated rank symbol matrix
MISC--: this question was addressed citation within convex relaxation approach citation
AIMX--: present paper proves similar robustness result optspace
OWNX--: remarkably guarantees we obtain order optimal variety circumstances improve over analogous results citation
