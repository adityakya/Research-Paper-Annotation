MISC--: repeatability efficiency corner detector determines how likely useful real world application
MISC--: repeatability importand because same scene viewed different positions should yield features correspond same real world d locations citation
OWNX--: efficiency important because this determines whether detector combined further processing operate at frame rate
AIMX--: three advances described this paper
AIMX--: first we present new heuristic feature detection using machine learning we derive feature detector this fully process live pal video using less than available processing time
MISC--: comparison most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate harris detector sift
OWNX--: second we generalize detector allowing optimized repeatability little loss efficiency
OWNX--: third we carry out rigorous comparison corner detectors based above repeatability criterion applied d scenes
AIMX--: we show despite being principally constructed speed stringent tests our heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors
MISC--: finally comparison demonstrates using machine learning produces significant improvements repeatability yielding detector both very fast very high quality
OWNX--: parstart c orner detection used first step many vision tasks tracking localisation slam simultaneous localisation mapping image matching recognition
MISC--: this need driven development large number corner detectors
MISC--: however despite massive increase computing power since inception corner detectors still true when processing live video streams at full frame rate existing feature detectors leave little if any time further processing
MISC--: applications described above corners typically detected matched into database thus important same real world points detected repeatably multiple views citation
MISC--: amount variation viewpoint under this condition should hold depends application
