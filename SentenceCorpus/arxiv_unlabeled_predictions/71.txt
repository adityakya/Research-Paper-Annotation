MISC--: many authors studied variety related ideas
MISC--: gaussian case model selection involves finding pattern zeros inverse covariance matrix since zeros correspond conditional independencies among variables
MISC--: traditionally greedy forward backward search algorithm used determine zero pattern citation
CONT--: however this computationally infeasible data even moderate number variables
MISC--: citation introduce gradient descent algorithm they account sparsity inverse covariance matrix defining loss function negative log likelihood function
MISC--: recently citation considered penalized maximum likelihood estimation citation proposed set large scale methods problems where sparsity pattern inverse covariance given one must estimate nonzero elements matrix

MISC--: this vein citation employ stochastic algorithm manage tens thousands variables
MISC--: there also been great deal interest using symbol norm penalties statistical applications
MISC--: citation apply symbol norm penalty sparse principle component analysis

OWNX--: problem formulation gaussian data therefore simple
