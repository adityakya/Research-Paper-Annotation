AIMX--: this paper we introduce class stationary prediction strategies construct prediction algorithm asymptotically performs well best continuous stationary strategy
OWNX--: we make mild compactness assumptions but no stochastic assumptions about environment
MISC--: particular no assumption stationarity made about environment stationarity considered strategies only means they do not depend explicitly time we argue natural consider only stationary strategies even highly non stationary environments
MISC--: this paper belongs area learning theory been variously referred prediction expert advice competitive line prediction prediction individual sequences universal line learning see citation review
MISC--: there many proof techniques known this field this paper based kalnishkan vyugin s weak aggregating algorithm citation but possible some numerous other techniques could used instead
OWNX--: section we give main definitions state our main results theorems their proofs given sections
OWNX--: section we informally discuss notion stationarity section concludes
