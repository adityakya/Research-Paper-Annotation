MISC--: large number spectral variables most data sets encountered spectral chemometrics often renders prediction dependent variable uneasy
MISC--: number variables hopefully reduced using either projection techniques selection methods latter allow interpretation selected variables
CONT--: since optimal approach testing all possible subsets variables prediction model intractable incremental selection approach using nonparametric statistics good option avoids computationally intensive use model itself
MISC--: two drawbacks however number groups variables test still huge colinearities make results unstable
AIMX--: overcome limitations this paper presents method select groups spectral variables
MISC--: consists forward backward procedure applied coefficients b spline representation spectra
MISC--: criterion used forward backward procedure mutual information allowing find nonlinear dependencies between variables contrary generally used correlation
MISC--: spline representation used get interpretability results groups consecutive spectral variables will selected
OWNX--: experiments conducted nir spectra fescue grass diesel fuels show method provides clearly identified groups selected variables making interpretation easy while keeping low computational load
MISC--: prediction performances obtained using selected coefficients higher than those obtained same method applied directly original variables similar those obtained using traditional models although using significantly less spectral variables
MISC--: prediction problems often encountered analytical spectral chemometrics
MISC--: they require estimating unknown value dependent variable example near infrared spectrum
MISC--: problems may encountered food citation pharmaceutical citation textile citation industry cite only few
MISC--: viewed statistical data analysis perspective main difficulty problem cope colinearity between spectral variables not only consecutive variables spectrum highly correlated nature but addition real applications usually concern databases low number known spectra high number spectral variables
MISC--: any method built original spectral variables thus ill posed making feature spectral variable selection projection necessary
MISC--: selection projection methods differ several aspects
MISC--: projection methods more general essence selection may regarded projection many zero weights
MISC--: however projection methods usually build factors latent variables combinations large number original features
MISC--: even if their prediction properties good they usually suffer fact latent variables hardly interpretable terms original features wavelengths case infrared spectra
MISC--: contrary selection methods based principle choosing small number variables among original ones leading easy interpretation
MISC--: course challenge selection methods obtain prediction performances same level projection ones
AIMX--: this work we interested variable selection methods providing interpretability
OWNX--: however if whole procedure consisting selecting features building prediction model them kept linear will certainly lead poorer performances than traditional widely used pls partial least squares latter consists projection prediction
OWNX--: thus investigated how nonlinear models may used both selecting features performing prediction
MISC--: nonlinear models could used wrapper approach citation their estimated generalization performances used relevance criterion group variables
OWNX--: this however very demanding terms computational load because resampling techniques must used estimate accurately predicted error model addition fact one model must learned each considered feature set
CONT--: this paper thus focuses so called filter approach features selected prior use any prediction model
MISC--: among filter methods correlation standard criterion used selecting features linear way features maximal correlation dependent output variable possibly minimal information between them avoid redundancy selected
MISC--: mutual information see eg citation extends correlation measure nonlinear dependencies while correlation strictly limited linear ones
MISC--: example correlation between centered antisymmetric variable its second power zero despite fact they obviously depend one another though nonlinear way
MISC--: mutual information avoids this drawback providing more general less restricted way measure dependencies between variables
MISC--: mutual information mi already been used select variables near infrared spectra citation
MISC--: despite provides promising way extend state art spectral analysis nonlinear methodologies direct selection variables mi suffers some drawbacks
MISC--: first mi estimation becomes difficult number selected variables grows
MISC--: indeed forward procedure estimation faced curse dimensionality making estimation mi last selected feature much more difficult than first selected one
MISC--: second low number spectra usually available learning makes results selection highly dependent data set small change data lead different selected variable sets resulting difficult interpretation
MISC--: finally even though estimation mutual information less demanding terms computation time than construction nonlinear model large number initial variables results high computation times selection
AIMX--: this paper we propose first reduce number variables through projection spectral features before selection mutual information
MISC--: maintain interpretability despite use projection latter achieved ensuring each coordinate projection corresponds restricted set initial features consecutive wavelengths
MISC--: general methodology proposed citation followed spectra projected functional basis
MISC--: more precisely eg citation projection basis b splines chosen rather than wavelets example indeed b splines advantage they span restricted interval wavelengths intervals roughly same length over whole range
MISC--: consequence each coefficient depends value corresponding spectrum limited wavelength interval
MISC--: complete procedure then consists replacing spectra their b spline coefficients selecting relevant coefficients measuring their mutual information output variable predicting latter using radial basis function networks any other nonlinear model could used
OWNX--: all three steps nonlinear giving procedure necessary flexibility reach high performances both prediction interpretation
OWNX--: design parameters unavoidable nonlinear context number b splines used projection set automatically without necessity user s choice using cross validation method
OWNX--: this paper shows prediction results obtained this procedure comparable than those obtained through conventional linear techniques pls
OWNX--: addition interpretability added number wavelengths selected procedure remains low making possible identify wavelengths responsible phenomenon predict
MISC--: moreover b spline compression allows us both reduce feature selection running time increase quality prediction results compared same nonlinear procedure applied directly original spectral variables
AIMX--: section this paper reminds how spectra projected basis b splines details how number b splines set automatically analyzes computational complexity procedure
OWNX--: section presents mutual information criterion its use forward backward procedure
MISC--: also investigates computational complexity forward backward method
OWNX--: section shows examples application proposed method two data sets
OWNX--: first one consists nir spectra obtained fescue grass aim predict nitrogen content plant
MISC--: second one database spectra fuel samples goal predict cetane number fuel
