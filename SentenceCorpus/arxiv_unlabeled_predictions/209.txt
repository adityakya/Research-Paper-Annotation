OWNX--: we study tracking problem numerous applications ai control finance
OWNX--: tracking we given noisy measurements over time problem estimate hidden state object
MISC--: challenge do this reliably combining measurements multiple time steps prior knowledge about state dynamics goal tracking produce estimates close true states possible
MISC--: most popular solutions tracking problem kalman filter citation particle filter citation their numerous extensions variations eg citation based generative framework tracking problem
OWNX--: suppose we want track state symbol object at time symbol given only measurement vectors symbol changeto at time times symbol
OWNX--: generative approach we think state symbol measurements symbol random variables
OWNX--: we represent our knowledge regarding dynamics states using transition process symbol our knowledge regarding noisy relationship between states observations measurement process symbol
MISC--: then given only observations goal tracking estimate hidden state sequence symbol
MISC--: this done calculating likelihood each state sequence then using estimate either sequence highest posterior probability maximum posteriori map expected value state respect posterior distribution bayesian algorithm
MISC--: practice one uses particle filters approximation bayesian algorithm
MISC--: problem generative framework practice very difficult precisely determine distributions measurements
MISC--: moreover bayesian algorithm very sensitive model mismatches changeto so using model slightly different model generating measurements lead large divergence between estimated states true states
AIMX--: address this we introduce online learning based framework tracking
OWNX--: our framework called framework we given set state sequences paths state space but instead assuming observations changeto generated generated measurement model changeto path this set path this set we think each path mechanism explaining observations
OWNX--: we emphasize this done regardless how observations generated
OWNX--: suppose changeto path changeto symbol symbol proposed explanation observations changeto symbol symbol changeto then we we measure quality this explanatory path using predefined loss function depends only measurements not hidden true state
MISC--: tracking algorithm selects its own explanatory path taking weighted average best explanatory paths according past observations
OWNX--: theoretical guarantee we provide loss explanatory path generated this online way tracking algorithm close explanatory path minimum changeto loss where loss here loss measured according loss function supplied algorithm
MISC--: guarantees analogous competitive analysis used online learning citation important note guarantees hold uniformly any sequence observations regardless any probabilistic assumptions
OWNX--: our next contribution provide online learning based algorithm tracking explanatory framework
CONT--: our algorithm based nhedge citation general online learning algorithm nhedge instantiated any loss function
MISC--: when supplied bounded loss function guaranteed produce path loss close path minimum loss set candidate paths
OWNX--: inefficient directly apply nhedge tracking we derive sequential changeto monte carlo based monte carlo approximation nhedge we show this approximation efficient
OWNX--: demonstrate robustness our tracking algorithm we perform simulations simple one dimensional tracking problem
OWNX--: we evaluate tracking performance measuring average distance between states estimated algorithms true hidden states
OWNX--: we instantiate our algorithm simple clipping loss function
CONT--: our simulations show our algorithm consistently outperforms bayesian algorithm under high measurement noise wide range levels model mismatch
OWNX--: we note bayesian algorithm also interpreted explanatory framework
MISC--: particular if loss path negative log likelihood log loss under some measurement model then bayesian algorithm shown produce path log loss close path minimum log loss
AIMX--: one may tempted think our tracking solution follows same approach however point our paper one use loss functions different log loss particular we show scenario changeto where using other loss functions produces better tracking performance than bayesian algorithm its approximations
