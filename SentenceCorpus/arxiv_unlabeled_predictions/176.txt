MISC--: importance combining datasets especially evident biomedicine
MISC--: pharmacological experiments few training examples typically available specific subject due technological ethical constraints citation
OWNX--: this makes hard formulate quantify models experimental data
MISC--: obviate this problem so called population method been studied applied success since seventies pharmacology citation
MISC--: population methods based knowledge subjects albeit different belong population similar individuals so data collected one subject may informative respect others citation

MISC--: methods clinical measurements different subjects combined simultaneously learn individual features physiological responses drug administration citation
MISC--: population methods been applied success also other biomedical contexts medical imaging bioinformatics citation
MISC--: classical approaches postulate finite dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems whose unknown parameters determined means optimization algorithms citation

MISC--: information fusion different but related datasets widespread also econometrics marketing analysis where goal learn user preferences analyzing both user specific information information related users see eg citation
MISC--: so called conjoint analysis aims determine features product mostly influence customer s decisions
MISC--: web collaborative approaches estimate user preferences become standard methodologies many commercial systems social networks under name collaborative filtering recommender systems see eg citation
MISC--: pioneering collaborative filtering systems include tapestry citation grouplens citation referralweb citation phoaks citation

MISC--: line multi task learning schemes find their natural application data mining problems involving very large datasets therefore required scale well number tasks examples
MISC--: citation line task wise algorithm solve multi task regression problems been proposed
OWNX--: learning problem formulated context line bayesian estimation see eg citation within gaussian processes suitable covariance functions used characterize non parametric mixed effect model
MISC--: one key features algorithm capability exploit shared inputs between tasks order reduce computational complexity
CONT--: however algorithm citation centralized structure tasks sequentially analyzed not able address neither architectural issues regarding flux information nor privacy protection
AIMX--: this paper multi task learning distributed datasets addressed using client server architecture
OWNX--: our scheme clients one one correspondence tasks their individual database examples
MISC--: role server collect examples different clients order summarize their informative content
MISC--: when new example associated any task becomes available server executes line update algorithm
CONT--: while citation different tasks sequentially analyzed architecture presented this paper process examples coming any order different learning tasks
MISC--: summarized information stored disclosed database whose content available download enabling each client compute its own estimate exploiting informative content all other datasets
MISC--: particular attention paid confidentiality issues especially valuable commercial recommender systems see eg citation
OWNX--: first we require each specific client cannot access other clients data
MISC--: addition individual datasets cannot reconstructed disclosed database
MISC--: two kind clients considered active passive ones
MISC--: active client sends its data server thus contributing collaborative estimate
MISC--: passive client only downloads information disclosed database without sending its data
OWNX--: regularization problem parametric bias term considered mixed effect kernel used exploit relationships between tasks
MISC--: albeit specific mixed effect non parametric model quite flexible its usefulness been demonstrated several works citation
