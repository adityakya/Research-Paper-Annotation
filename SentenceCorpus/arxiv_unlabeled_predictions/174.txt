OWNX--: we consider multi round auction setting motivated pay per click auctions internet advertising
MISC--: each round auctioneer selects advertiser shows her ad then either clicked not
MISC--: advertiser derives value clicks value click her private information
MISC--: initially neither auctioneer nor advertisers any information about likelihood clicks advertisements
MISC--: auctioneer s goal design dominant strategies truthful mechanism approximately maximizes social welfare
OWNX--: if advertisers bid their true private values our problem equivalent multi armed bandit problem thus viewed strategic version latter
MISC--: particular both problems quality algorithm characterized regret difference social welfare between algorithm benchmark always selects same best advertisement
OWNX--: we investigate how design multi armed bandit algorithms affected restriction resulting mechanism must truthful
MISC--: we find deterministic truthful mechanisms certain strong structural properties essentially they must separate exploration exploitation they incur much higher regret than optimal multi armed bandit algorithms
OWNX--: moreover we provide truthful mechanism essentially matches our lower bound regret
MISC--: recent years there been much interest understanding implication strategic behavior performance algorithms whose input distributed among selfish agents
OWNX--: this study was mainly motivated internet main arena large scale interaction agents conflicting goals
MISC--: field algorithmic mechanism design citation studies design mechanisms computational settings background see recent book citation survey citation
MISC--: much attention been drawn market sponsored search e g citation multi billion dollar market numerous auctions running every second
MISC--: research sponsored search mostly focus equilibria generalized second price gsp auction citation auction most commonly used practice e g google bing design truthful auctions citation
OWNX--: all auctions rely knowing rates at users click different advertisements k
MISC--: click through rates ctrs do not consider process ctrs learned refined over time observing users behavior
MISC--: we argue strategic agents would take this process into account influences their utility
MISC--: while prior work citation focused influence click fraud methods learning ctrs we interested implications strategic bidding agents
OWNX--: thus we consider problem designing truthful sponsored search auctions when process learning ctrs part game
OWNX--: we mainly interested interplay between online learning strategic bidding
OWNX--: isolate this issue we consider following setting natural strategic version multi armed bandit mab problem
MISC--: this setting there symbol agents
MISC--: each agent symbol single advertisement private value symbol every click she gets
OWNX--: mechanism online algorithm first solicits bids agents then runs symbol rounds
MISC--: each round mechanism picks agent using bids clicks observed past rounds displays her advertisement receives feedback if there was click not
OWNX--: payments charged after round symbol
MISC--: each agent tries maximize her own utility value she derives clicks minus payment she pays
MISC--: we assume initially no information known about likelihood each agent clicked particular there no bayesian priors
MISC--: we interested designing mechanisms truthful dominant strategies every agent maximizes her utility bidding truthfully any bids others any clicks would been received
MISC--: goal maximize social welfare omit since payments cancel out this equivalent maximizing total value derived clicks where agent s contribution total her private value times number clicks she receives
OWNX--: we call this setting omit absence strategic behavior this problem reduces standard mab formulation algorithm repeatedly chooses one symbol alternatives arms observes associated payoff value per click corresponding ad if ad clicked symbol otherwise
MISC--: crucial aspect mab problems tradeoff between acquiring more information exploration using current information choose good agent exploitation
MISC--: mab problems been studied intensively past three decades
MISC--: particular above formulation well understood citation terms regret relative benchmark always chooses same best alternative time invariant benchmark
MISC--: this notion regret naturally extends strategic setting outlined above total payoff being exactly equal social welfare regret being exactly loss social welfare relative time invariant benchmark
MISC--: thus one directly compare mab algorithms mab mechanisms terms welfare loss regret
OWNX--: broadly we ask how design mab algorithms affected restriction truthfulness what difference between best algorithms best truthful mechanisms
MISC--: we interested both terms structural properties gap performance terms regret
OWNX--: we not aware any prior work characterizes truthful online learning algorithms proves negative results their performance
