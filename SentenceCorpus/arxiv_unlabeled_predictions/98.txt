OWNX--: markov random fields used model high dimensional distributions number applied areas
MISC--: much recent interest been devoted reconstruction dependency structure independent samples markov random fields
OWNX--: we analyze simple algorithm reconstructing underlying graph defining markov random field symbol nodes maximum degree symbol given observations
OWNX--: we show under mild non degeneracy conditions reconstructs generating graph high probability using symbol samples where symbol depend local interactions
OWNX--: most local interaction symbol order symbol
OWNX--: our results optimal function symbol up multiplicative constant depending symbol strength local interactions
OWNX--: our results seem first results general models guarantee generating model reconstructed
OWNX--: furthermore we provide explicit symbol running time bound
MISC--: cases where measure graph correlation decay running time symbol all fixed symbol
OWNX--: we also discuss effect observing noisy samples show long noise level low our algorithm effective
MISC--: other hand we construct example where large noise implies non identifiability even generic noise interactions
OWNX--: finally we briefly show some simple cases models hidden nodes also recovered
AIMX--: this paper we consider problem reconstructing graph structure markov random field independent identically distributed samples
MISC--: markov random fields mrf provide very general framework defining high dimensional distributions reconstruction mrf observations attracted much recent interest particular biology see eg citation list related references citation
