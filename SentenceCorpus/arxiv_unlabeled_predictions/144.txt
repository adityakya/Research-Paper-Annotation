MISC--: using game theoretic framework probability vovk shafer citation shown always possible using randomization make sequential probability forecasts pass any countable set well behaved statistical tests
MISC--: this result generalizes work other authors who consider only tests calbration
OWNX--: we complement this result lower bound
AIMX--: we show vovk shafer s result valid only when forecasts computed unrestrictedly increasing degree accuracy
OWNX--: when some level discreteness fixed we present game theoretic generalization oakes example randomized forecasting test failing any given method deferministic forecasting originally this example was presented deterministic calibration
MISC--: using game theoretic framework probability citation vovk shafer shown citation always possible using randomization make sequential probability forecasts pass any countable set well behaved statistical tests
MISC--: this result generalizes work other authors among them foster vohra citation kakade foster citation lehrer citation sandrony et al citation who consider only tests calibration
OWNX--: we complement this result lower bound
AIMX--: we show vovk shafer s result valid only when forecasts computed unrestrictedly increasing degree accuracy
OWNX--: when some level discreteness fixed we present game theoretic version oakes example randomized forecasting test failing any given method deterministic forecasting originally this example was presented deterministic calibration
BASE--: formulate this example we use forecasting game presented vovk shafer citation namely binary forecasting game ii
OWNX--: we discuss details randomized forecasting algorithms section
MISC--: shafer vovk s citation game theoretic framework considered section
OWNX--: we present this section original vovk shafer s citation result universal randomized forecasting prove our result gives limits forecasting game theoretic version oakes example randomized forecasting
