MISC--: statistical problems set parameterized probability distributions used estimate true probability distribution
OWNX--: if fisher information matrix at true distribution singular then been left unknown what we estimate about true distribution random samples
AIMX--: this paper we study singular regression problem prove limit theorem shows relation between singular regression problem two birational invariants real log canonical threshold singular fluctuation
MISC--: obtained theorem important application statistics because enables us estimate generalization error training error without any knowledge true probability distribution
OWNX--: let symbol symbol natural numbers symbol symbol symbol symbol dimensional real euclidean spaces respectively
MISC--: assume symbol probability space symbol symbol valued random variable subject simultaneous probability density function symbol where symbol probability density function symbol symbol constant symbol measurable function symbol symbol symbol euclidean norm symbol
MISC--: function symbol called regression function symbol
MISC--: assume symbol set random variables independently subject same probability distribution symbol
MISC--: let symbol subset symbol
MISC--: let symbol function symbol symbol
MISC--: square error symbol real function symbol symbol expectation operator symbol symbol defined symbol where symbol measurable function symbol probability density function symbol symbol constant called inverse temperature
MISC--: note symbol not constant but random variable because symbol depends random variables
MISC--: two random variables symbol symbol defined symbol random variables symbol symbol called generalization training errors respectively
MISC--: since symbol expected some natural conditions both symbol symbol converge symbol when symbol tends infinity if there exists symbol symbol
AIMX--: this paper we ask how fast convergences other words our study concerns limit theorem shows convergences symbol symbol when symbol
MISC--: if fisher information matrix symbol where symbol positive definite arbitrary symbol then this problem well known regular regression problem
MISC--: fact regular regression problem convergences symbol symbol hold
MISC--: however if symbol singular say if symbol then problem called singular regression problem convergences symbol symbol been left unknown
MISC--: general been difficult study limit theorem case when fisher information matrix singular
MISC--: however recently we shown limit theorem established based resolution singularities there mathematical relations between limit theorem two birational invariants singular density estimation citation
AIMX--: this paper we prove new limit theorem singular regression problem enables us estimate birational invariants random samples
MISC--: limit theorem proved this paper important application statistics because expectation value generalization error symbol estimated training error symbol without any knowledge true probability distribution vskip mm example let symbol symbol symbol symbol
MISC--: if function symbol defined symbol symbol then set symbol not one point fisher information matrix at symbol singular
OWNX--: lot functions used statistics information science brain informatics bio informatics singular example artificial neural networks radial basis functions wavelet functions
