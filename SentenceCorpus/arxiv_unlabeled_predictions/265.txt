OWNX--: multi armed bandit mab problem online algorithm makes sequence choices
MISC--: each round chooses time invariant set alternatives receives payoff associated this alternative
MISC--: while case small strategy sets now well understood lot recent work focused mab problems exponentially infinitely large strategy sets where one needs assume extra structure order make problem tractable
MISC--: particular recent literature considered information similarity between arms
OWNX--: we consider similarity information setting contextual bandits natural extension basic mab problem where before each round algorithm given context hint about payoffs this round
MISC--: contextual bandits directly motivated placing advertisements webpages one crucial problems sponsored search
MISC--: particularly simple way represent similarity information contextual bandit setting via similarity distance between context arm pairs bounds above difference between respective expected payoffs
MISC--: prior work contextual bandits similarity uses uniform partitions similarity space so each context arm pair approximated closest pair partition
MISC--: algorithms based uniform partitions disregard structure payoffs context arrivals potentially wasteful
OWNX--: we present algorithms based adaptive partitions take advantage benign payoffs context arrivals without sacrificing worst case performance
OWNX--: central idea maintain finer partition high payoff regions similarity space popular regions context space

OWNX--: this setting clean model exploration exploitation trade off crucial issue sequential decision making under uncertainty
OWNX--: one standard way evaluate performance bandit algorithm regret defined difference between expected payoff optimal arm algorithm
MISC--: now mab problem small finite set arms quite well understood eg see citation
OWNX--: however if arms set exponentially infinitely large problem becomes intractable unless we make further assumptions about problem instance
MISC--: essentially bandit algorithm needs find needle haystack each algorithm there inputs performs badly random guessing
MISC--: bandit problems large sets arms been active area investigation past decade see section discussion related literature
MISC--: common theme works assume certain structure payoff functions
MISC--: assumptions this type natural many applications often lead efficient learning algorithms citation

OWNX--: furthermore we assume similarity information available both context arms
MISC--: following work citation non contextual bandits particularly simple way represent similarity information contextual bandit setting via similarity distance between context arm pairs gives upper bound difference between corresponding payoffs xhdr our model contextual bandits similarity information contextual bandits framework defined follows
MISC--: let symbol context set symbol arms set let symbol set feasible context arms pairs
OWNX--: each round symbol following events happen succession context symbol revealed algorithm algorithm chooses arm symbol symbol payoff reward symbol revealed
OWNX--: sequence context arrivals symbol fixed before first round does not depend subsequent choices algorithm
MISC--: stochastic payoffs each pair symbol there distribution symbol expectation symbol so symbol independent sample symbol
OWNX--: adversarial payoffs this distribution change round round
AIMX--: simplicity we present subsequent definitions stochastic setting only whereas adversarial setting fleshed out later paper section omit here symbol payoff function defined independent random sample some fixed distribution symbol over functions symbol general goal bandit algorithm maximize total payoff symbol where symbol time horizon
OWNX--: contextual mab setting we benchmark algorithm s performance terms context specific best arm
OWNX--: specifically goal minimize contextual regret context specific best arm more demanding benchmark than best arm used standard context free definition regret
OWNX--: similarity information given algorithm metric space symbol we call similarity space following lipschitz condition holds without loss generality symbol

OWNX--: central topic this paper bfadaptive partitions similarity space adjusted frequently occurring contexts high paying arms so algorithms take advantage problem instances expected payoffs context arrivals benign low dimensional sense we make precise later
OWNX--: we present two main results one stochastic payoffs one adversarial payoffs
OWNX--: stochastic payoffs we provide algorithm called contextual zooming zooms regions context space correspond frequently occurring contexts regions arms space correspond high paying arms
MISC--: unlike algorithms prior work this algorithm considers context space arms space jointly maintains partition similarity space rather than one partition contexts another arms
OWNX--: we develop provable guarantees capture benign ness context arrivals expected payoffs
OWNX--: worst case we match guarantee refeq eq regret naive naivealg
OWNX--: we obtain nearly matching lower bounds using kl divergence techniques citation
MISC--: lower bound very general holds every given product similarity space every fixed value upper bound
MISC--: our stochastic contextual mab setting specifically zoomalg fruitfully applied beyond ad placement scenario described above beyond mab similarity information per se
OWNX--: first writing symbol one incorporate temporal constraints across time each arm combine them spatial constraints across arms each time
MISC--: analysis contextual zooming yields concrete meaningful bounds this scenario
OWNX--: particular we recover one main results citation
BASE--: second our setting subsumes stochastic sleeping bandits problem citation where each round some arms asleep i e not available this round
MISC--: here contexts correspond subsets arms awake
MISC--: contextual zooming recovers generalizes corresponding result citation
AIMX--: third following publication preliminary version this paper contextual zooming been applied bandit learning rank citation omit applies version adversarial mab problem adversary constrained change expected payoffs each arm gradually eg small amount each round
AIMX--: fact we combine significant constraints across time each arm across arms each time omit context free setting our guarantees match those citation
OWNX--: our algorithm analysis extends more general setting where some context arms pairs may unfeasible moreover right hand side refeq eq lipschitzd replaced arbitrary metric feasible context arms pairs omit we apply zoomalg context free adversarial mab problem adversary constrained change expected payoffs each arm gradually eg small amount each round
OWNX--: this setting naturally modeled contextual mab problem symbol th context arrival simply symbol
OWNX--: then symbol corresponds expected payoff arm symbol at time symbol context metric symbol provides upper bound temporal change symbol
OWNX--: we term bf driftproblem
AIMX--: interestingly this problem incorporates significant constraints both across time each arm across arms each time best our knowledge mab models quite rare literature
OWNX--: notable special cases symbol include symbol symbol corresponds respectively bounded change per round high probability behavior random walk
OWNX--: we derive provable guarantees two examples show they essentially optimal
MISC--: interestingly problem subsumes stochastic sleeping bandits problem citation where each round some arms asleep i e not available this round
MISC--: each context arrival symbol corresponds set arms awake this round
MISC--: more precisely contexts symbol correspond subsets symbol arms so only context arm pairs symbol symbol feasible context distance symbol
MISC--: moreover problem extends sleeping bandits setting incorporating similarity information arms
MISC--: zoomalg its analysis applies geared exploit this additional similarity information
MISC--: absence information algorithms essentially reduces highest awake index algorithm citation omit analysis zoomalg carries over driftproblem contextual regret becomes dynamic regret regret respect benchmark each round plays best arm this round
BASE--: this setting quantity interest average dynamic regret typically independent time horizon omit furthermore we consider dynamic mab problem citation state current expected payoff each arm undergoes independent brownian motion symbol interval reflecting boundaries
OWNX--: we treat this problem essentially special case driftproblem symbol where symbol volatility speed change brownian motion
OWNX--: we improve analysis zoomalg obtain guarantees superior those algorithms citation provide nearly matching lower bound adversarial setting we provide algorithm maintains adaptive partition context space thus takes advantage benign context arrivals
OWNX--: we develop provable guarantees capture this benign ness
MISC--: worst case contextual regret bounded terms covering dimension context space matching refeq eq regret naive
CONT--: our algorithm fact meta algorithm given adversarial bandit algorithm bandit we present contextual bandit algorithm calls bandit subroutine
MISC--: our setup flexible depending what additional constraints known about adversarial payoffs one plug bandit algorithm prior work corresponding version adversarial mab so regret bound bandit plugs into overall regret bound omit our setup allows us leverage prior work other adversarial mab formulations basic symbol arm version citation linear payoffs citation convex payoffs citation xhdr discussion adaptive partitions arms space context free mab similarity information been introduced citation
AIMX--: this paper further explores potential zooming technique citation
MISC--: specifically contextual zooming extends this technique adaptive partitions entire similarity space necessitates technically different algorithm more delicate analysis
OWNX--: we obtain clean algorithm contextual mab improved nearly optimal bounds
MISC--: moreover this algorithm applies several other seemingly unrelated problems unifies some results prior work
OWNX--: one alternative approach maintain partition context space run separate instance zooming algorithm citation each set this partition
CONT--: fleshing out this idea leads meta algorithm we present adversarial payoffs bandit being zooming algorithm
OWNX--: this meta algorithm parameterized constrained specific priori regret bound bandit
