AIMX--: this paper introduces model based upon games evolving network develops three clustering algorithms according
MISC--: clustering algorithms data points clustering regarded players who make decisions games
MISC--: network describing relationships among data points edge removing rewiring err function employed explore neighborhood data point removes edges connecting neighbors small payoffs creates new edges neighbors larger payoffs
MISC--: connections among data points vary over time
MISC--: during evolution network some strategies spread network
OWNX--: consequence clusters formed automatically data points same evolutionarily stable strategy collected cluster so number evolutionarily stable strategies indicates number clusters
MISC--: moreover experimental results demonstrated data points datasets clustered reasonably efficiently comparison other algorithms also provides indication effectiveness proposed algorithms keywords unsupervised learning data clustering evolutionary game theory evolutionarily stable strategy
MISC--: cluster analysis important branch pattern recognition widely used many fields pattern analysis data mining information retrieval image segmentation
MISC--: past thirty years many excellent clustering algorithms been presented say k means citation c citation support vector clustering svc citation spectral clustering citation etc data points clustering fixed various functions designed find separating hyperplanes
CONT--: recent years however significant change been made
MISC--: some researchers thought about why not those data points could move themselves just like agents something collect together automatically
MISC--: therefore following their ideas they created few exciting algorithms citation data points move space according certain simple local rules preset advance
MISC--: game theory came into being book named theory games economic behavior john von neumann oskar morgenstern citation
OWNX--: this period cooperative game was widely studied
MISC--: till s john nash published two well known papers present theory non cooperative game he proposed concept nash equilibrium proved existence equilibrium finite non cooperative game citation
MISC--: although non cooperative game was established rigorous mathematics required players game must perfect rational even hyper rational
MISC--: if this assumption could not hold nash equilibrium might not reached sometimes
MISC--: other hand evolutionary game theory citation stems researches biology analyze conflict cooperation between animals plants
MISC--: differs classical game theory focusing dynamics strategy change more than properties strategy equilibria does not require perfect rational players
MISC--: besides important concept evolutionarily stable strategy citation evolutionary game theory was defined introduced john maynard smith george r
OWNX--: price was often used explain evolution social behavior animals
OWNX--: best our knowledge problem data clustering not been investigated based evolutionary game theory
MISC--: so if data points dataset considered players games could clusters formed automatically playing games among them
OWNX--: this question we attempt answer
OWNX--: our clustering algorithm each player hopes maximize his own payoff so he constantly adjusts his strategies observing neighbors payoffs
MISC--: course strategies evolving some strategies spread network players
OWNX--: finally some parts will formed automatically each same strategy used
MISC--: according different strategies played data points dataset naturally collected several different clusters
AIMX--: remainder this paper organized follows section introduces some basic concepts methods about evolutionary game theory evolutionary game graph
OWNX--: section model based upon games evolving network proposed described specifically
OWNX--: section gives three algorithms based this model algorithms elaborated analyzed detail
OWNX--: section introduces those datasets used experiments briefly then demonstrates experimental results algorithms
MISC--: further relationship between number clusters number nearest neighbors discussed three edge removing rewiring err functions employed clustering algorithms compared
OWNX--: conclusion given section
