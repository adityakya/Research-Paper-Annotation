OWNX--: we study problem dynamic spectrum sensing access cognitive radio systems partially observed markov decision process pomdp
OWNX--: group cognitive users cooperatively tries exploit vacancies primary licensed channels whose occupancies follow markovian evolution
OWNX--: we first consider scenario where cognitive users perfect knowledge distribution signals they receive primary users
MISC--: this problem we obtain greedy channel selection access policy maximizes instantaneous reward while satisfying constraint probability interfering licensed transmissions
OWNX--: we also derive analytical universal upper bound performance optimal policy
OWNX--: through simulation we show our scheme achieves good performance relative upper bound improved performance relative existing scheme
OWNX--: we then consider more practical scenario where exact distribution signal primary unknown
MISC--: we assume parametric model distribution develop algorithm learn true distribution still guaranteeing constraint interference probability
OWNX--: we show this algorithm outperforms naive design assumes worst case value parameter
OWNX--: we also provide proof convergence learning algorithm
OWNX--: cognitive radios exploit vacancies licensed spectrum been proposed solution ever increasing demand radio spectrum
CONT--: idea sense times when specific licensed band not used at particular place use this band unlicensed transmissions without causing interference licensed user referred primary
MISC--: important part designing systems develop efficient channel selection policy
OWNX--: cognitive radio also called secondary user needs adopt best strategy selecting channels sensing access
MISC--: sensing access policies should jointly ensure probability interfering primary s transmission meets given constraint
OWNX--: first part this paper we consider design joint sensing access policy assuming markovian model primary spectrum usage channels being monitored
MISC--: secondary users use observations made each slot track probability occupancy different channels
OWNX--: we obtain suboptimal solution resultant pomdp problem
AIMX--: second part paper we propose study more practical problem arises when secondary users not aware exact distribution signals they receive primary transmitters
OWNX--: we develop algorithm learns unknown statistics show this scheme gives improved performance over naive scheme assumes worst case value unknown distribution
