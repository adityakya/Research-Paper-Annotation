MISC--: engine assembly complex heavily automated distributed control process large amounts faults data logged everyday
OWNX--: we describe application temporal data mining analyzing fault logs engine assembly plant
OWNX--: frequent episode discovery framework model free method used deduce temporal correlations among events logs efficient manner
MISC--: addition being theoretically elegant computationally efficient frequent episodes also easy interpret form actionable recommendations
MISC--: incorporation domain specific information critical successful application method analyzing fault logs manufacturing domain
AIMX--: we show how domain specific knowledge incorporated using heuristic rules act pre filters post filters frequent episode discovery
MISC--: system described here currently being used one engine assembly plants general motors planned adaptation other plants
OWNX--: best our knowledge this paper presents first real large scale application temporal data mining manufacturing domain
AIMX--: we believe ideas presented this paper help practitioners engineer tools analysis other similar related application domains well
MISC--: automotive engine assembly heavily automated complex process controlled distributed fashion
MISC--: each assembly plant consists several machines operations stations extensively inter connected programmed automatically execute various operations necessary manufacture automotive engine
OWNX--: distributed control system maintains elaborate logs regarding time evolving conditions all machines plant status different operations performed particular engine throughput statistics plant etc
AIMX--: this paper we present application uses temporal data mining techniques analyzing time stamped logs help fault analysis root cause diagnosis
MISC--: application presented here currently being used regular basis engine assembly plants general motors
