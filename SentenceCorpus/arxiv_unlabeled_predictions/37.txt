OWNX--: cross entropy method ce developed r
MISC--: rubinstein elegant practical principle simulating rare events
MISC--: method approximates probability rare event means family probabilistic models
OWNX--: method been extended optimization considering optimal event rare event
MISC--: ce works rather good when dealing deterministic function optimization
MISC--: now appears two conditions needed good convergence method
MISC--: first necessary family models sufficiently flexible discriminating optimal events
MISC--: indirectly appears also function optimized should deterministic
AIMX--: purpose this paper consider case partially discriminating model family stochastic functions
MISC--: will shown simple examples ce could fail when relaxing hypotheses
OWNX--: alternative improvements ce method investigated compared random examples order handle this issue
OWNX--: cross entropy method been developed r
MISC--: rubinstein simulation rare events citation
MISC--: algorithm iteratively builds near optimal importance sampling rare event based family parameterized sampling laws
MISC--: construction importance sampling obtained iteratively tossing samples selecting samples approximating rare events relearning parameters sampling law minimizing its kulback leiber distance cross entropy selection computing importance weightings
OWNX--: considering optimal events related objective rare events method been extended optimization problems pt cross entropy method been implemented successfully many combinatorial problems
OWNX--: however attempted proofs method make some assumptions preliminary requests citation
OWNX--: first proof been made deterministic context
OWNX--: secondly closure simulation law family should contain dirac optimum laws support optimums pt first condition cannot fulfilled properly case stochastic problem
MISC--: second condition obvious requirement
MISC--: but there some cases where not possible handle all solutions precisely law family
OWNX--: indeed solutions may not countable practically this typically case some dynamic problems example strategy tree against deterministic computer chess player
MISC--: both difficulties encountered optimal planning partial observation
OWNX--: purpose this paper point out simple examples hypotheses necessary convergence classical ce method
MISC--: questions does emph classical ce algorithm solve stochastic problems properly appears quantile selection within ce may not work properly without rather good estimation objective functional expectation
MISC--: nevertheless smoother selection criteria seem possible answer difficulties
MISC--: assume law family closure does not contain all deterministic solutions
MISC--: ce algorithm will converge stochastic approximation optimal solution
OWNX--: this approximation best possible within law family
OWNX--: our answer this question not absolutely negative
MISC--: but appears some extensions ce quite usually implemented will fail this question
AIMX--: this paper presents some counterexamples questions
OWNX--: case stochastic optimization tests done simple random examples order compare convergence various ce methods global optimum pt next section introduces shortly principle ce method
OWNX--: section will consider case where optimal solution not caught properly sampling family
OWNX--: counterexample proposed studied
MISC--: section stochastic problems considered
MISC--: two simple counterexamples investigated thus enlightening some typical convergence difficulties
OWNX--: different evolutions cross entropy then compared basical method generating several random examples
OWNX--: particular method smooth sample selection proposed possible alternative stochastic problems
OWNX--: section concludes
