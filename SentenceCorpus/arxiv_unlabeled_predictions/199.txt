OWNX--: we report new optimal resolution statistical stratification problem under proportional sampling allocation among strata
MISC--: consider finite population n units random sample n units selected this population number l strata
OWNX--: thus we define units belong each stratum so minimize variance total estimator one desired variable interest each stratum consequently reduce overall variance quantity
OWNX--: order solve this problem exact algorithm based concept minimal path graph proposed assessed
MISC--: computational results using real data ibge brazilian central statistical office provided em keywords stratification proportional allocation variance minimal path
MISC--: common procedure sampling surveys partitioning elements population before distributing sample way obtain most useful information data collected
MISC--: this procedure called stratification
MISC--: may different aims guarantee obtaining information some all geopolitical regions country provide more precision estimating population quantities identifying strata more homogeneous elements into them according one more variables
MISC--: this latter case stratification also called statistical stratification
OWNX--: principal use statistical stratification order obtain better precision defining what percentage sample must taken each stratum once we chosen non uniform allocation scheme non trivial functional relation between size each stratum number sample units collected
MISC--: thus important consider allocation scheme itself order do suitable statistical stratification
AIMX--: this paper we propose exact algorithm solve statistical stratification problem we call simply stratification problem considering simple non uniform allocation scheme
OWNX--: specifically this method intends solve problem optimal stratification stratified simple random sampling without replacement citation using proportional allocation
OWNX--: this problem we must divide population size symbol into symbol strata considering auxiliary variable symbol also called size variable whose values known all units population
MISC--: first stratum defined set units population whose symbol values lower than equal constant value symbol second one set units whose symbol values greater than symbol lower than equal symbol so
MISC--: based this definition stratum symbol symbol defined set units population values symbol belonging interval symbol where symbol boundaries each stratum stratum symbol corresponds set observations values greater than symbol
MISC--: problem optimal stratification consists find boundaries symbol minimize variance estimator total one more variables symbol study supposed some correlation symbol variable even symbol variable properly
CONT--: aiming solve this problem new algorithm when proportional allocation used proposed using idea minimal path graphs citation
AIMX--: this paper organized five sections
OWNX--: section we present some basic concepts about stratified simple random sampling
OWNX--: section we define problem stratification tackled this work offer brief discussion about different approaches this topic
OWNX--: we propose section algorithm based graph theory order provide exact solutions stratification problem defined section
OWNX--: finally we present some computational results considerations about new algorithm
