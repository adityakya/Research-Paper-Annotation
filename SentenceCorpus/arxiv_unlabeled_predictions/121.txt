OWNX--: problem recovering high dimensional sparse signal based small number measurements possibly corrupted noise attracted much recent attention
MISC--: this problem arises many different settings including model selection linear regression constructive approximation inverse problems compressive sensing
OWNX--: suppose we symbol observations form y f z where matrix symbol symbol given symbol vector measurement errors
MISC--: goal reconstruct unknown vector symbol
OWNX--: depending settings error vector symbol either zero noiseless case bounded gaussian where symbol
OWNX--: now well understood symbol minimization provides effective way reconstructing sparse signal all three settings
MISC--: special case particular interest when no noise present symbol
MISC--: this underdetermined system linear equations more variables than number equations
MISC--: clear problem ill posed there generally infinite many solutions
OWNX--: however many applications vector symbol known sparse nearly sparse sense contains only small number nonzero entries
MISC--: this sparsity assumption fundamentally changes problem making unique solution possible
MISC--: indeed many cases unique sparse solution found exactly through symbol minimization p min mbox subject f y
MISC--: this symbol minimization problem been studied example fuchs citation candes tao citation donoho citation
MISC--: understanding noiseless case not only significant interest its own right also provides deep insight into problem reconstructing sparse signals noisy case
MISC--: see example candes tao citation donoho citation
MISC--: when noise present there two well known symbol minimization methods
MISC--: one symbol minimization under symbol constraint residuals p min mbox subject y f gamma epsilon
MISC--: writing terms lagrangian function symbol this closely related finding solution symbol regularized least squares min left y f gamma rho right
MISC--: latter often called lasso statistics literature tibshirani citation
MISC--: tropp citation gave detailed treatment symbol regularized least squares problem
MISC--: another method called dantzig selector recently proposed candes tao citation
MISC--: dantzig selector solves sparse recovery problem through symbol minimization constraint correlation between residuals column vectors symbol symbol candes tao citation showed dantzig selector computed solving linear program mimics performance oracle procedure up logarithmic factor symbol
CONT--: clear regularity conditions needed order problems well behaved
MISC--: over last few years many interesting results recovering sparse signals been obtained framework restricted isometry property rip
MISC--: their seminal work citation candes tao considered sparse recovery problems rip framework
MISC--: they provided beautiful solutions problem under some conditions restricted isometry constant restricted orthogonality constant defined section
MISC--: several different conditions been imposed various settings
AIMX--: this paper we consider symbol minimization methods sparse recovery problem three cases noiseless bounded error gaussian noise
MISC--: both dantzig selector ds symbol minimization under symbol constraint symbol considered
OWNX--: we give unified elementary treatment two methods under three noise settings
OWNX--: our results improve existing results citation weakening conditions tightening error bounds
OWNX--: all cases we solve problems under weaker condition symbol where symbol sparsity index symbol symbol respectively restricted isometry constant restricted orthogonality constant defined section
OWNX--: improvement condition shows signals larger support recovered
OWNX--: although our main interest recovering sparse signals we state results general setting reconstructing arbitrary signal
OWNX--: another widely used condition sparse recovery so called mutual incoherence property mip requires pairwise correlations among column vectors symbol small
MISC--: see citation
OWNX--: we establish connections between concepts rip mip
OWNX--: application we present improvement recent result donoho elad temlyakov citation
AIMX--: paper organized follows

OWNX--: our result improves main result candes tao citation using weaker conditions providing tighter error bounds
MISC--: analysis noiseless case provides insight case when observations contaminated noise
