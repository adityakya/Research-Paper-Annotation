OWNX--: we consider agent interacting unmodeled environment
MISC--: at each time agent makes observation takes action incurs cost
MISC--: its actions influence future observations costs
MISC--: goal minimize long term average cost
OWNX--: we propose novel algorithm known active lz algorithm optimal control based ideas lempel ziv scheme universal data compression prediction
OWNX--: we establish under active lz algorithm if there exists integer symbol future conditionally independent past given window symbol consecutive actions observations then average cost converges optimum
OWNX--: experimental results involving game rock paper scissors illustrate merits algorithm
OWNX--: ieeeparstart c onsider agent at each integer time symbol makes observation symbol finite observation space symbol takes action symbol selected finite action space symbol
MISC--: agent incurs bounded cost symbol
MISC--: goal minimize long term average cost symbol here expectation over randomness symbol process at each time symbol action symbol selected function prior observations symbol prior actions symbol
OWNX--: we will propose general action selection strategy called active lz algorithm
OWNX--: addition new strategy primary contribution this paper theoretical guarantee this strategy attains optimal average cost under weak assumptions about environment
MISC--: main assumption there exists integer symbol future conditionally independent past given window symbol consecutive actions observations
MISC--: other words symbol where symbol transition kernel symbol symbol algebra generated symbol
MISC--: we particularly interested situations where neither symbol nor even symbol known agent
MISC--: where there finite but unknown dependence history
OWNX--: consider following examples fall into above formalism
MISC--: optimization problem find sequence functions symbol where each function symbol specifies encoder at time symbol so minimize long term average distortion symbol assume source markov order symbol but both transition probabilities source order symbol unknown
OWNX--: setting symbol define observation at time symbol vector symbol action at time symbol symbol
OWNX--: then optimal coding problem at hand falls within our framework cf
MISC--: citation references therein end example knowledge kernel symbol even just order kernel symbol solving average cost optimal policy either examples above via dynamic programming methods relatively straightforward
OWNX--: this paper develops algorithm without knowledge kernel its order achieves average cost optimality
OWNX--: active lz algorithm we develop consists two broad components
CONT--: first efficient data structure context tree joint process symbol store information relevant predicting observation at time symbol symbol given history available up time symbol action selected at time symbol symbol
OWNX--: our prediction methodology borrows heavily lempel ziv algorithm data compression citation
BASE--: second component our algorithm dynamic programming scheme given probabilistic model determined context tree selects actions so minimize costs over suitably long horizon
OWNX--: absent knowledge order kernel symbol two tasks above building context tree order estimate kernel selecting actions minimize long term costs must done continually tandem creates important tension between exploration exploitation
MISC--: particular one hand algorithm must select actions manner builds accurate context tree
MISC--: other hand desire minimize costs naturally restricts this selection
OWNX--: carefully balancing two tensions our algorithm achieves average cost equal optimal policy full knowledge kernel symbol
MISC--: related problems been considered literature

OWNX--: this algorithm applied our context when symbol known asymptotic optimality guaranteed
MISC--: more recently even dar et al citation present algorithm optimal control partially observable markov decision processes more general setting than what we consider here able establish theoretical bounds convergence time
CONT--: algorithm there however seems difficult unrealistic implement contrast what we present here
MISC--: further relies knowledge constant related amount time homing policy requires achieve equilibrium
MISC--: this constant may challenging estimate
