MISC--: dictionary defines words terms other words
MISC--: definitions tell you meanings words you don t know but only if you know meanings defining words
MISC--: how many words do you need know ones order able learn all rest definitions
OWNX--: we reduced dictionaries their grounding kernels gks about dictionary all other words could defined
MISC--: gk words turned out psycholinguistic correlates they were learned at earlier age more concrete than rest dictionary
OWNX--: but one compress still more gk turns out internal structure strongly connected kernel core kc surrounding layer hierarchy definitional distances derived all way out periphery full dictionary
MISC--: definitional distances too correlated psycholinguistic variables age acquisition concreteness imageability oral written frequency hence perhaps mental lexicon each our heads
OWNX--: category kind thing object event action trait state
MISC--: categorize do right thing eat fight flee mate etc right kind thing
OWNX--: all species acquire categories through trial error sensorimotor induction
OWNX--: we only species also acquire transmit categories through verbal instruction naming defining them
OWNX--: words our dictionaries almost all names categories followed their definitions
OWNX--: principle all categories acquired through verbal definition but we cannot acquire all them way we know meanings some defining words already some other means
MISC--: this symbol grounding problem citation presumably other means acquiring categories sensorimotor induction
OWNX--: but how many words ones need grounded directly through sensorimotor induction order allow all rest acquired through verbal definition
OWNX--: we been analyzing dictionaries order answer this question
OWNX--: eliminating all words reached other words through definition alone we been able reduce dictionary its grounding kernel gk set words about symbol out all rest words reached through definition alone citation
MISC--: gk some striking properties words learned at significantly younger age than rest dictionary also more concrete citation but if variance correlated age removed residual gk words more abstract than rest dictionary
OWNX--: what cause this polarity shift
OWNX--: gk unique sufficient ground all rest dictionary but not minimal not smallest set words all rest reached via definition alone
MISC--: would minimum grounding set mgs not general unique we not yet been able compute mgs because this problem equivalent finding minimum cardinality feedback vertex set general graph np complete i e too hard compute general
OWNX--: we hope able compute mgss our special cases but meanwhile gks our dictionaries cambridge international dictionary english cide citation longman dictionary contemporary english ldoce citation already turn out more differentiated internal substructure we begin analyzing further this article
OWNX--: particular two substructures play important roles gk itself strongly connected subset gk we call kernel core kc
MISC--: gk words acquired earlier more concrete than rest dictionary tend kc whereas gk words uncorrelated age acquisition tend outer layer surrounding kc more abstract
MISC--: correlations between kc rest gk between gk rest dictionary whole binary but one make more graded comparisons considering definitional chains increasing lengths
MISC--: we accordingly extracted two hierarchies based degrees definitional distance one based gk one based strongly connected components analyze how definitional distance correlates age acquisition concreteness abstractness other psycholinguistic variables
