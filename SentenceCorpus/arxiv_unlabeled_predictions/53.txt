OWNX--: this correspondence studies estimator conditional support distribution underlying set iid
MISC--: observations
MISC--: relation mutual information shown via extension fano s theorem combination generalization bound based compression argument
MISC--: extensions estimating conditional quantile interval statistical guarantees minimal convex hull given keywords statistical learning fano s inequality mutual information support vector machines
MISC--: given set paired observations symbol iid
MISC--: copies random vector symbol possessing fixed but unknown joint distribution symbol this letter concerns question values random variable symbol possibly likely take given covariate symbol
MISC--: this investigation predictive tolerance intervals motivated one often interested other characteristics joint distribution than conditional expectation regression eg econometrics one often more interested volatility market than its precise prediction
MISC--: environmental sciences one typically concerned extremal behavior i e min max value magnitude its respective conditioning related environmental variables
MISC--: main contribution this letter extension fano s classical inequality see eg citation p gives lower bound mutual information two random variables
MISC--: this classical result extended towards setting learning theory where random variables arbitrary fixed distribution
MISC--: derivation yields non parametric estimator mutual information possessing probabilistic guarantee derived using classical compression argument
MISC--: described relationship differs other results relating estimators mutual information eg using fisher s information matrix citation based gaussian assumptions eg citation distribution free context adopted
MISC--: aside i estimator conditional support derived extended setting conditional quantiles ii its theoretical properties derived iii relation method minimal convex hull made explicit iv shown how estimate computed efficiently solving linear program
MISC--: while studied literature eg quantile regression citation we argue this question approached naturally setting statistical learning theory pattern recognition support vector machines svm see citation overview
MISC--: main conceptual difference existing literature classical regression other predictor methods no attempt made whatsoever reveal underlying conditional mean regression conditional quantile quantile regression minimal risk point prediction dependent variable pattern recognition
OWNX--: here we target instead change rough contour conditional distribution
OWNX--: this implies one becomes interested i what extent estimated conditional support tube conservative i e does overestimate actual conditional support ii what probability covering actual conditional support i e what probability new sample occur outside estimated interval section ii proofs main result explores relation convex hull
OWNX--: practical perspective section iii provides further insight how optimal estimate found efficiently solving linear program
