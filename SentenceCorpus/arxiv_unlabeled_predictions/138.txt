CONT--: previous studies multi instance learning typically treated instances bags independently identically distributed
CONT--: instances bag however rarely independent real tasks better performance expected if instances treated non iid
MISC--: way exploits relations among instances
AIMX--: this paper we propose two simple yet effective methods
OWNX--: first method we explicitly map every bag undirected graph design graph kernel distinguishing positive negative bags
OWNX--: second method we implicitly construct graphs deriving affinity matrices propose efficient graph kernel considering clique information
MISC--: effectiveness proposed methods validated experiments
MISC--: multi instance learning citation each training example bag instances
OWNX--: bag positive if contains at least one positive instance negative otherwise
MISC--: although labels training bags known however labels instances bags unknown
MISC--: goal construct learner classify unseen bags
MISC--: multi instance learning been found useful diverse domains image categorization citation image retrieval citation text categorization citation computer security citation face detection citation computer aided medical diagnosis citation etc
MISC--: prominent advantage multi instance learning mainly lies fact many real objects inherent structures adopting multi instance representation we able represent objects more naturally capture more information than simply using flat single instance representation
OWNX--: example suppose we partition image into several parts
MISC--: contrast representing whole image single instance if we represent each part instance then partition information captured multi instance representation if partition meaningful e g each part corresponds region saliency additional information captured multi instance representation may helpful make learning task easier deal
MISC--: obviously not good idea apply multi instance learning techniques everywhere since if single instance representation sufficient using multi instance representation just gilds lily
MISC--: even tasks where objects inherent structures we should keep mind power multi instance representation exists its ability capturing some structure information
CONT--: however zhou xu citation indicated previous studies multi instance learning typically treated instances bags independently identically distributed this neglects fact relations among instances convey important structure information
MISC--: considering above image task again treating different image parts inter correlated samples evidently more meaningful than treating them unrelated samples
MISC--: actually instances bag rarely independent better performance expected if instances treated non iid
MISC--: way exploits relations among instances
AIMX--: this paper we propose two multi instance learning methods do not treat instances iid
MISC--: samples
OWNX--: our basic idea regard each bag entity processed whole regard instances inter correlated components entity
MISC--: experiments show our proposed methods achieve performances highly competitive state art multi instance learning methods
AIMX--: rest this paper organized follows
OWNX--: we briefly review related work section propose new methods section report our experiments section conclude paper finally section
