OWNX--: we study problem online regression
OWNX--: we do not make any assumptions about input vectors outcomes
OWNX--: we prove theoretical bound square loss ridge regression
OWNX--: we also show bayesian ridge regression thought online algorithm competing all gaussian linear experts
OWNX--: we then consider case infinite dimensional hilbert spaces prove relative loss bounds popular non parametric kernelized bayesian ridge regression kernelized ridge regression
OWNX--: our main theoretical guarantees form equalities
OWNX--: online prediction framework we provided some input at each step try predict outcome using this input information previous steps citation
OWNX--: simple case statistics assumed each outcome value corrupted gaussian noise linear function input
MISC--: competitive prediction learner compares his loss at each step loss any expert certain class experts instead making statistical assumptions about data generating process
MISC--: experts may follow certain strategies
OWNX--: learner wishes predict almost well best expert all sequences
OWNX--: our main result theorem next section
MISC--: compares cumulative weighted square loss ridge regression
MISC--: applied line mode
MISC--: regularized cumulative loss best linear predictor
MISC--: power this result best appreciated looking at range its implications
MISC--: both known new
MISC--: example corollary answers question
MISC--: asked several researchers see citation
MISC--: whether ridge regression relative loss bound
MISC--: regret term order symbol under square loss function
MISC--: where symbol number steps outcomes assumed bounded
OWNX--: this corollary well all other implications stated section
MISC--: explicit inequality rather than asymptotic result
MISC--: theorem itself much stronger
MISC--: stating equality
MISC--: rather than inequality
MISC--: not assuming outcomes bounded
MISC--: since equality unites upper lower bounds loss
MISC--: appears all natural bounds square loss ridge regression
OWNX--: easily deduced our theorem we give some examples next section
MISC--: most previous research online prediction considers experts disregard
MISC--: presence noise observations
OWNX--: we consider experts predicting
MISC--: distribution outcomes
OWNX--: we use
OWNX--: bayesian ridge regression prove predict well best
OWNX--: regularized expert this our theorem
OWNX--: loss this theoretical guarantee logarithmic
MISC--: loss
OWNX--: algorithm we apply was first used
MISC--: citation
MISC--: similar bounds ours were obtained citation
OWNX--: theorem later used deduce theorem
MISC--: ridge regression predicts mean bayesian ridge regression predictive distribution
MISC--: logarithmic loss bayesian ridge regression close scaled square loss
MISC--: ridge regression
OWNX--: we extend our main result case infinite dimensional
MISC--: hilbert spaces functions
OWNX--: algorithm used becomes analogue
MISC--: non parametric bayesian methods
OWNX--: theorem theorem we deduce relative loss bounds
MISC--: logarithmic loss kernelized bayesian ridge regression square
MISC--: loss kernelized ridge regression comparison loss any function
MISC--: reproducing kernel hilbert space
MISC--: both bounds form equalities
MISC--: there lot research done prove upper lower relative loss bounds under different loss functions
MISC--: if outcomes assumed bounded strongest known theoretical guarantees square loss given citation citation algorithm we call vaw vovk azoury warmuth following citation
OWNX--: this not apt name since ridge regression also special case aggregating algorithm corresponding logarithmic loss function learning rate we will call this algorithm vovk azoury warmuth vaw algorithm following citation
OWNX--: case when inputs outcomes not restricted any way like our main guarantees possible prove certain loss bounds gradient descent
MISC--: see citation
OWNX--: section this paper we present online regression framework main theoretical guarantee square loss ridge regression
OWNX--: section describes what we call bayesian algorithm
OWNX--: section we show bayesian ridge regression competitive experts take into account presence noise observations
OWNX--: section we prove main theorem
