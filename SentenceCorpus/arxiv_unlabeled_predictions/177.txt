MISC--: many ai researchers cognitive scientists argued analogy core cognition
MISC--: most influential work computational modeling analogy making structure mapping theory smt its implementation structure mapping engine sme
MISC--: limitation sme requirement complex hand coded representations
OWNX--: we introduce latent relation mapping engine lrme combines ideas sme latent relational analysis lra order remove requirement hand coded representations
MISC--: lrme builds analogical mappings between lists words using large corpus raw text automatically discover semantic relations among words
OWNX--: we evaluate lrme set twenty analogical mapping problems ten based scientific analogies ten based common metaphors
MISC--: lrme achieves human level performance twenty problems
OWNX--: we compare lrme variety alternative approaches find they not able reach same level performance
AIMX--: when we faced problem we try recall similar problems we faced past so we transfer our knowledge past experience current problem
OWNX--: we make analogy between past situation current situation we use analogy transfer knowledge shortcite gentner minsky holyoak hofstadter hawkins
MISC--: his survey computational modeling analogy making french citation cites structure mapping theory smt shortcite gentner its implementation structure mapping engine sme citation most influential work modeling analogy making
OWNX--: sme analogical mapping symbol source symbol target symbol
MISC--: source more familiar more known more concrete whereas target relatively unfamiliar unknown abstract
OWNX--: analogical mapping used transfer knowledge source target
MISC--: gentner citation argues there two kinds similarity attributional similarity relational similarity
MISC--: distinction between attributes relations may understood terms predicate logic
MISC--: attribute predicate one argument large symbol meaning symbol large
MISC--: relation predicate two more arguments collides symbol meaning symbol collides symbol
MISC--: structure mapping engine prefers mappings based relational similarity over mappings based attributional similarity shortcite falkenhainer
MISC--: example sme able build mapping representation solar system source representation rutherford bohr model atom target
MISC--: sun mapped nucleus planets mapped electrons mass mapped charge
OWNX--: note this mapping emphasizes relational similarity
MISC--: sun nucleus very different terms their attributes sun very large nucleus very small
MISC--: likewise planets electrons little attributional similarity
MISC--: other hand planets revolve around sun like electrons revolve around nucleus
MISC--: mass sun attracts mass planets like charge nucleus attracts charge electrons
MISC--: gentner citation provides evidence children rely primarily attributional similarity mapping gradually switching over relational similarity they mature
MISC--: she uses terms mere appearance refer mapping based mostly attributional similarity analogy refer mapping based mostly relational similarity literal similarity refer mixture attributional relational similarity
OWNX--: since we use analogical mappings solve problems make predictions we should focus structure especially causal relations look beyond surface attributes things shortcite gentner
MISC--: analogy between solar system rutherford bohr model atom illustrates importance going beyond mere appearance underlying structures
OWNX--: figures show lisp representations used sme input analogy between solar system atom shortcite falkenhainer
MISC--: chalmers french hofstadter citation criticize sme s requirement complex hand coded representations
MISC--: they argue most hard work done human who creates high level hand coded representations rather than sme gentner forbus their colleagues attempted avoid hand coding their recent work sme
MISC--: cogsketch system generate lisp representations simple sketches citation
MISC--: gizmo system generate lisp representations qualitative physics models citation
MISC--: learning reader system generate lisp representations natural language text shortcite forbus
MISC--: systems do not require lisp input
MISC--: however cogsketch user interface requires person who draws sketch identify basic components sketch hand label them terms knowledge base derived opencyc
MISC--: forbus et al citation note opencyc contains more than hand coded concepts they added further hand coded concepts opencyc order support cogsketch
MISC--: gizmo system requires user hand code physical model using methods qualitative physics shortcite yan
MISC--: learning reader uses more than phrasal patterns were derived researchcyc shortcite forbus
OWNX--: evident sme still requires substantial hand coded knowledge
AIMX--: work we present this paper effort avoid complex hand coded representations
OWNX--: our approach combine ideas sme shortcite falkenhainer latent relational analysis lra shortcite turney
OWNX--: we call resulting algorithm latent relation mapping engine lrme
MISC--: we represent semantic relation between two terms using vector elements derived pattern frequencies large corpus raw text
MISC--: because semantic relations automatically derived corpus lrme does not require hand coded representations relations
MISC--: only needs list terms source list terms target
MISC--: given two lists lrme uses corpus build representations relations among terms then constructs mapping between two lists
MISC--: tables show input output lrme analogy between solar system ruther ford bohr model atom
OWNX--: although some human effort involved constructing input lists considerably less effort than sme requires its input contrast figures table scientific analogies analogy between solar system rutherford bohr model atom may seem esoteric but we believe analogy making ubiquitous our daily lives
MISC--: potential practical application this work task identifying semantic roles shortcite gildea
MISC--: since roles relations not attributes appropriate treat semantic role labeling analogical mapping problem
MISC--: example judgement semantic frame contains semantic roles judge evaluee reason statement frame contains roles speaker addressee message topic medium shortcite gildea
OWNX--: task identifying semantic roles automatically label sentences their roles following examples shortcite gildea if we training set labeled sentences testing set unlabeled sentences then we may view task labeling testing sentences problem creating analogical mappings between training sentences sources testing sentences targets
MISC--: table shows how she blames government failing do enough help
MISC--: might mapped they blame company polluting environment
OWNX--: once mapping been found we transfer knowledge form semantic role labels source target section we briefly discuss hypotheses behind design lrme
OWNX--: we then precisely define task performed lrme specific form analogical mapping section
OWNX--: lrme builds latent relational analysis lra hence we summarize lra section
OWNX--: we discuss potential applications lrme section
OWNX--: evaluate lrme we created twenty analogical mapping problems ten science analogy problems shortcite holyoak ten common metaphor problems shortcite lakoff
MISC--: table one science analogy problems
OWNX--: our intended solution given table
OWNX--: validate our intended solutions we gave our colleagues lists terms table asked them generate mappings between lists
OWNX--: section presents results this experiment
OWNX--: across twenty problems average agreement our intended solutions table was
OWNX--: lrme algorithm outlined section along its evaluation twenty mapping problems
MISC--: lrme achieves accuracy
MISC--: difference between this performance human average not statistically significant
OWNX--: section examines variety alternative approaches analogy mapping task
OWNX--: best approach achieves accuracy but this approach requires hand coded part speech tags
MISC--: this performance significantly below lrme human performance
OWNX--: section we discuss some questions raised results preceding sections
OWNX--: related work described section future work limitations considered section we conclude section
