OWNX--: fundamental problem artificial intelligence nobody really knows what intelligence
OWNX--: problem especially acute when we need consider artificial systems significantly different humans
OWNX--: this paper we approach this problem following way we take number well known informal definitions human intelligence been given experts extract their essential features
MISC--: then mathematically formalised produce general measure intelligence arbitrary machines
OWNX--: we believe this measure formally captures concept machine intelligence broadest reasonable sense
OWNX--: most us think we recognise intelligence when we see but we not really sure how precisely define measure
OWNX--: we informally judge intelligence others relying our past experiences dealing people
OWNX--: naturally this naive approach highly subjective imprecise
MISC--: more principled approach would use one many standard intelligence tests available
MISC--: contrary popular wisdom tests when correctly applied professional deliver statistically consistent results considerable power predict future performance individuals many mentally demanding tasks
CONT--: however while tests work well humans if we wish measure intelligence other things perhaps monkey new machine learning algorithm they clearly inappropriate
CONT--: one response this problem might develop specific kinds tests specific kinds entities just intelligence tests children differ intelligence tests adults
MISC--: while this works well when testing humans different ages comes undone when we need measure intelligence entities profoundly different each other terms their cognitive capacities speed senses environments they operate so
OWNX--: measure intelligence diverse systems meaningful way we must step back specifics particular systems establish underlying fundamentals what we really trying measure
OWNX--: we need establish notion intelligence goes beyond specifics particular kinds systems
MISC--: difficulty doing this readily apparent
MISC--: consider example memory numerical computation tasks appear some intelligence tests were once regarded defining hallmarks human intelligence
OWNX--: we now know tasks absolutely trivial machine thus do not test machine s intelligence
MISC--: indeed even mentally demanding task playing chess been largely reduced brute force search
OWNX--: technology advances our concept what intelligence continues evolve
OWNX--: how then we develop concept intelligence applicable all kinds systems
MISC--: any proposed definition must encompass essence human intelligence well other possibilities consistent way
CONT--: should not limited any particular set senses environments goals nor should limited any specific kind hardware silicon biological neurons
MISC--: should based principles sufficiently fundamental so unlikely alter over time
MISC--: furthermore intelligence measure should ideally formally expressed objective practically realisable
AIMX--: this paper approaches this problem following way
OWNX--: section we consider range definitions human intelligence been put forward well known psychologists
OWNX--: we extract most common essential features use them create informal definition intelligence
OWNX--: section then introduces framework we use construct our formal measure intelligence
OWNX--: this framework formally defined section
OWNX--: section we use our developed formalism produce formal definition intelligence
OWNX--: section closes short summary
AIMX--: preliminary sketch ideas this paper appeared poster citation
MISC--: shown intelligence measure presented here fact variant intelligence order relation appears theory aixi provably optimal universal agent citation
AIMX--: long journal version this paper being written we give proposed measure machine intelligence its relation other tests much more comprehensive treatment
OWNX--: naturally we expect bold initiative met resistance
OWNX--: however we hope reader will appreciate value our approach formally precise definition put forward we aim better our understanding what notoriously subjective slippery concept
