OWNX--: method topological grammars proposed multidimensional data approximation
OWNX--: data complex topology we define principal cubic complex low dimension given complexity gives best approximation dataset
MISC--: this complex generalization linear non linear principal manifolds includes them particular cases
MISC--: problem optimal principal complex construction transformed into series minimization problems quadratic functionals
MISC--: quadratic functionals physically transparent interpretation terms elastic energy
MISC--: energy computation whole complex represented system nodes springs
MISC--: topologically principal complex product one dimensional continuums represented graphs grammars describe how continuums transform during process optimal complex construction

OWNX--: this paper we discuss classical problem how approximate finite set symbol symbol relatively large symbol finite subset regular low dimensional object symbol
MISC--: application this finite set dataset this problem arises many areas data visualization fluid dynamics
OWNX--: first hypothesis we check whether dataset symbol situated near low dimensional affine manifold plane symbol
OWNX--: if we look point straight line plane

OWNX--: minimizes average squared distance datapoints we immediately come principal component analysis pca
MISC--: pca one most seminal inventions data analysis
MISC--: now textbook material
MISC--: nonlinear generalization pca great challenge many attempts been made answer
OWNX--: two them especially important our consideration kohonen s self organizing maps som principal manifolds
OWNX--: som algorithm citation we take finite metric space symbol metric symbol try map into symbol best preservation initial structure image symbol b best approximation dataset symbol
MISC--: som algorithm several setup variables regulate compromise between goals
OWNX--: we start some initial approximation map symbol

MISC--: there many ways combine steps whole algorithm
AIMX--: idea som very flexible seminal plenty applications generalizations but strictly speaking we don t know what we looking we algorithm but no independent definition som result algorithm work
MISC--: attempts define som solution minimization problem some energy functional were not very successful citation
MISC--: known probability distribution principal manifolds were introduced lines surfaces passing through middle data distribution citation
MISC--: this intuitive vision was transformed into mathematical notion self consistency every point symbol principal manifold symbol conditional expectation all points symbol projected into symbol
MISC--: neither manifold nor projection should linear just differentiable projection symbol data space usually symbol domain symbol onto manifold symbol self consistency requirement conditional expectations symbol finite dataset symbol only one zero datapoints typically projected into point principal manifold
MISC--: order avoid overfitting we introduce smoothers become essential part principal manifold construction algorithms
MISC--: soms give most popular approximations principal manifolds we take symbol fragment regular symbol dimensional grid consider resulting som approximation symbol dimensional principal manifold see example citation
MISC--: several original algorithms construction principal curves citation surfaces finite datasets were developed during last decade well many applications this idea
MISC--: discussion about som at th russian national seminar neuroinformatics method multidimensional data approximation based elastic energy minimization was proposed see citation bibliography there
OWNX--: this method based analogy between principal manifold elastic membrane plate
OWNX--: following metaphor elasticity we introduce two quadratic smoothness penalty terms
