MISC--: ordinal regression important type learning properties both classification regression
MISC--: here we describe simple effective approach adapt traditional neural network learn ordinal categories
OWNX--: our approach generalization perceptron method ordinal regression
OWNX--: several benchmark datasets our method nnrank outperforms neural network classification method
OWNX--: compared ordinal regression methods using gaussian processes support vector machines nnrank achieves comparable performance

MISC--: ordinal regression ranking learning important supervised problem learning ranking ordering instances property both classification metric regression
MISC--: learning task ordinal regression assign data points into set finite ordered categories

MISC--: ordinal regression different classification due order categories
MISC--: contrast metric regression response variables categories ordinal regression discrete finite
MISC--: research ordinal regression dated back ordinal statistics methods s mccullagh mccullagh nelder machine learning research s caruana et al herbrich et al cohen et al
MISC--: attracted considerable attention recent years due its potential applications many data intensive domains information retrieval herbrich et al web page ranking joachims collaborative filtering goldberg et al basilico hofmann yu et al image retrieval wu et al protein ranking cheng baldi bioinformatics
MISC--: number machine learning methods been developed redesigned address ordinal regression problem rajaram et al including perceptron crammer singer its kernelized generalization basilico hofmann neural network gradient descent caruana et al burges et al gaussian process chu ghahramani b chu ghahramani schwaighofer et al large margin classifier support vector machine herbrich et al herbrich et al joachims shashua levin chu keerthi aiolli sperduti chu keerthi k partite classifier agarwal roth boosting algorithm freund et al dekel et al constraint classification har peled et al regression trees kramer et al naive bayes zhang et al bayesian hierarchical experts paquet et al binary classification approach frank hall li lin decomposes original ordinal regression problem into set binary classifications optimization nonsmooth cost functions burges et al
MISC--: most methods roughly classified into two categories pairwise constraint approach herbrich et al joachims dekel et al burges et al multi threshold approach crammer singer shashua levin chu ghahramani
MISC--: former convert full ranking relation into pairwise order constraints
MISC--: latter tries learn multiple thresholds divide data into ordinal categories
MISC--: multi threshold approaches also unified under general extended binary classification framework li lin
MISC--: ordinal regression methods different advantages disadvantages
CONT--: prank crammer singer perceptron approach generalizes binary perceptron algorithm ordinal multi class situation fast online algorithm
MISC--: however like standard perceptron method its accuracy suffers when dealing non linear data while quadratic kernel version prank greatly relieves this problem
MISC--: one class accurate large margin classifier approaches herbrich et al joachims convert ordinal relations into symbol symbol number data points pairwise ranking constraints structural risk minimization vapnik schoelkopf smola
OWNX--: thus not applied medium size datasets symbol data points without discarding some pairwise preference relations
MISC--: may also overfit noise due incomparable pairs
MISC--: other class powerful large margin classifier methods shashua levin chu keerthi generalize support vector formulation ordinal regression finding symbol thresholds real line divide data into symbol ordered categories
OWNX--: size this optimization problem linear number training examples
OWNX--: however like support vector machine used classification prediction speed slow when solution not sparse makes not appropriate time critical tasks
OWNX--: similarly another state art approach gaussian process method chu ghahramani also difficulty handling large training datasets problem slow prediction speed some situations
MISC--: here we describe new neural network approach ordinal regression advantages neural network learning learning both online batch mode training very large dataset burges et al handling non linear data good performance rapid prediction
OWNX--: our method considered generalization perceptron learning crammer singer into multi layer perceptrons neural network ordinal regression
OWNX--: our method also related classic generalized linear models e g cumulative logit model ordinal regression mccullagh
OWNX--: unlike neural network method burges et al trained pairs examples learn pairwise order relations our method works individual data points uses multiple output nodes estimate probabilities ordinal categories
OWNX--: thus our method falls into category multi threshold approach
BASE--: learning our method proceeds similarly traditional neural networks using back propagation rumelhart et al
OWNX--: same benchmark datasets our method yields performance better than standard classification neural networks comparable state art methods using support vector machines gaussian processes
OWNX--: addition our method learn very large datasets make rapid predictions
