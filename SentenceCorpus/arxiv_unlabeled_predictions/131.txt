CONT--: remarkable results foster vohra was starting point series papers show any sequence outcomes learned no prior knowledge using some universal randomized forecasting algorithm forecast dependent checking rules
OWNX--: we show class all computationally efficient outcome forecast based checking rules this property violated
OWNX--: moreover we present probabilistic algorithm generating probability close one sequence subsequence simultaneously miscalibrates all partially weakly computable randomized forecasting algorithms
OWNX--: according dawid s prequential framework we consider partial recursive randomized algorithms
OWNX--: let binary sequence symbol outcomes observed forecaster whose task give probability symbol future event symbol
MISC--: evaluation probability forecasts based method called calibration informally following dawid citation forecaster said well calibrated if any symbol event symbol holds symbol moments time he choose symbol see also citation
MISC--: let us give some notations
OWNX--: let symbol set all infinite binary sequences symbol set all finite binary sequences symbol empty sequence
OWNX--: any finite infinite sequence symbol we write symbol we put symbol
MISC--: also symbol denotes length sequence symbol
MISC--: if symbol finite sequence symbol finite infinite sequence then symbol denotes concatenation sequences symbol means symbol some symbol
OWNX--: measure theoretic framework we expect forecaster method assigning probabilities symbol future event symbol all possible finite sequences symbol
