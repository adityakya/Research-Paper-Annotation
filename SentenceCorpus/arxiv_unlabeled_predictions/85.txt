MISC--: 
OWNX--: this context classical data analysis knowledge discovery based calculating center gravity not used because input not symbol vectors
AIMX--: this paper we present application real world symbolic data using self organizing map
AIMX--: this end we propose extension self organizing map handle symbolic data keywords classification self organizing map symbolic data dissimilarity
MISC--: self organizing map som introduced kohonen citation unsupervised neural network method both clustering visualization properties
MISC--: considered algorithm maps high dimensional data space symbol lower dimension generally called map
MISC--: this projection enables input data partitioned into similar clusters while preserving their topology
MISC--: its most similar predecessors k means algorithm citation dynamic clustering method citation operate som without topology preservation therefore without easy visualization
MISC--: data analysis new forms complex data considered most notably symbolic data data internal structure interval data distributions functional data etc semi structured data trees xml documents sql queries etc
OWNX--: this context classical data analysis based calculating center gravity not used because input not symbol vectors
MISC--: order solve this problem several methods considered depending type data example projection operators functional data citation
CONT--: however those methods not fully general adaptation every data analysis algorithm resulting data needed
MISC--: kohonen s som based center gravity notion unfortunately this concept not applicable many kinds complex data
AIMX--: this paper we propose adaptation som dissimilarity data alternative solution
OWNX--: our goal modify som algorithm allow its implementation dissimilarity measures rather than raw data
BASE--: this end we take one s inspiration work kohonen citation
MISC--: apply method only definition dissimilarity each type data necessary so complex data processed
