MISC--: many real world applications data cannot accurately represented vectors
MISC--: those situations one possible solution rely dissimilarity measures enable sensible comparison between observations
MISC--: kohonen s self organizing map som been adapted data described only through their dissimilarity matrix
MISC--: this algorithm provides both non linear projection clustering non vector data
CONT--: unfortunately algorithm suffers high cost makes quite difficult use voluminous data sets
OWNX--: this paper we propose new algorithm provides important reduction theoretical cost dissimilarity som without changing its outcome results exactly same ones obtained original algorithm
AIMX--: moreover we introduce implementation methods result very short running times
OWNX--: improvements deduced theoretical cost model validated simulated real world data word list clustering problem
OWNX--: we also demonstrate proposed implementation methods reduce factor up running time fast algorithm over standard implementation
OWNX--: vast majority currently available data analysis methods based vector model observations described fixed number real values i e vectors fixed finite dimensional vector space
MISC--: unfortunately many real world data depart strongly this model
MISC--: quite common instance variable size data
MISC--: they natural example online handwriting recognition citation where representation character drawn user vary length because drawing conditions
MISC--: other data texts instance strongly non numerical complex internal structure they very difficult represent accurately vector space
MISC--: while lot work been done adapt classical data analysis methods structured data tree graph citation neural based unsupervised processing structured data also citation well data varying size there still strong need efficient flexible data analysis methods applied any type data
MISC--: way design methods rely one one comparison between observations
MISC--: general possible define similarity dissimilarity measure between arbitrary data long comparing them meaningful
MISC--: general data analysis algorithms based solely dis similarities between observations more complex than their vector counterparts but they universal therefore applied any kind data
MISC--: moreover they allow one rely specific dis similarities constructed experts rather than vector representation data induces general unwanted distortion observations
MISC--: many algorithms been adapted use solely dissimilarities between data
MISC--: clustering field k means algorithm citation been adapted dissimilarity data under name partitioning around medoids citation
MISC--: more recently approaches based deterministic annealing been used propose another class extensions k means principle citation
MISC--: following path taken k means several adaptation kohonen s self organizing map citation dissimilarity data been proposed
OWNX--: citation proposed probabilistic formulation som used directly dissimilarity data

AIMX--: present paper we focus adaptation proposed citation where was applied successfully protein sequence clustering visualization problem well string clustering problems
MISC--: this generalization called dissimilarity som dsom also known median som considered som formulation pam method
MISC--: variants dsom were applied temperature time series citation spectrometric data citation web usage data citation
MISC--: major drawback dsom its running time very high especially when compared standard vector som
MISC--: well known som algorithm behaves linearly number input data citation
OWNX--: contrary dsom behaves quadratically this number see section
AIMX--: we propose this paper several modifications basic algorithm allow much faster implementation
MISC--: quadratic nature algorithm cannot avoided essentially because dissimilarity data intrinsically described quadratic number one one dissimilarities
CONT--: nevertheless standard dsom algorithm cost proportional symbol where symbol number observations symbol number clusters algorithm produce whereas our modifications lead cost proportional symbol
MISC--: moreover specific implementation strategy reduces actual computation burden even more
OWNX--: important property all our modifications obtained algorithm produces exactly same results standard dsom algorithm
