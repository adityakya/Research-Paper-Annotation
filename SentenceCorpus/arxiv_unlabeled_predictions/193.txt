MISC--: grammar inference deals determining preferable simple models grammars consistent set observations
MISC--: there large body research grammar inference within theory formal languages
MISC--: however there surprisingly little known grammar inference graph grammars
AIMX--: this paper we take further step this direction work within framework node label controlled nlc graph grammars
MISC--: specifically we characterize given set disjoint isomorphic subgraphs graph symbol whether not there nlc graph grammar rule generate subgraphs obtain symbol
MISC--: this generalizes previous results assuming set isomorphic subgraphs disjoint instead non touching
MISC--: this leads naturally consider more involved non confluent graph grammar rules
MISC--: grammar inference also called grammar induction general line research where one concerned determining simple grammar consistent given set possible impossible outcomes
MISC--: hence one goes back derivation instead determining generative power grammar one determines grammar given generated output
CONT--: this topic well studied formal languages especially respect context free languages see eg citation however relatively little known graph grammars
MISC--: topic inference graph grammars considered citation uses their so called subdue scheme developed citation
MISC--: citation rigorous approach grammar inference within framework node label controlled nlc graph grammars citation natural well studied class graph grammars initiated
MISC--: there characterized given set symbol non touching isomorphic graphs graph symbol whether not there graph grammar consisting one rule able generate graphs symbol obtain symbol
OWNX--: we continue this research generalize this result case where graphs disjoint instead non touching
OWNX--: generalization requires one deal number issues
OWNX--: most notably one deal non confluency issues generated graph depends order touching subgraphs generated addconf due space constraints proofs results omitted but found extended version
