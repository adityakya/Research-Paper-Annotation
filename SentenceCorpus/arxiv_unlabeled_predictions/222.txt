MISC--: data separable if only if they satisfy constraints if constraints satisfied sources explicitly constructed data
MISC--: method illustrated using separate two speech like sounds recorded single microphone
MISC--: sensory devices often receive signals multiple physical stimuli evolve simultaneously but unrelated one another
OWNX--: many situations necessary create separate representations one more stimuli blindly processing observed signals i e processing them without prior knowledge nature stimuli
MISC--: recent years there considerable progress solution this blind source separation bss problem special case signals source variables linearly related
CONT--: however although nonlinear bss often performed effortlessly humans computational methods doing this quite limited citation
MISC--: consider time series data symbol where symbol multiplet symbol measurements symbol
MISC--: usual objectives nonlinear bss determine if data instantaneous mixtures symbol statistically independent source components symbol symbol where symbol possibly nonlinear invertible symbol mixing function if this case compute mixing function
MISC--: other words problem find coordinate transformation symbol transforms observed data symbol measurement defined coordinate system symbol state space special source coordinate system symbol components transformed data statistically independent
MISC--: let symbol state space probability density function pdf source coordinate system defined so symbol fraction total time source trajectory symbol located within volume element symbol at location symbol
MISC--: usual formulation bss problem source components required statistically independent sense their state space pdf product density functions individual components symbol every formulation bss multiple solutions created permutations component wise transformations any one solution
MISC--: however well known criterion so weak suffers much worse non uniqueness problem namely this form bss problem multiple solutions created transformations mix source variables see citation references therein
MISC--: issue non uniqueness circumvented considering data s trajectory symbol symbol instead symbol i e state space
MISC--: first let symbol pdf this space defined so symbol fraction total time location velocity source trajectory within volume element symbol at location symbol
AIMX--: earlier paper citation described formulation bss problem this pdf was required product density functions individual components symbol separability symbol stronger requirement than separability state space
MISC--: see this note recovered integrating both sides over all velocities but latter equation cannot deduced former one
MISC--: fact shown strong enough guarantee bss problem symbol unique solution up permutations component wise transformations citation
MISC--: furthermore this type statistical independence virtue being satisfied almost all classical physical systems composed non interacting subsystems generators most signals interest
MISC--: author previously demonstrated citation symbol pdf time series induces riemannian geometry state space metric equal local second order correlation matrix data s velocity
OWNX--: nonlinear bss performed computing this metric symbol coordinate system i e computing second order correlation symbol at each point symbol well its first second derivatives respect symbol
OWNX--: however although this mathematically correct complete method solving nonlinear bss problem suffers practical difficulty namely if dimensionality state space high great deal data required cover densely enough order calculate derivatives accurately
AIMX--: current paper citation shows how perform nonlinear bss computing higher order local correlations data s velocity instead computing derivatives its second order correlation
OWNX--: this approach advantageous because requires much less data accurate computation
OWNX--: example synthetic speech separation experiment section iii new method separate two synthetic utterances recorded single microphone after minutes observation rather than hours observation required differential geometric method
