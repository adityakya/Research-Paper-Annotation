MISC--: vb optimization algorithm minimizes cost function
MISC--: cost function called negative variational free energy function latent variables
AIMX--: we called cost function energy this paper
MISC--: since vb gradient algorithm similar expectation maximization em algorithm suffers local optimal problem practice
MISC--: deterministic annealing da algorithms been proposed em algorithm citation vb citation based simulated annealing sa citation overcome issue local optima
OWNX--: we called simulated annealing based vb savb
MISC--: sa one most well known physics based approaches machine learning
MISC--: sa based concept statistical mechanics called temperature
OWNX--: we decrease parameter temperature gradually sa
OWNX--: because energy landscape becomes flat at high temperature easy change state see fig
OWNX--: however state trapped at low temperature because valley energy barrier transition probability becomes very low
MISC--: therefore sa does not necessarily find global optimum practical cooling schedule temperature symbol
OWNX--: physics quantum annealing qa attracted attention alternative annealing method optimization problems process analogous quantum fluctuations citation
MISC--: qa expected help states avoid being trapped poor local optima at low temperatures
AIMX--: main point this paper explain novel da algorithm vb based qa qavb we derived present effects qavb we obtained through experiments
MISC--: qavb generalization vb savb attained using density matrix
OWNX--: we describe our motivation deriving qavb terms density matrix section
OWNX--: here we overview qavb we derived
OWNX--: interestingly although qavb generalized formulated density matrix algorithm qavb we finally derived does not need operations density matrix eigenvalue decomposition only simple changes savb algorithm
OWNX--: since savb does not necessarily find global optimum we still need run multiple savbs independently different random initializations where symbol denote number savbs
OWNX--: here let us consider running dependently not independently multiple savbs where dependently means we run multiple savbs introducing interaction symbol among neighboring savbs randomly numbered symbol symbol symbol see fig b
MISC--: fig symbol indicates latent class states symbol data points symbol th savb
MISC--: independent savbs very low transition probability among states i e they been trapped at high temperature shown fig c while dependent qavbs changes state situation
OWNX--: this because interaction symbol starts zero i e independent gradually increases makes symbol symbol approach each other state will then moved into symbol
MISC--: if there better state around sub optimal states independent savbs find dependent savbs expected work well
OWNX--: dependent savbs just qavb where interaction symbol above scheme derived qa mechanisms will explained following section
