MISC--: approach classification problem machine learning based building local classification rules developed
OWNX--: local rules considered projections global classification rules event we want classify
OWNX--: massive global optimization algorithm used optimization quality criterion
OWNX--: algorithm polynomial complexity typical case used find all high quality local rules
OWNX--: other distinctive feature algorithm integration attributes levels selection ordered attributes rules searching original conflicting rules resolution strategy
MISC--: algorithm practical was tested number data sets uci repository comparison other predicting techniques presented
MISC--: extraction structural information raw data problem great interest both fundamental applied studies
OWNX--: this paper will focus one specific example this problem classification
MISC--: goal predict class particular event
MISC--: this problem was approached number different disciplines including statistical data analysis citation machine learning citation fuzzy logic citation operations research citation data mining citation
MISC--: result variety learning techniques was developed
MISC--: result learning represented number different forms
OWNX--: form we interested working set rules
MISC--: should stressed some other forms decision trees fuzzy models many others equivalent set rules
MISC--: set rules any other form equivalent often preferred form knowledge representation because allows simple answer question what was learned
OWNX--: this specific set rules was learned data
OWNX--: algorithm produces only answer often impossible understand what was really learned why this specific answer was produced two mentioned knowledge representations differ follows case result rule learned knowledge represented language richer than one used describe dataset case result value learned knowledge represented same language one used describe dataset citation model based techniques developed citation take training data input produce set rules statements equivalent rules classify any event
OWNX--: lazy instance based techniques developed citation return result tailored specific event we want classify
MISC--: techniques events similar given one usually found first then prediction based found instances made
MISC--: interesting attempt combine model based lazy instance based learning was presented citation
MISC--: citation greedy lazy model based approach classification was developed result was rule tailored specific observation
MISC--: while approach gives simple rule answer often much easier understand than complex rules set often works faster classification single event every greedy algorithm not guaranteed find best rule because algorithm may not reach global maximum quality criterion sub optimal rule may returned
MISC--: work citation approach based brute force rule space scanning was developed
OWNX--: was used finding nuggets knowledge data each nugget rule high degree correctness
MISC--: contrast greedy type algorithms massive search algorithms guaranteed find best rule s
AIMX--: our early work citation we presented approach combined massive model based rule search approach lazy instance based learning
OWNX--: work we were also interested nuggets knowledge but only those were applicable instance we wanted classify
OWNX--: result was set rules were applicable classification given event
MISC--: one may think about rules projection global classification rules set given instance event
AIMX--: current paper this approach taken next level practical algorithm applicable variety problems presented
MISC--: number significant improvements been made since early version
OWNX--: current algorithm includes following new features
MISC--: highly optimized rule space scanning allows problems significant number attributes solved
MISC--: integration levels selection procedure ordered continuous literal attributes rule search algorithm
MISC--: information about dependent attributes directly included into tree search algorithm thus significantly reducing computational complexity
MISC--: original conflicting rules resolution strategy was especially built work automatically generated rules
MISC--: create practical algorithm three aspects logical statistical computational complexity need addressed
OWNX--: section we formulate problem discuss logical formulas represent rules we interested finding
OWNX--: section we discuss statistical quality criterion used evaluation rule quality specify criteria we use this work
OWNX--: we also present conflicting rules resolution strategy automatically generated rules
OWNX--: at end section sketch algorithm presented
OWNX--: section we discuss selection attributes analysis should stressed some attributes they built section not independent this fact known advance
OWNX--: section we discuss computational complexity issues approach includes information about dependence attributes into algorithm proposed
OWNX--: section we discuss error estimation
OWNX--: section we present data analysis results compare our results results c r citation
OWNX--: section discussion presented
