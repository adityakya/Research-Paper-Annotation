MISC--: trailing backward compatibility
OWNX--: sty file we develop bayesian framework tackling supervised clustering problem generic problem encountered tasks reference matching coreference resolution identity uncertainty record linkage
OWNX--: our clustering model based dirichlet process prior enables us define distributions over countably infinite sets naturally arise this problem
OWNX--: we add supervision our model positing existence set unobserved random variables we call reference types generic across all clusters
OWNX--: inference our framework requires integrating over infinitely many parameters solved using markov chain monte carlo techniques
AIMX--: we present algorithms both conjugate non conjugate priors
OWNX--: we present simple but general parameterization our model based gaussian assumption
OWNX--: we evaluate this model one artificial task three real world tasks comparing against both unsupervised state art supervised algorithms
OWNX--: our results show our model able outperform other models across variety tasks performance metrics
MISC--: supervised clustering general characterization problem occurs frequently strikingly different communities
MISC--: like standard clustering problem involves breaking finite set symbol into symbol way partition symbol symbol unknown
OWNX--: distinction between supervised clustering standard clustering supervised form we given training examples
CONT--: training examples enable learning algorithm determine what aspects symbol relevant creating appropriate clustering
OWNX--: symbol training examples symbol subsets symbol paired their correct partitioning
MISC--: end supervised clustering task prediction problem new symbol presented system must produce partition
MISC--: supervised clustering problem goes under many names depending goals interested community
MISC--: relational learning community typically referred identity uncertainty primary task augment reasoning system so does not implicitly even explicitly assume there one one correspondence between elements knowledge base entities real world citation
MISC--: database community task arises context merging databases overlapping fields known record linkage citation
MISC--: information extraction particularly context extracting citations scholarly publications task identify citations same publication
MISC--: here task known reference matching citation
MISC--: natural language processing problem arises context coreference resolution wherein one wishes identify entities mentioned document same person organization real life citation
MISC--: machine learning community additionally been referred learning under equivalence constraints citation learning cluster examples citation
AIMX--: this paper we propose generative model solving supervised clustering problem
OWNX--: our model takes advantage dirichlet process prior non parametric bayesian prior over discrete distributions
OWNX--: this prior plays two crucial roles first allows us estimate number clusters symbol principled manner second allows us control complexity solutions learned
AIMX--: we present inference methods our model based markov chain monte carlo methods
OWNX--: we compare our model against other methods large real world data sets where we show able outperform most other systems according several metrics performance
AIMX--: remainder this paper structured follows
OWNX--: section we describe prior efforts tackle supervised clustering problem
OWNX--: section we develop our framework this problem starting very basic assumptions about task
OWNX--: we follow this discussion general scheme inference this framework section
