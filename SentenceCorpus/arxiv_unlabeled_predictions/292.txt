AIMX--: this paper spectrum access cognitive radio networks modeled repeated auction game subject monitoring entry costs
MISC--: secondary users sensing costs incurred result primary users activity
OWNX--: furthermore each secondary user pays cost transmissions upon successful bidding channel
MISC--: knowledge regarding other secondary users activity limited due distributed nature network
MISC--: resulting formulation thus dynamic game incomplete information
AIMX--: this paper efficient bidding learning algorithm proposed based outcome past transactions
MISC--: demonstrated through extensive simulations proposed distributed scheme outperforms myopic one stage algorithm achieve good balance between efficiency fairness
MISC--: recent studies shown despite claims spectral scarcity actual licensed spectrum remains unoccupied long periods time citation
MISC--: thus cognitive radio cr systems been proposed citation order efficiently exploit spectral holes
MISC--: crs secondary users sus wireless devices intelligently monitor adapt their environment hence they able share spectrum licensed primary users pus operating whenever pus idle
MISC--: three key design challenges active topics research cognitive radio networks namely distributed implementation spectral efficiency tradeoff between sensing spectrum access
MISC--: previous studies tackled various aspects spectrum sensing spectrum access
MISC--: citation performance spectrum sensing terms throughput investigated when sus share their instantaneous knowledge channel
MISC--: work citation studies performance different detectors spectrum sensing while citation spatial diversity methods proposed improving probability detecting pu sus
MISC--: other aspects spectrum sensing discussed citation citation
MISC--: furthermore spectrum access also received increased attention eg citation
CONT--: citation dynamic programming approach proposed allow sus maximize their channel access time while taking into account penalty factor any collision pu
MISC--: work citation references therein establish practice sensing time cr networks large affects access performance sus
MISC--: citation authors model spectrum access problem non cooperative game propose learning algorithms find correlated equilibria game
MISC--: non cooperative solutions dynamic spectrum access also proposed citation while taking into account changes sus environment arrival new pus among others
MISC--: citation when multiple sus compete spectral opportunities issues fairness efficiency arise
MISC--: one hand desirable su access channel high availability
MISC--: other hand effective achievable rate su decreases when contending many sus over most available channel
MISC--: consequently efficiency spectrum utilization system reduces
MISC--: therefore su should explore transmission opportunities other channels if available refrain transmission same channel all time
CONT--: intuitively diversifying spectrum access both frequency exploring more channels time refraining continuous transmission attempts would beneficial achieving fairness among multiple sus sus experiencing poorer channel conditions not starved long run
AIMX--: objective this paper design mechanism enables fair efficient sharing spectral resources among sus
OWNX--: we model spectrum access cognitive radio networks repeated auction game entry monitoring costs
MISC--: auctioning spectral opportunities carried out repeatedly
MISC--: at beginning each period each su wishes participate spectrum access submits bid coordinator based its view channel past auction history
MISC--: knowledge regarding other secondary users activities limited due distributed nature network
MISC--: resulting formulation thus dynamic game incomplete information
MISC--: bidder highest bid gains spectrum access
OWNX--: entry fees charged all bidders who participate auction irrespective outcome auction
OWNX--: su also choose stay out so current round case no entry fee incurred
OWNX--: at end each auction period information regarding bidding allocation made available all sus turn monitoring fee incurred
MISC--: achieve efficient bidding learning algorithm proposed based outcome past transactions
MISC--: each su decides local actions objective increasing its long term cost effectiveness
MISC--: demonstrated through extensive simulations proposed distributed scheme outperforms myopic one stage algorithm where su always participates spectrum access game both single channel multi channel networks
MISC--: comment order feasibility auction based approach spectrum access practice
MISC--: due commercial industrial exploitation different stake holders interests functional architectures cognitive signaling schemes currently under discussion within standardization forums including ieee scc etsi tc rrs reconfigurable radio systems
OWNX--: cognitive pilot channel cpc gained attention potential enabler data aided mitigation techniques between secondary primary communication systems well mechanism support optimized radio resource data management across heterogeneous networks
