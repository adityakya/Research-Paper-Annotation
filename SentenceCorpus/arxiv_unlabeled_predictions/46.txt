OWNX--: approximation optimal two part mdl code given data through successive monotonically length decreasing two part mdl codes following properties i computation each step may take arbitrarily long ii we may not know when we reach optimum whether we will reach optimum at all iii sequence models generated may not monotonically improve goodness fit but iv model associated optimum almost best goodness fit
MISC--: express practically interesting goodness fit individual models individual data sets we rely kolmogorov complexity
OWNX--: machine learning pure applications mdl rare partially because difficulties one encounters trying define adequate model code data model code partially because operational difficulties poorly understood
OWNX--: we analyze aspects both power perils mdl precisely formally
OWNX--: let us first resurrect familiar problem our childhood illustrate some issues involved
OWNX--: process solving jigsaw puzzle involves incremental reduction entropy this serves illustrate analogous features learning problems main issues this work
MISC--: initially when pieces come out box they completely random ordering
OWNX--: gradually we combine pieces thus reducing entropy increasing order until puzzle solved
OWNX--: this last stage we found maximal ordering
MISC--: suppose alice bob both start solve two versions same puzzle but they follow different strategies
OWNX--: initially alice sorts all pieces according color bob starts sorting pieces according shape sake argument we assume puzzle no recognizable edge pieces crucial insight shared experienced puzzle aficionados alice s strategy efficient whereas bob s strategy not fact even worse than random strategy
MISC--: alice s strategy efficient since probability pieces about same color match much greater than unconditional probability match
MISC--: other hand information about shape pieces only used relatively late stage puzzle process
MISC--: bob s effort beginning waste time because he must reorder pieces before he proceed solve puzzle
MISC--: this example shows if solution problem depends finding maximal reduction entropy this does not mean every reduction entropy brings us closer solution
OWNX--: consequently reduction entropy not all cases good strategy
