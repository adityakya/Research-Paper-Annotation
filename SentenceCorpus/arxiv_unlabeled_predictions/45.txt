MISC--: trailing backward compatibility
OWNX--: sty file we propose method improving approximate inference methods corrects influence loops graphical model
OWNX--: method applicable arbitrary factor graphs provided size markov blankets not too large
MISC--: alternative implementation idea introduced recently citation
OWNX--: its simplest form amounts assumption no loops present method reduces minimal cluster variation method approximation uses maximal factors outer clusters
OWNX--: other hand using estimates effect loops obtained some approximate inference algorithm applying loop correcting lc method usually gives significantly better results than applying approximate inference algorithm directly without loop corrections
OWNX--: indeed we often observe loop corrected error approximately square error approximate inference method used estimate effect loops
MISC--: we compare different variants loop correcting method other approximate inference methods variety graphical models including real world networks conclude lc approach generally obtains most accurate results
MISC--: recent years much research been done field approximate inference graphical models
MISC--: one goals obtain accurate approximations marginal probabilities complex probability distributions defined over many variables using limited computation time memory
MISC--: this research led large number approximate inference methods
BASE--: apart sampling monte carlo methods most well known methods algorithms variational approximations mean field mf originates statistical physics citation belief propagation bp also known sum product algorithm loopy belief propagation citation directly related bethe approximation used statistical physics citation cluster variation method cvm citation other region based approximation methods citation related kikuchi approximation citation generalization bethe approximation using larger clusters expectation propagation ep citation includes treeep citation special case
MISC--: calculate results cvm other region based approximation methods one use generalized belief propagation gbp algorithm citation double loop algorithms guaranteed convergence citation
MISC--: well known belief propagation yields exact results if graphical model tree more generally if each connected component tree
MISC--: if graphical model does contain loops bp still yield surprisingly accurate results using little computation time
MISC--: however if influence loops large approximate marginals calculated bp large errors quality bp results may not satisfactory
MISC--: one way correct influence short loops increase cluster size approximation using cvm gbp clusters subsume many loops possible
MISC--: however choosing good set clusters highly nontrivial citation general this method will only work if clusters do not many intersections other words if loops do not many intersections
OWNX--: another method corrects loops certain extent treeep does exact inference base tree subgraph graphical model no loops approximates other interactions
MISC--: this corrects loops consist part base tree exactly one additional factor yields good results if graphical model dominated base tree case very sparse models
MISC--: however loops consist two more interactions not part base tree approximated similar way bp
MISC--: hence denser models improvement treeep over bp usually diminishes
OWNX--: this article we propose method takes into account all loops graphical model approximate way therefore obtains more accurate results many cases
OWNX--: our method variation theme introduced citation
MISC--: basic idea first estimate cavity distributions all variables subsequently improve estimates cancelling out errors using certain consistency constraints
MISC--: cavity distribution some variable probability distribution its markov blanket all its neighbouring variables modified graphical model all factors involving variable been removed
MISC--: removal factors breaks all loops variable takes part
MISC--: this allows approximate inference algorithm estimate strength loops terms effective interactions correlations between variables markov blanket
MISC--: then influence removed factors taken into account yields accurate approximations probability distributions original graphical model
MISC--: even more accuracy obtained imposing certain consistency relations between cavity distributions results cancellation errors some extent
OWNX--: this error cancellation done message passing algorithm interpreted generalization bp pairwise case minimal cvm approximation general
MISC--: indeed assumption no loops present equivalently cavity distributions factorize yields bp minimal cvm results
MISC--: other hand using better estimates effective interactions cavity distributions yields accurate loop corrected results
BASE--: although basic idea underlying our method very similar described citation alternative implementation we propose here offers two advantages
MISC--: most importantly directly applicable arbitrary factor graphs whereas original method only been formulated rather special case graphical models binary variables pairwise factors excludes eg many interesting bayesian networks
