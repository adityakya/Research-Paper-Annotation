MISC--: frequent episode discovery popular framework pattern discovery event streams
MISC--: episode partially ordered set nodes each node associated event type
MISC--: efficient separate algorithms exist episode discovery when associated partial order total serial episode trivial parallel episode
AIMX--: this paper we propose efficient algorithms discovering frequent episodes general partial orders
MISC--: algorithms easily specialized discover serial parallel episodes
MISC--: also algorithms flexible enough specialized mining space certain interesting subclasses partial orders
MISC--: we point out there inherent combinatorial explosion frequent partial order mining most importantly frequency alone not sufficient measure interestingness
OWNX--: we propose new interestingness measure general partial order episodes discovery method based this measure filtering out uninteresting partial orders
OWNX--: simulations demonstrate effectiveness our algorithms
MISC--: frequent episode discovery citation popular framework discovering temporal patterns symbolic time series data applications several domains like manufacturing citation telecommunication citation www citation biology citation finance citation intrusion detection citation text mining citation etc
MISC--: data this framework single long time ordered stream events each temporal pattern called episode essentially small partially ordered collection nodes each node associated symbol called event type
CONT--: partial order episode constrains time order events should appear data order events constitute occurrence episode
MISC--: patterns total order their nodes called serial episodes while those empty partial order called parallel episodes citation
MISC--: task unearth all episodes whose frequency data exceeds user defined threshold
MISC--: currently separate algorithms exist literature discovering frequent serial parallel episodes data streams citation while no algorithms available case episodes general partial orders
MISC--: related work found context sequential patterns citation where data consists multiple sequences sequential pattern small partially ordered collection symbols
MISC--: sequential pattern considered frequent if there enough sequences data pattern occurs atleast once
OWNX--: contrast frequent episode discovery we looking patterns repeat often single long stream events
MISC--: this makes computational task quite different sequential patterns
AIMX--: this paper we develop algorithms discovering frequent episodes general partial order constraints over their nodes
OWNX--: we restrict our attention subclass patterns called injective episodes where event type cannot appear more than once given episode
MISC--: this facilitates design efficient algorithms no restriction whatsoever partial orders episodes
MISC--: further our algorithms handle usual expiry time constraints episode occurrences limit time spans valid occurrences some user defined maximum value
MISC--: our algorithms easily specialized either discover only frequent serial episodes only frequent parallel episodes
OWNX--: moreover we also specialize method focus discovery process certain classes partial order episodes satisfy what we call maximal subepisode property serial episodes parallel episodes specific examples classes obey this property
MISC--: we point out here one difficulties efficient discovery general partial orders there inherent combinatorial explosion number frequent episodes any given size
OWNX--: this because any partial order episode symbol nodes there exponential number subepisodes also size symbol all would occur at least often episode note this problem does not arise eg frequent serial episode discovery because symbol node serial episode cannot any symbol node serial subepisode
MISC--: thus frequency alone insufficient measure interestingness episodes general partial orders
OWNX--: tackle this we propose new measure called bidirectional evidence captures some notion entropy relative frequencies pairs events occurring either order observed occurrences episode
MISC--: mining procedure now requires user defined threshold bidirectional evidence addition usual frequency threshold
OWNX--: we demonstrate utility our algorithms through extensive empirical studies

MISC--: candidate generation described sec
OWNX--: sec describes our new interestingness measure
OWNX--: we present simulation results sec conclude sec
