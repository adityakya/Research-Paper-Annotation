AIMX--: this paper introduces new approach solve sensor management problems
OWNX--: classically sensor management problems well formalized partially observed markov decision processes pompd
MISC--: original approach developped here consists deriving optimal parameterized policy based stochastic gradient estimation
AIMX--: we assume this work possible learn optimal policy off line simulation using models environement sensor s
OWNX--: learned policy then used manage sensor s
OWNX--: order approximate gradient stochastic context we introduce new method approximate gradient based infinitesimal approximation ipa
MISC--: effectiveness this general framework illustrated managing electronically scanned array radar
MISC--: years after years complexity performances many sensors increased leading more more complex sensor s based systems supply decision centers increasing amount data
MISC--: number types agility sensors along increased quality data far outstrip ability human manage them often difficult compare how much information gained way given management scheme citation
MISC--: results this necessity derive unmanned sensing platforms capacity adapt their environment citation
MISC--: this problem often refered sensor s management problem
MISC--: more simple situations operational context may lead works sensor s management like radar infrared sensor case citation
MISC--: general definition this problem could then sensor management effective use available sensing database capabilities meet mission goals
MISC--: many applications deal military applications classical one being detect track tp identify smart targets smart target change its way moving its way sensing when detects under analysis several sensors
OWNX--: questions then following at each time how must we group sensors how long direction functioning mode
MISC--: increasing complexity targets detected tracked identified makes management even more difficult led development researches definition optimal sensor management scheme targets sensors treated altogether complex dynamic system citation
MISC--: sensor management become very popular this last years many approaches found litterature
MISC--: citation citation authors use modelling detection process electronically scanned array esa radar propose management scheme during detection step
MISC--: citation information based approach use manage set sensors
MISC--: theorical point view sensor management modelled partially observable markov decision process pomdp citation
MISC--: whatever underlying application sensor management problem consists choosing at each time symbol action symbol within set symbol available actions
MISC--: choice symbol generally based density state vector symbol describing environment system variables system itself
OWNX--: generally assumed state at least part this state markovian
MISC--: moreover most applications we only access partial information state symbol must estimated measurements symbol
OWNX--: this estimation process often derived within bayesian framework where we use state dynamics observation models symbol symbol where symbol symbol symbol symbol respectively stands state noise measurements noise state dynamics measurement function
MISC--: symbol symbol generally time varying functions
MISC--: control problem consists finding scheduling policy symbol i e select symbol given past possible futures
MISC--: however this control problem may theorical solution generally untractable practice
MISC--: however few works propose optimal solution frame pomdps like citation
MISC--: beside several works been carried out find sub optimal policies like instance myopic policies
MISC--: reinforcement learning q learning also been used propose solution citation
AIMX--: we propose this paper look policy within class parametrized policy symbol learn means learn optimal value symbol
AIMX--: funding our work approach described citation we assume possible learn this policy simulation using models overall system
OWNX--: once optimal parameter been found used manage sensor s
AIMX--: frame this work being detection localization targets we show last part this paper how may applied management esa radar
OWNX--: section described modelling sensor management problem using pomdp approach
OWNX--: section we derive algorithm learn parameter policy
OWNX--: section we show how this method may used tasking esa radar
OWNX--: finally section exhibits firts simulations results
