MISC--: counting fundamental operation
MISC--: example counting symbol th frequency moment symbol streaming signal symbol where symbol denotes time been active area research theoretical computer science databases data mining
MISC--: when symbol task i e counting sum accomplished using counter
MISC--: when symbol however becomes non trivial design small space i e low memory counting system
MISC--: compressed counting cc proposed efficiently computing symbol th frequency moment data stream symbol where symbol
OWNX--: cc applicable if streaming data follow turnstile model restriction at time symbol evaluation symbol includes strict turnstile model special case
MISC--: data streams practice this restriction minor
MISC--: underlying technique skewed stable random projections captures intuition when symbol simple counter suffices when symbol small symbol sample complexity should low continuously function symbol
OWNX--: we show sample complexity number projections symbol where symbol symbol
OWNX--: other words small symbol symbol instead symbol
MISC--: case symbol practically very important
MISC--: now well understood one obtain good approximations entropies data streams using symbol th moments symbol very small symbol
MISC--: statistical inference using method moments sometimes reasonable use symbol th moments symbol very close
MISC--: another example symbol might decay rate interest rate usually small
MISC--: thus compressed counting will ideal tool estimating total value future taking account effect decaying interest accruement
OWNX--: finally our another contribution algorithm approximating logarithmic norm symbol logarithmic distance symbol
MISC--: logarithmic norm arises statistical estimations
MISC--: logarithmic distance useful machine learning practice heavy tailed data
AIMX--: this paper focuses counting among most fundamental operations almost every field science engineering
MISC--: computing sum symbol simplest counting symbol denotes time
MISC--: counting symbol th moment symbol more general
MISC--: when symbol symbol counts total number non zeros symbol
MISC--: when symbol symbol counts energy power signal symbol
MISC--: if symbol actually outputs power underlying signal symbol counting sum symbol equivalent computing symbol
MISC--: here symbol denotes time varying signal example data streams citation
MISC--: literature symbol th frequency moment data stream symbol defined counting symbol massive data streams practically important among many challenging issues data stream computations
OWNX--: fact general theme scaling up high dimensional data high speed data streams among ten challenging problems data mining research
MISC--: because elements symbol time varying na ive counting mechanism requires system symbol counters compute symbol exactly
OWNX--: this not always realistic when symbol large we only need approximate answer
MISC--: example symbol may symbol if symbol records arrivals ip addresses
MISC--: symbol total number checking savings accounts
MISC--: compressed counting cc new scheme approximating symbol th frequency moments data streams where symbol using low memory
OWNX--: underlying technique based what we call skewed stable random projections
