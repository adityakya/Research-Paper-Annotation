MISC--: reinforcement learning means learning policy mapping observations into actions based feedback environment
OWNX--: learning viewed browsing set policies while evaluating them trial through interaction environment
AIMX--: we present application gradient ascent algorithm reinforcement learning complex domain packet routing network communication compare performance this algorithm other routing methods benchmark problem
MISC--: successful telecommunication requires efficient resource allocation achieved developing adaptive control policies
OWNX--: reinforcement learning rl citation presents natural framework development policies trial error process interaction environment
BASE--: this work we apply rl algorithm network routing
MISC--: effective network routing means selecting optimal communication paths
MISC--: modeled multi agent rl problem
MISC--: sense learning optimal control network routing could thought learning some traditional rl episodic task like maze searching pole balancing but repeating trials many times parallel interaction among trials
MISC--: under this interpretation individual router agent makes its routing decisions according individual policy
MISC--: parameters this policy adjusted according some measure global performance network while control determined local observations
MISC--: nodes do not any information regarding topology network their position
MISC--: initialization each node well learning algorithm follows identical every other node independent structure network
MISC--: there no notion orientation space other semantics actions
OWNX--: our approach allows us update local policies while avoiding necessity centralized control global knowledge networks structure
MISC--: only global information required learning algorithm network utility expressed reward signal distributed once epoch dependent average routing time
MISC--: this learning multi agent system biologically plausible could thought neural network each neuron only performs simple computations based locally available quantities citation
