MISC--: given finite set words symbol independently drawn according fixed unknown distribution law symbol called stochastic language usual goal grammatical inference infer estimate symbol some class probabilistic models probabilistic automata pa
AIMX--: here we study class symbol rational stochastic languages consists stochastic languages generated multiplicity automata ma strictly includes class stochastic languages generated pa
MISC--: rational stochastic languages minimal normal representation may very concise whose parameters efficiently estimated stochastic samples
OWNX--: we design efficient inference algorithm dees aims at building minimal normal representation target
OWNX--: despite fact no recursively enumerable class ma computes exactly symbol we show dees strongly identifies symbol limit
OWNX--: we study intermediary ma output dees show they compute rational series converge absolutely one used provide stochastic languages closely estimate target
MISC--: probabilistic grammatical inference supposed data arise form finite set words symbol built predefinite alphabet symbol independently drawn according fixed unknown distribution law symbol called stochastic language
MISC--: then usual goal try infer estimate this distribution law some class probabilistic models probabilistic automata pa same expressivity hidden markov models hmm
MISC--: pa identifiable limit citation
MISC--: however our knowledge there exists no efficient inference algorithm able deal whole class stochastic languages generated pa
MISC--: most previous works use restricted subclasses pa probabilistic deterministic automata pda citation
AIMX--: other hand probabilistic automata particular cases multiplicity automata stochastic languages generated multiplicity automata special cases rational languages we call rational stochastic languages
CONT--: ma been used grammatical inference variant exact learning model angluin citation but not probabilistic grammatical inference
MISC--: let us design symbol class rational stochastic languages over semiring symbol
MISC--: when symbol symbol symbol exactly class stochastic languages generated pa parameters symbol
MISC--: but when symbol symbol we obtain strictly greater classes provide several advantages at least one drawback elements symbol may significantly smaller representation symbol clearly advantage learning perspective elements symbol minimal normal representation while normal representations do not exist pa parameters minimal representations directly related probabilities some natural events form symbol efficiently estimated stochastic samples lastly when symbol field rational series over symbol form vector space efficient linear algebra techniques used deal rational stochastic languages
MISC--: however class symbol presents serious drawback there exists no recursively enumerable subset ma exactly generates citation
MISC--: moreover this class representations unstable arbitrarily close ma generates stochastic language we may find ma whose associated rational series symbol takes negative values not absolutely convergent global weight symbol may unbounded not absolutely defined
OWNX--: however we show symbol strongly identifiable limit we design algorithm dees any target symbol given access infinite sample symbol drawn according symbol will converge finite but unbounded number steps minimal normal representation symbol
MISC--: moreover dees efficient runs within polynomial time size input computes minimal number parameters classical statistical rates convergence
CONT--: however before converging target dees output ma close target but do not compute stochastic languages
OWNX--: question what kind guarantees do we intermediary hypotheses how we use them probabilistic inference purpose
OWNX--: we show since algorithm aims at building minimal normal representation target intermediary hypotheses symbol output dees nice property they absolutely converge i e symbol symbol
MISC--: consequence symbol defined without ambiguity any symbol shown symbol tends learning proceeds
OWNX--: given any series symbol we efficiently compute stochastic language symbol not rational but property symbol any word symbol symbol
MISC--: our conclusion despite fact no recursively enumerable class ma represents class rational stochastic languages ma used efficiently infer stochastic languages
OWNX--: classical notions stochastic languages rational series multiplicity automata recalled section
AIMX--: we study example shows representation rational stochastic languages ma real parameters may very concise
OWNX--: we introduce our inference algorithm dees section we show symbol strongly indentifiable limit
OWNX--: we study properties ma output dees section we show they define absolutely convergent rational series used compute stochastic languages estimates target
