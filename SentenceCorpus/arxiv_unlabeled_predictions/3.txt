AIMX--: this paper addresses problem distributed learning under communication constraints motivated distributed signal processing wireless sensor networks data mining distributed databases
MISC--: after formalizing general model distributed learning algorithm collaboratively training regularized kernel least squares regression estimators derived
MISC--: noting algorithm viewed application successive orthogonal projection algorithms its convergence properties investigated statistical behavior estimator discussed simplified theoretical setting
AIMX--: this paper we address problem distributed learning under communication constraints motivated primarily distributed signal processing wireless sensor networks wsns data mining distributed databases
MISC--: wsns fortiori designed make inferences environments they sensing however they typically characterized constraints energy bandwidth limit sensors ability share data each other centralized fusion center
CONT--: data mining distributed databases multiple agents e g corporations access possibly overlapping databases wish collaborate make optimal inferences privacy security concerns however may preclude them fully sharing information
MISC--: nonparametric methods studied within machine learning demonstrated widespread empirical success many centralized i e communication unconstrained signal processing applications
MISC--: thus both aforementioned applications natural question arises power machine learning methods tapped nonparametric inference distributed learning under communication constraints
AIMX--: this paper we address this question formalizing general model distributed learning then deriving distributed algorithm collaborative training regularized kernel least squares regression
MISC--: algorithm viewed instantiation successive orthogonal projection algorithms thus insight into statistical behavior algorithms gleaned standard analyses mathematical programming
