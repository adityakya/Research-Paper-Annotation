AIMX--: this paper proposes method construct adaptive agent universal respect given class experts where each expert agent been designed specifically particular environment
MISC--: this adaptive control problem formalized problem minimizing relative entropy adaptive agent expert most suitable unknown environment
MISC--: if agent passive observer then optimal solution well known bayesian predictor
MISC--: however if agent active then its past actions need treated causal interventions i o stream rather than normal probability conditions
MISC--: here shown solution this new variational problem given stochastic controller called bayesian control rule implements adaptive behavior mixture experts
MISC--: furthermore shown under mild assumptions bayesian control rule converges control law most suitable expert
MISC--: when behavior environment under any control signal fully known then designer choose agent produces desired dynamics
CONT--: instances this problem include hitting target cannon under known weather conditions solving maze having its map controlling robotic arm manufacturing plant
MISC--: however when behavior plant unknown then designer faces problem adaptive control
OWNX--: example shooting cannon lacking appropriate measurement equipment finding way out unknown maze designing autonomous robot martian exploration
MISC--: adaptive control turns out far more difficult than its non adaptive counterpart
OWNX--: this because any good policy carefully trade off explorative versus exploitative actions i e actions identification environment s dynamics versus actions control desired way
MISC--: even when environment s dynamics known belong particular class optimal agents available constructing corresponding optimal adaptive agent general computationally intractable even simple toy problems citation
MISC--: thus finding tractable approximations been major focus research
MISC--: recently been proposed reformulate problem statement some classes control problems based minimization relative entropy criterion
MISC--: example large class optimal control problems solved very efficiently if problem statement reformulated minimization deviation dynamics controlled system uncontrolled system citation
MISC--: this work similar approach introduced
MISC--: if class agents given where each agent solves different environment then adaptive controllers derived minimum relative entropy principle
MISC--: particular one construct adaptive agent universal respect this class minimizing average relative entropy environment specific agent
CONT--: however this extension not straightforward
MISC--: there syntactical difference between actions observations taken into account when formulating variational problem
MISC--: more specifically actions treated interventions obeying rules causality citation
MISC--: if this distinction made variational problem unique solution given stochastic control rule called bayesian control rule
MISC--: this control rule particularly interesting because translates adaptive control problem into line inference problem applied forward time
OWNX--: furthermore this work shows under mild assumptions adaptive agent converges environment specific agent
