MISC--: conventional supervised pattern recognition tasks model selection typically accomplished minimizing classification error rate set so called development data subject ground truth labeling human experts some other means
MISC--: context speech processing systems other large scale practical applications however labeled development data typically costly difficult obtain
AIMX--: this article proposes alternative semi supervised framework likelihood based model selection leverages unlabeled data using trained classifiers representing each model automatically generate putative labels
OWNX--: errors result this automatic labeling shown amenable results robust statistics turn provide minimax optimal censored likelihood ratio tests recover nonparametric sign test limiting case
CONT--: this approach then validated experimentally using state art automatic speech recognition system select between candidate word pronunciations using unlabeled speech data only potentially contain instances words under test
CONT--: results provide supporting evidence utility this approach suggest may also find use other applications machine learning
OWNX--: ieeeparstart t his article develops simple powerful likelihood ratio framework enables use unlabeled development data model selection system optimization context large scale speech processing
MISC--: within speech engineering community acoustic likelihoods long played prominent role both training criterion objective function aid system development
MISC--: log likelihood ratios turn featured ever more prominently areas speech speaker language recognition instance now common practice target model likelihoods compared those universal background model part many large scale speech processing systems citation
