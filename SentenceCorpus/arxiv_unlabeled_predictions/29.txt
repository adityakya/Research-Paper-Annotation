MISC--: there at least two kinds similarity
MISC--: relational similarity correspondence between relations contrast attributional similarity correspondence between attributes
OWNX--: when two words high degree attributional similarity we call them synonyms
OWNX--: when two pairs words high degree relational similarity we say their relations analogous
MISC--: example word pair mason stone analogous pair carpenter wood
AIMX--: this paper introduces latent relational analysis lra method measuring relational similarity
MISC--: lra potential applications many areas including information extraction word sense disambiguation information retrieval
MISC--: recently vector space model vsm information retrieval been adapted measuring relational similarity achieving score collection college level multiple choice word analogy questions
MISC--: vsm approach relation between pair words characterized vector frequencies predefined patterns large corpus
OWNX--: lra extends vsm approach three ways patterns derived automatically corpus singular value decomposition svd used smooth frequency data automatically generated synonyms used explore variations word pairs
MISC--: lra achieves analogy questions statistically equivalent average human score
MISC--: related problem classifying semantic relations lra achieves similar gains over vsm
MISC--: there at least two kinds similarity
MISC--: attributional similarity correspondence between attributes relational similarity correspondence between relations citation
OWNX--: when two words high degree attributional similarity we call them synonyms
OWNX--: when two word pairs high degree relational similarity we say they analogous
MISC--: verbal analogies often written form b c d meaning b c d example traffic street water riverbed
MISC--: traffic flows over street water flows over riverbed
MISC--: street carries traffic riverbed carries water
MISC--: there high degree relational similarity between word pair traffic street word pair water riverbed
MISC--: fact this analogy basis several mathematical theories traffic flow citation
OWNX--: section we look more closely at connections between attributional relational similarity
MISC--: analogies mason stone carpenter wood seems relational similarity reduced attributional similarity since mason carpenter attributionally similar stone wood
MISC--: general this reduction fails
MISC--: consider analogy traffic street water riverbed
MISC--: traffic water not attributionally similar
MISC--: street riverbed only moderately attributionally similar
MISC--: many algorithms been proposed measuring attributional similarity between two words citation
MISC--: measures attributional similarity been studied extensively due their applications problems recognizing synonyms citation information retrieval citation determining semantic orientation citation grading student essays citation measuring textual cohesion citation word sense disambiguation citation
MISC--: other hand since measures relational similarity not well developed measures attributional similarity potential applications relational similarity not well known
MISC--: many problems involve semantic relations would benefit algorithm measuring relational similarity
OWNX--: we discuss related problems natural language processing information retrieval information extraction more detail section
AIMX--: this paper builds vector space model vsm information retrieval
MISC--: given query search engine produces ranked list documents
MISC--: documents ranked order decreasing attributional similarity between query each document
MISC--: almost all modern search engines measure attributional similarity using vsm citation namecite turneylittman adapt vsm approach measuring relational similarity
MISC--: they used vector frequencies patterns corpus represent relation between pair words
OWNX--: section presents vsm approach measuring similarity
OWNX--: section we present algorithm measuring relational similarity we call latent relational analysis lra
MISC--: algorithm learns large corpus unlabeled unstructured text without supervision
MISC--: lra extends vsm approach namecite turneylittman three ways connecting patterns derived automatically corpus instead using fixed set patterns singular value decomposition svd used smooth frequency data given word pair traffic street lra considers transformations word pair generated replacing one words synonyms traffic road traffic highway
OWNX--: section presents our experimental evaluation lra collection multiple choice word analogy questions sat college entrance exam
MISC--: example typical sat question appears table
MISC--: educational testing literature first pair mason stone called stem analogy
MISC--: correct choice called solution incorrect choices distractors
OWNX--: we evaluate lra testing its ability select solution avoid distractors
MISC--: average performance college bound senior high school students verbal sat questions corresponds accuracy about
MISC--: lra achieves accuracy about
MISC--: same questions vsm attained one application relational similarity classifying semantic relations noun modifier pairs citation
OWNX--: section we evaluate performance lra set noun modifier pairs namecite nastase
MISC--: problem classify noun modifier pair laser printer according semantic relation between head noun printer modifier laser
MISC--: pairs been manually labeled classes semantic relations
MISC--: example laser printer classified instrument printer uses laser instrument printing
OWNX--: we approach task classifying semantic relations noun modifier pairs supervised learning problem
MISC--: pairs divided into training testing sets testing pair classified according label its single nearest neighbour training set
OWNX--: lra used measure distance i e similarity nearness
MISC--: lra achieves accuracy class problem class problem
MISC--: same noun modifier pairs vsm had accuracies class class citation
OWNX--: we discuss experimental results limitations lra future work section we conclude section
