MISC--: competitive line prediction also known universal prediction individual sequences strand learning theory avoiding making any stochastic assumptions about way observations generated
MISC--: predictor s goal compete benchmark class prediction rules often proper banach function space iffullalso popular various discrete classes finite state automata blueendmetric entropy provides unifying framework competitive line prediction numerous known upper bounds metric entropy various compact sets function spaces readily imply bounds performance line prediction strategies
AIMX--: this paper discusses strengths limitations direct approach competitive line prediction via metric entropy including comparisons other approaches
MISC--: typical result competitive line prediction says given benchmark class prediction strategies there prediction strategy performs almost well best prediction strategies benchmark class
OWNX--: simplicity this paper performance prediction strategy will measured cumulative squared distance between its predictions true observations assumed real occasionally complex numbers
MISC--: different methods competitive line predictions gradient descent following perturbed leader strong weak aggregating algorithms defensive forecasting etc tend their narrow area expertise each works well benchmark classes specific size but not readily applicable classes different size
OWNX--: this paper we will apply simple general method based metric entropy benchmark classes wide range sizes
MISC--: typically this method does not give optimal results but its results often not much worse than those given specialized methods especially benchmark classes not too massive
OWNX--: since method almost universally applicable sheds new light known results
MISC--: another disadvantage metric entropy method not clear how implement efficiently whereas many other methods computationally very efficient
OWNX--: therefore results obtained this method only first step we should looking other prediction strategies both computationally more efficient having better performance guarantees
OWNX--: we start s stating simple asymptotic result about existence universal prediction strategy class continuous prediction rules
MISC--: performance universal strategy long run good performance any continuous prediction rule but we do not attempt estimate rate at former approaches latter
OWNX--: this topic following section s where we establish general results about performance guarantees based metric entropy
MISC--: example simplest case where benchmark class symbol compact set performance guarantees become weaker metric entropy symbol becomes larger
MISC--: core paper organized according types metric compacts pointed out kolmogorov tikhomirov citation s
OWNX--: type i compacts metric entropy order symbol this case corresponds finite dimensional benchmark classes treated s
OWNX--: type ii typical order symbol contains various classes analytic functions dealt s
OWNX--: key deals perhaps most important case order symbol this includes eg besov classes
MISC--: classes type iv considered s metric entropy grows even faster
MISC--: s s benchmark class always given
OWNX--: we ask question how prediction strategies competitive against various benchmark classes compare each other
OWNX--: previous section s prepares ground this iffullin standard methods used deduce implications results preceding sections statistical learning theory blueendthe concluding section s lists several directions further research
OWNX--: there no real novelty this paper i just apply known results about metric entropy competitive line prediction
MISC--: i hope will useful survey
