OWNX--: while general trading off exploration exploitation reinforcement learning hard under some formulations relatively simple solutions exist
OWNX--: optimal decision thresholds multi armed bandit problem one infinite horizon discounted reward case one finite horizon undiscounted reward case derived make link between reward horizon uncertainty need exploration explicit
MISC--: this result follow two practical approximate algorithms illustrated experimentally
MISC--: reinforcement learning dilemma between selecting actions maximise expected return according current world model improve world model potentially able achieve higher expected return referred exploration exploitation trade off
MISC--: this been subject much interest before one earliest developments being theory sequential sampling statistics developed citation
MISC--: this dealt mostly making sequential decisions accepting one among set particular hypothesis view towards applying jointly decide termination experiment acceptance hypothesis
MISC--: more general overview sequential decision problems bayesian viewpoint offered citation
MISC--: optimal but intractable bayesian solution bandit problems was given citation while recently tight bounds sample complexity exploration been found citation
MISC--: approximation full bayesian case general reinforcement learning problem given citation while alternative technique based eliminating actions confidently estimated low value given citation
OWNX--: following section formulates intuitive concept trading exploration exploitation natural consequence definition problem reinforcement learning
OWNX--: after problem definitions correspond either extreme identified sec
MISC--: derives threshold switching exploratory greedy behaviour bandit problems
OWNX--: this threshold found depend effective reward horizon optimal policy our current belief distribution expected rewards each action
MISC--: sketch extension mdps presented sec
OWNX--: section uses upper bound value exploration derive practical algorithms then illustrated experimentally sec
MISC--: 
OWNX--: we conclude discussion relations other methods
