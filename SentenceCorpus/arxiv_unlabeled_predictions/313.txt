OWNX--: despite conventional wisdom proactive security superior reactive security we show reactive security competitive proactive security long reactive defender learns past attacks instead myopically overreacting last attack
AIMX--: our game theoretic model follows common practice security literature making worst case assumptions about attacker we grant attacker complete knowledge defender s strategy do not require attacker act rationally
OWNX--: this model we bound competitive ratio between reactive defense algorithm inspired online learning theory best fixed proactive defense
OWNX--: additionally we show unlike proactive defenses this reactive strategy robust lack information about attacker s incentives knowledge
MISC--: many enterprises employ chief information security officer ciso manage enterprise s information security risks
MISC--: typically enterprise many more security vulnerabilities than realistically repair
CONT--: instead declaring enterprise insecure until every last vulnerability plugged cisos typically perform cost benefit analysis identify risks address but what constitutes effective ciso strategy
MISC--: conventional wisdom citation cisos ought adopt forward looking proactive approach mitigating security risk examining enterprise vulnerabilities might exploited future
MISC--: advocates proactive security often equate reactive security myopic bug chasing consider ineffective
OWNX--: we establish sufficient conditions when reacting strategically attacks effective discouraging attackers
OWNX--: we study efficacy reactive strategies economic model ciso s security cost benefit trade offs
OWNX--: unlike previously proposed economic models security see section we do not assume attacker acts according fixed probability distribution
OWNX--: instead we consider game theoretic model strategic attacker who responds defender s strategy
OWNX--: standard security literature we make worst case assumptions about attacker
OWNX--: example we grant attacker complete knowledge defender s strategy do not require attacker act rationally
OWNX--: further we make conservative assumptions about reactive defender s knowledge do not assume defender knows all vulnerabilities system attacker s incentives
MISC--: however we do assume defender observe attacker s past actions example via intrusion detection system user metrics citation
OWNX--: our model we find two properties sufficient reactive strategy perform well best proactive strategies
OWNX--: first no single attack catastrophic meaning defender survive number attacks
MISC--: this consistent situations where intrusions say steal credit card numbers regrettable but not business ending
MISC--: second defender s budget term liquid meaning defender re allocate resources without penalty
MISC--: example ciso reassign members security team managing firewall rules improving database access controls at relatively low switching costs
OWNX--: because our model abstracts many vulnerabilities into single graph edge we view act defense increasing attacker s term cost mounting attack instead preventing attack e g patching single bug
OWNX--: making this assumption we choose not study tactical patch patch interaction attacker defender
OWNX--: instead we model enterprise security at more abstract level appropriate ciso
MISC--: example ciso might allocate portion his her budget engage consultancy whitehat isec partners find fix cross site scripting particular web application require employees use securid tokens during authentication
OWNX--: we make technical assumption attacker costs linearly dependent defense investments locally
OWNX--: this assumption does not reflect patch patch interaction would better represented step function step placed at cost deploy patch
OWNX--: instead this assumption reflects ciso s higher level viewpoint where staircase summed step functions fades into slope
OWNX--: we evaluate defender s strategy measuring attacker s cumulative return investment term return attack roa been proposed previously citation
OWNX--: studying this metric we focus defenders who seek cut off attacker s oxygen reduce attacker s incentives attacking enterprise
OWNX--: we do not distinguish between successful unsuccessful attacks
OWNX--: instead we compare payoff attacker receives his her nefarious deeds cost performing said deeds
OWNX--: we imagine sufficiently disincentivized attackers will seek alternatives attacking different organization starting legitimate business
OWNX--: our main result we show sufficient conditions learning based reactive strategy competitive best fixed proactive defense sense competitive ratio between reactive roa proactive roa at most symbol all symbol provided game lasts sufficiently many rounds at least symbol
OWNX--: prove our theorems we draw techniques online learning literature
OWNX--: we extend techniques case where learner does not know all game matrix rows priori letting us analyze situations where defender does not know all vulnerabilities advance
OWNX--: although our main results graph based model single attacker our results generalize model based horn clauses multiple attackers
OWNX--: our results also robust switching roa attacker profit allowing proactive defender revise defense allocation fixed number times
OWNX--: although myopic bug chasing most likely ineffective reactive strategy we find some situations strategic reactive strategy effective optimal fixed proactive defense
OWNX--: fact we find natural strategy gradually reinforcing attacked edges shifting budget unattacked edges learns attacker s incentives constructs effective defense
OWNX--: strategic reactive strategy both easier implement than proactive strategy because does not presume defender knows attacker s intent capabilities less wasteful than proactive strategy because defender does not expend budget attacks do not actually occur
OWNX--: based our results we encourage cisos question assumption proactive risk management inherently superior reactive risk management paragraph organization section formalizes our model
OWNX--: section shows perimeter defense defense depth arise naturally our model
OWNX--: section presents our main results bounding competitive ratio reactive versus proactive defense strategies
OWNX--: section outlines scenarios reactive security out performs proactive security
OWNX--: section generalizes our results horn clauses multiple attackers
OWNX--: section relates related work
OWNX--: section concludes
