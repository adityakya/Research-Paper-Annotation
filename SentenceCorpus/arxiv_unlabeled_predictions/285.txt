AIMX--: we investigate problem learning topic model well known latent dirichlet allocation distributed manner using cluster c processors dividing corpus learned equally among them
OWNX--: we propose simple approximated method tuned trading speed accuracy according task at hand
OWNX--: our approach asynchronous therefore suitable clusters heterogenous machines
MISC--: very large datasets becoming increasingly common specific collections reuters pubmed very broad large ones images metadata sites like flickr scanned books sites like google books whole internet content itself
MISC--: topic models latent dirichlet allocation lda proved useful tool model collections but suffer scalability limitations
CONT--: even though there been some recent advances speeding up inference models this still remains fundamental open problem
