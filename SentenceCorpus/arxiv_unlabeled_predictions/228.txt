CONT--: experimental verification been method choice verifying stability multi agent reinforcement learning marl algorithm number agents grows theoretical analysis becomes prohibitively complex
MISC--: cooperative agents where ultimate goal optimize some global metric stability usually verified observing evolution global performance metric over time

CONT--: main contribution this note establishing need better experimental frameworks measures assess stability large scale adaptive cooperative systems
AIMX--: we show experimental case study where stability global performance metric rather deceiving hiding underlying instability system later leads significant drop performance
OWNX--: we then propose alternative metric relies agents local policies show experimentally our proposed metric more effective than traditional global performance metric exposing instability marl algorithms
MISC--: term convergence reinforcement learning context refers stability learning process underlying model over time
MISC--: similar single agent reinforcement learning algorithms q learning citation convergence multi agent reinforcement learning marl algorithm important property received considerable attention citation
MISC--: however proving convergence marl algorithm via theoretical analysis significantly more challenging than proving convergence single agent case
MISC--: presence other agents also learning deem environment non stationary therefore violating foundational assumption single agent learning
MISC--: fact proving convergence marl algorithm even player action single stage games arguably simplest class multi agent systems domains been challenging citation
MISC--: consequence experimental verification usually method choice number agents grows theoretical analysis becomes prohibitively complex
MISC--: cooperative agents researchers typically verified stability marl algorithm observing evolution some global performance metric overtime citation
MISC--: this not surprising since ultimate goal cooperative system optimize some global metric
MISC--: examples global performance metrics include percentage total number delivered packets routing problems citation average turn around time tasks task allocation problems citation average reward received agents general citation
MISC--: if global metric improves over time eventually appears stabilize usually considered reasonable verification convergence citation
MISC--: even if underlying agent policies not stable one could argue at end global performance all matters cooperative system
AIMX--: this paper challenges above widely used practice establishes need better experimental frameworks measures assessing stability large scale cooperative systems
AIMX--: we show experimental case study where stability global performance metric hide underlying instability system
MISC--: this hidden instability later leads significant drop global performance metric itself
OWNX--: we propose alternative measure relies agents local policies policy entropy
OWNX--: we experimentally show proposed metric more effective than traditional global performance metric exposing instability marl algorithms large scale multi agent systems
AIMX--: paper organized follows
AIMX--: section describes case study we will using throughout paper
OWNX--: section reviews marl algorithms particular focus wpl giga wolf two algorithms we use our experimental evaluation
OWNX--: section presents our initial experimental results where global performance metric leads misleading conclusion marl algorithm converges
OWNX--: section presents our proposed measure illustrates how used expose hidden instability marl algorithm
OWNX--: we conclude section
