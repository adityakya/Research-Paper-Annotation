MISC--: recognizing analogies synonyms anto nyms associations appear four distinct tasks requiring distinct nlp algorithms
MISC--: past four tasks been treated independently using wide variety algorithms
OWNX--: four semantic classes however tiny sample full range semantic phenomena we cannot afford create ad hoc algorithms each semantic phenomenon we need seek unified approach
OWNX--: we propose subsume broad range phenomena under analogies
AIMX--: limit scope this paper we restrict our attention subsumption synonyms antonyms associations
AIMX--: we introduce supervised corpus based machine learning algorithm classifying analogous word pairs we show solve multiple choice sat analogy questions toefl synonym questions esl synonym antonym questions similar associated both questions cognitive psychology
MISC--: pair words petrify stone analogous another pair vaporize gas when semantic relations between words first pair highly similar relations second pair
MISC--: two words levied imposed synonymous context levied tax when they interchanged imposed tax they antonymous when they opposite meanings black white they associated when they tend co occur doctor hospital
OWNX--: surface appears four distinct semantic classes requiring distinct nlp algorithms but we propose uniform approach all four
OWNX--: we subsume synonyms antonyms associations under analogies
MISC--: essence we say symbol symbol antonyms when pair symbol symbol analogous pair black white symbol symbol synonyms when they analogous pair levied imposed symbol symbol associated when they analogous pair doctor hospital
MISC--: there past work recognizing analogies citation synonyms citation antonyms citation associations citation but each four tasks been examined separately isolation others
OWNX--: far we know algorithm proposed here first attempt deal all four tasks using uniform approach
BASE--: we believe important seek nlp algorithms handle broad range semantic phenomena because developing specialized algorithm each phenomenon very inefficient research strategy
OWNX--: might seem lexicon wordnet citation contains all information we need handle four tasks
OWNX--: however we prefer take corpus based approach semantics
OWNX--: veale shortcite veale used wordnet answer multiple choice sat analogy questions achieving accuracy but best corpus based approach attains accuracy citation
MISC--: another reason prefer corpus based approach lexicon based approach former requires less human labour thus easier extend other languages
OWNX--: section we describe our algorithm recognizing analogies
OWNX--: we use standard supervised machine learning approach feature vectors based frequencies patterns large corpus
OWNX--: we use support vector machine svm learn how classify feature vectors citation
OWNX--: section presents four sets experiments
BASE--: we apply our algorithm recognizing analogies multiple choice analogy questions sat college entrance test multiple choice synonym questions toefl test english foreign language esl english second language practice questions distinguishing synonyms antonyms set word pairs labeled similar associated both developed experiments cognitive psychology
OWNX--: we discuss results experiments section
CONT--: accuracy algorithm competitive other systems but strength algorithm able handle all four tasks no tuning learning parameters particular task
MISC--: performs well although competing against specialized algorithms developed single tasks
BASE--: related work examined section limitations future work considered section
OWNX--: we conclude section
