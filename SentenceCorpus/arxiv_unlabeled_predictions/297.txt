OWNX--: we consider problem reconstructing low rank matrix small subset its entries
OWNX--: this paper we describe implementation efficient algorithm proposed citation based singular value decomposition followed local manifold optimization solving low rank matrix completion problem
MISC--: been shown if number revealed entries large enough output singular value decomposition gives good estimate original matrix so local optimization reconstructs correct matrix high probability
OWNX--: we present numerical results show this algorithm reconstruct low rank matrix exactly very small subset its entries
OWNX--: we further study robustness algorithm respect noise its performance actual collaborative filtering datasets
OWNX--: this paper we consider problem reconstructing symbol low rank matrix symbol small set observed entries
MISC--: this problem considerable practical interest many applications
MISC--: one example collaborative filtering where users submit rankings small subsets say movies goal infer preference unrated movies recommendation system citation
OWNX--: believed movie rating matrix approximately low rank since only few factors contribute user s preferences
MISC--: other examples matrix completion include problem inferring dimensional structure motion citation triangulation incomplete data distances between wireless sensors also known sensor localization problem citation citation
