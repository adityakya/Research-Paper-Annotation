AIMX--: paper proposes new message passing algorithm cycle free factor graphs
MISC--: proposed entropy message passing emp algorithm may viewed sum product message passing over entropy semiring previously appeared automata theory
MISC--: primary use emp compute entropy model
OWNX--: however emp also used compute expressions appear expectation maximization gradient descent algorithms
MISC--: efficient marginalization multivariate function important many areas including signal processing artificial intelligence digital communications
MISC--: when cycle free factor graph representation function available then exact marginals computed sum product message passing factor graph citation citation
MISC--: fact number well known algorithms special cases sum product message passing
MISC--: sum product sum product message passing may belong arbitrary commutative semiring citation citation
AIMX--: this paper we propose use entropy semiring resulting algorithm will called entropy message passing emp
MISC--: entropy semiring was introduced cortes et al citation compute relative entropy between probabilistic automata
AIMX--: this paper we translate ideas citation into language factor graphs message passing algorithms
CONT--: primary use emp compute entropy model cycle free factor graph fixed observations
AIMX--: main prior work this subject hernando et al citation again main point present paper clarify generalize this prior work reformulating terms sum product message passing
MISC--: however emp also used compute expressions appear expectation maximization gradient ascent algorithms citation citation this connection appears new
AIMX--: paper structured follows
OWNX--: section ii we review sum product message passing over commutative semiring
OWNX--: section iii we introduce entropy semiring
OWNX--: emp algorithm described section iv mentioned applications described section v
