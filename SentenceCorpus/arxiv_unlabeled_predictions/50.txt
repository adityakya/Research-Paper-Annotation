MISC--: this chapter article gives introduction mathematical theory intelligence
OWNX--: we present aixi model parameter free optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded arbitrary unknown environment
MISC--: science artificial intelligence ai may defined construction intelligent systems their analysis
MISC--: natural definition system anything input output stream
MISC--: intelligence more complicated
MISC--: many faces like creativity solving problems pattern recognition classification learning induction deduction building analogies optimization surviving environment language processing knowledge many more
CONT--: formal definition incorporating every aspect intelligence however seems difficult
MISC--: most if not all known facets intelligence formulated goal driven more precisely maximizing some utility function
MISC--: therefore sufficient study goal driven ai eg biological goal animals humans survive spread
MISC--: goal ai systems should useful humans
OWNX--: problem except special cases we know neither utility function nor environment agent will operate advance
MISC--: mathematical theory coined aixi supposed solve problems
MISC--: assume availability unlimited computational resources
OWNX--: first important observation this does not make ai problem trivial
MISC--: playing chess optimally solving np complete problems become trivial but driving car surviving nature don t
OWNX--: this because challenge itself well define latter problems not mention presenting algorithm
MISC--: other words ai problem not yet been well defined
MISC--: one may view aixi suggestion mathematical definition ai
MISC--: aixi universal theory sequential decision making akin solomonoff s celebrated universal theory induction
MISC--: solomonoff derived optimal way predicting future data given previous perceptions provided data sampled computable probability distribution

MISC--: aixi universal theory without adjustable parameters making no assumptions about environment except sampled computable distribution
MISC--: algorithmic complexity perspective aixi model generalizes optimal passive universal induction case active agents
MISC--: decision theoretic perspective aixi suggestion new implicit learning algorithm may overcome all except computational problems previous reinforcement learning algorithms

MISC--: article meant gentle introduction discussion aixi model
MISC--: mathematically rigorous treatment many subtleties proofs see references author s works annotated bibliography section at end this chapterarticle fi particular book citation

MISC--: presents theory sequential decisions very general form called ai symbol model actions perceptions may depend arbitrary past events
OWNX--: we clarify connection bellman equations discuss minor parameters including size i o spaces lifetime agent their universal choice we mind
OWNX--: optimality ai symbol obvious construction
OWNX--: how sense induction possible at all been subject long philosophical controversies
MISC--: highlights epicurus principle multiple explanations occam s razor probability theory
MISC--: solomonoff elegantly unified all aspects into one formal theory inductive inference based universal probability distribution symbol closely related kolmogorov complexity symbol length shortest program computing symbol
MISC--: rapid convergence symbol unknown true environmental distribution symbol tight loss bounds arbitrary bounded loss functions finite alphabet shown
MISC--: pareto optimality symbol sense there no other predictor performs better equal all environments strictly better at least one also shown
MISC--: view results fair say problem sequence prediction possesses universally optimal solution
MISC--: active case reinforcement learning algorithms usually used if symbol unknown
MISC--: they succeed if state space either small effectively been made small generalization techniques

OWNX--: formal solution proposed here generalize solomonoff s universal prior symbol include action conditions replace symbol symbol ai symbol model resulting ai symbol aixi model we claim universally optimal
OWNX--: we investigate what we expect universally optimal agent clarify meanings universal optimal etc
MISC--: other discussed topics formal definitions intelligence order relation horizon problem pareto optimality aixi
OWNX--: we show how number ai problem classes fit into general aixi model

OWNX--: we first formulate each problem class its natural way known symbol then construct formulation within ai symbol model show their equivalence
OWNX--: we then consider consequences replacing symbol symbol
OWNX--: main goal understand sense problems solved aixi
MISC--: major drawback aixi incomputable more precisely only asymptotically computable makes implementation impossible
CONT--: overcome this problem we construct modified model aixi symbol still superior any other time symbol length symbol bounded algorithm
MISC--: computation time aixi symbol order symbol
OWNX--: solution requires implementation first order logic definition universal turing machine within proof theory system
OWNX--: finally we discuss remark some otherwise unmentioned topics general interest
OWNX--: we remark various topics including concurrent actions perceptions choice i o spaces treatment encrypted information peculiarities mortal embodies agents
OWNX--: we continue outlook further research including optimality down scaling implementation approximation elegance extra knowledge training aixi symbol
