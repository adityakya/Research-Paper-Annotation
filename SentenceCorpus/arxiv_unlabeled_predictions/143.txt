AIMX--: this paper we propose miml multi instance multi label learning
MISC--: framework where example described multiple instances associated
MISC--: multiple class labels
OWNX--: compared traditional learning frameworks miml
MISC--: framework more convenient natural representing complicated objects
OWNX--: multiple semantic meanings
OWNX--: learn miml examples we propose
MISC--: textsc mimlboost textsc mimlsvm algorithms based simple degeneration
OWNX--: strategy experiments show solving problems involving complicated objects
MISC--: multiple semantic meanings miml framework lead good performance
MISC--: considering degeneration process may lose information we propose
MISC--: textsc d mimlsvm algorithm tackles miml problems directly regularization
MISC--: framework
OWNX--: moreover we show even when we do not access real objects
MISC--: thus cannot capture more information real objects using miml
MISC--: representation miml still useful
OWNX--: we propose textsc insdif
MISC--: textsc subcod algorithms textsc insdif works transforming single instances into
MISC--: miml representation learning while textsc subcod works transforming
MISC--: single label examples into miml representation learning
OWNX--: experiments show
MISC--: some tasks they able achieve better performance than learning
MISC--: single instances single label examples directly
MISC--: traditional supervised learning object represented instance
MISC--: i e feature vector associated class label
MISC--: formally let symbol
MISC--: denote instance space feature space symbol set class labels
MISC--: task learn function symbol given data set
MISC--: symbol where symbol instance symbol known label symbol
MISC--: although this formalization prevailing successful there many real world
OWNX--: problems do not fit this framework well
OWNX--: particular each object this
MISC--: framework belongs only one concept therefore corresponding instance
MISC--: associated single class label
MISC--: however many real world objects complicated
MISC--: may belong multiple concepts simultaneously
MISC--: example image belong
MISC--: several classes simultaneously eg grasslands lions
MISC--: africa etc text document classified several categories if
MISC--: viewed different aspects eg scientific novel jules verne s
MISC--: writing even books traveling web page recognized
MISC--: news page sports page soccer page etc
MISC--: specific real
OWNX--: task maybe only one multiple concepts right semantic meaning
MISC--: 
MISC--: example image retrieval when user interested image lions s he may
MISC--: only interested concept lions instead other concepts
MISC--: grasslands africa associated image
MISC--: difficulty here
MISC--: caused those objects involve multiple concepts
MISC--: choose right semantic meaning objects specific scenario fundamental difficulty many tasks
OWNX--: contrast starting large universe all possible concepts involved task may helpful get subset concepts associated concerned object at first then make choice small subset later
MISC--: however getting subset concepts assigning proper class labels objects still challenging task
OWNX--: we notice alternative representing object single instance
MISC--: many cases possible represent complicated object using set instances
MISC--: example multiple patches extracted image where each patch
MISC--: described instance thus image represented set instances
OWNX--: multiple sections extracted document where each section described
OWNX--: instance thus document represented set instances multiple
MISC--: links extracted web page where each link described instance
MISC--: thus web page represented set instances
MISC--: using multiple instances
MISC--: represent those complicated objects may helpful because some inherent patterns
MISC--: closely related some labels may become explicit clearer
AIMX--: this paper we propose miml multi instance multi label learning
MISC--: framework where example described multiple instances associated
MISC--: multiple class labels
MISC--: compared traditional learning frameworks miml framework more convenient
OWNX--: natural representing complicated objects
MISC--: exploit advantages miml
MISC--: representation new learning algorithms needed
OWNX--: we propose textsc mimlboost
OWNX--: algorithm textsc mimlsvm algorithm based simple degeneration strategy
OWNX--: experiments show solving problems involving complicated objects multiple
MISC--: semantic meanings under miml framework lead good performance
MISC--: considering
OWNX--: degeneration process may lose information we also propose
MISC--: textsc d mimlsvm i e direct textsc mimlsvm algorithm tackles miml
MISC--: problems directly regularization framework
OWNX--: experiments show this direct
CONT--: algorithm outperforms indirect textsc mimlsvm algorithm
OWNX--: some practical tasks we do not access real objects themselves
OWNX--: real images real web pages instead we given observational data where
OWNX--: each real object already been represented single instance
MISC--: thus cases
MISC--: we cannot capture more information real objects using miml representation
CONT--: even this situation however miml still useful
OWNX--: we propose textsc insdif
MISC--: i e instance differentiation algorithm transforms single instances into miml
MISC--: examples learning
MISC--: this algorithm able achieve better performance than
MISC--: learning single instances directly some tasks
OWNX--: this not strange because
MISC--: object associated multiple class labels if described only single
MISC--: instance information corresponding labels mixed thus difficult
MISC--: learning if we transform single instance into set instances some
MISC--: proper ways mixed information might detached some extent thus less
MISC--: difficult learning
MISC--: miml also helpful learning single label objects
OWNX--: we propose
OWNX--: textsc subcod i e sub concept discovery algorithm works discovering
OWNX--: sub concepts target concept at first then transforming data into miml
MISC--: examples learning
MISC--: this algorithm able achieve better performance than
MISC--: learning single label examples directly some tasks
OWNX--: this also not strange
MISC--: because label corresponding high level complicated concept may quite
MISC--: difficult learn this concept directly since many different lower level concepts
MISC--: mixed if we transform single label into set labels corresponding some
OWNX--: sub concepts relatively clearer easier learning we learn
OWNX--: labels at first then derive high level complicated label based them
MISC--: less difficulty
