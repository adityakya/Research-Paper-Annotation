MISC--: probabilistic grammatical inference usual goal infer good approximation unknown distribution symbol called stochastic language
MISC--: estimate symbol stands some class probabilistic models probabilistic automata pa
AIMX--: this paper we focus probabilistic models based multiplicity automata ma
MISC--: stochastic languages generated ma called rational stochastic languages they strictly include stochastic languages generated pa they also admit very concise canonical representation
CONT--: despite fact this class not recursively enumerable efficiently identifiable limit using algorithm dees introduced authors previous paper
MISC--: however identification not proper before convergence algorithm dees produce ma do not define stochastic languages
MISC--: nevertheless possible use ma define stochastic languages
AIMX--: we show they belong broader class rational series we call pseudo stochastic rational languages
OWNX--: aim this paper twofold
OWNX--: first we provide theoretical study pseudo stochastic rational languages languages output dees showing example this class decidable within polynomial time
OWNX--: second we carried out lot experiments order compare dees classical inference algorithms alergia mdi
MISC--: they show dees outperforms them most cases keywords pseudo stochastic rational languages multiplicity automata probabilistic grammatical inference
OWNX--: probabilistic grammatical inference we often consider stochastic languages define distributions over symbol set all possible words over alphabet symbol
OWNX--: general we consider unknown distribution symbol goal find good approximation given finite sample words independently drawn symbol
MISC--: class probabilistic automata pa often used modeling distributions
MISC--: this class same expressiveness hidden markov models identifiable limit citation
CONT--: however there exists no efficient algorithm identifying pa
CONT--: this explained fact there exists no canonical representation automata makes difficult correctly identify structure target
MISC--: one solution focus subclasses pa probabilistic deterministic automata citation but important lack expressiveness
MISC--: another solution consists considering class multiplicity automata ma
MISC--: models admit canonical representation offers good opportunities machine learning point view
OWNX--: ma define functions compute rational series values symbol citation
MISC--: ma strict generalization pa stochastic languages generated pa special cases rational stochastic languages
MISC--: let us denote symbol class rational stochastic languages computed ma parameters symbol where symbol
MISC--: symbol symbol symbol exactly class stochastic languages generated pa parameters symbol
OWNX--: but when symbol symbol we obtain strictly greater classes
BASE--: this provides several advantages elements symbol minimal normal representation thus elements symbol may significantly smaller representation symbol parameters minimal representations directly related probabilities some natural events form symbol efficiently estimated stochastic samples lastly when symbol field rational series over symbol form vector space efficient linear algebra techniques used deal rational stochastic languages
MISC--: however class symbol presents serious drawback there exists no recursively enumerable subset class ma exactly generates citation
MISC--: consequence no proper identification algorithm exist indeed applying proper identification algorithm enumeration samples symbol would provide enumeration class rational stochastic languages over symbol
MISC--: spite this result there exists efficient algorithm dees able identify symbol limit
MISC--: but before reaching target dees produce ma do not define stochastic languages
MISC--: however been shown citation probability one any rational stochastic language symbol if dees given input sufficiently large sample symbol drawn according symbol dees outputs rational series symbol converges absolutely
MISC--: moreover symbol converges size symbol increases
AIMX--: we show ma belong broader class rational series we call pseudo stochastic rational languages
MISC--: pseudo stochastic rational language symbol property symbol defined any word symbol symbol
MISC--: stochastic language symbol associated symbol way symbol when sum symbol absolutely convergent
MISC--: first consequence symbol when symbol stochastic language
MISC--: second consequence any rational stochastic language symbol if dees given input increasing samples drawn according symbol dees outputs pseudo stochastic rational languages symbol symbol converges size symbol increases
AIMX--: aim this paper twofold provide theoretical study class pseudo stochastic rational languages series experiments order compare performance dees two classical inference algorithms alergia citation mdi citation
AIMX--: we show class pseudo stochastic rational languages decidable within polynomial time
OWNX--: we provide algorithm used compute symbol any ma computes symbol
OWNX--: we also show how possible simulate symbol using automaton
OWNX--: we show there exist pseudo stochastic rational languages symbol symbol not rational
AIMX--: finally we show undecidable whether two pseudo stochastic rational languages define same stochastic language
OWNX--: we carried out lot experiments show dees outperforms alergia mdi most cases
OWNX--: results were expected since alergia mdi not same theoretical expressiveness since dees aims at producing minimal representation target set ma significantly smaller than smaller equivalent pda if exists
AIMX--: paper organized follows
OWNX--: section we introduce some background about multiplicity automata rational series stochastic languages present algorithm dees
OWNX--: section deals our study pseudo rational stochastic languages
OWNX--: our experiments detailed section
