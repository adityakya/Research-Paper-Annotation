MISC--: knn one most popular classification methods but often fails work well inappropriate choice distance metric due presence numerous class irrelevant features
MISC--: linear feature transformation methods been widely applied extract class relevant information improve knn classification very limited many applications
MISC--: kernels been used learn powerful non linear feature transformations but methods fail scale large datasets
AIMX--: this paper we present scalable non linear feature mapping method based deep neural network pretrained restricted boltzmann machines improving knn classification large margin framework we call dnet knn
OWNX--: dnet knn used both classification supervised dimensionality reduction
MISC--: experimental results two benchmark handwritten digit datasets show dnet knn much better performance than large margin knn using linear mapping knn based deep autoencoder pretrained retricted boltzmann machines
MISC--: knn one most popular classification methods due its simplicity reasonable effectiveness doesn t require fitting model been shown good performance classifying many types data
MISC--: however good classification performance knn highly dependent metric used computing pairwise distances between data points
OWNX--: practice we often use euclidean distances similarity metric calculate k nearest neighbors data points interest
OWNX--: classify high dimensional data real applications we often need learn choose good distance metric
CONT--: previous work metric learning citation citation learns global linear transformation matrix original feature space data points make similar data points stay closer while making dissimilar data points move farther apart using additional similarity label information
MISC--: citation global linear transformation applied original feature space data points learn mahalanobis metrics requires all data points same class collapse one point
MISC--: making data points same class collapse one point unnecessary knn classification
MISC--: may produce poor performance when data points cannot essentially collapsed points often true some class containing multiple patterns
MISC--: information theoretic based approach used learn linear transformations citation
MISC--: citation global linear transformation learned directly improve knn classification achieve goal large margin
MISC--: this method been shown yield significant improvement over knn classification but linear transformation often fails give good performance high dimensional space pre processing dimensionality reduction step pca often required success
MISC--: many situations linear transformation not powerful enough capture underlying class specific data manifold thus we need resort more powerful non linear transformations so each data point will stay closer its nearest neighbors having same class itself than any other data non linearly transformed feature space
MISC--: kernel tricks been used kernelize some above methods order improve knn classification citation
MISC--: method citation extends work citation perform linear dimensionality reduction improve large margin knn classification kernelized method citation
MISC--: however kernel based approaches behave almost like template based approaches
MISC--: if chosen kernel cannot well reflect true class related structure data resulting performance will bad
MISC--: besides kernel based approaches often difficulty handling large datasets
OWNX--: we might want achieve non linear mappings learning directed multi layer belief net deep autoencoder then perform knn classification using hidden distributed representations original input data
MISC--: however multi layer belief net often suffers explaining away effect top hidden units become dependent conditional bottom visible units makes inference intractable learning deep autoencoder backpropagation amost impossible because gradient backpropagated lower layers output often becomes very noisy meaningless
MISC--: fortunately recent research shown training deep generative model called deep belief net feasible pretraining deep net using type undirected graphical model called restricted boltzmann machine rbm citation
MISC--: rbms produce complementary priors make inference process deep belief net much easier deep net trained greedily layer layer using simple efficient learning rule rbm
MISC--: greedy layerwise pretraining strategy made learning models deep architures possible citation
MISC--: moreover greedy pretraining idea also been successfully applied initialize weights deep autoencoder learn very powerful non linear mapping dimensionality reduction illustrated fig b
MISC--: besides idea deep learning motivated researchers use powerful generative models deep architectures learn better discriminative models citation
AIMX--: this paper combining idea deep learning large margin discriminative learning we propose new knn classification supervised dimensionality reduction method called dnet knn
MISC--: learns non linear feature transformation directly achieve goal large margin knn classification based deep encoder network pretrained rbms shown fig
BASE--: our approach mainly inspired work citation citation citation
MISC--: given labels some all training data allows us learn non linear feature mapping minimize invasions each data point s genuine neighborhood other impostor nearest neighbors favours knn classification directly
MISC--: previous researchers once used autoencoder deep autoencoder non linear dimensionality reduction improve knn citation
OWNX--: none approaches used objective function direct what we use here improving knn classification
MISC--: approach discussed citation uses convolution net learn similarity metric discriminatively but was handcrafted
OWNX--: our approach based general deep neural networks more flexible connection weight matrices between layers automatically learned data
OWNX--: we applied dnet knn usps mnist handwritten digit datasets classification
OWNX--: test error we obtained mnist benchmark dataset symbol better than obtained deep belief net deep autoencoder svm citation
MISC--: addition our fine tuning process very fast converges good local minimum within several iterations conjugate gradient update
OWNX--: our experimental results show good generative model used pretraining stage improve discriminative learning pretraining generative models layerwise greedy way makes possible learn good discriminative model deep architecture pretraining rbms makes discriminative learning process much faster than without pretraining pretraining helps find much better local minimum than without pretraining
