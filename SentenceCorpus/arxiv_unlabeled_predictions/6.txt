OWNX--: we show residual languages rational stochastic language symbol over symbol also rational over symbol
MISC--: residual subsemimodule symbol symbol spanned residual languages any stochastic language symbol may used express rationality symbol symbol rational iff symbol included finitely generated subsemimodule symbol
