MISC--: this work motivated necessity automate discovery structure vast ever growing collection relational data commonly represented graphs example genomic networks
AIMX--: novel algorithm dubbed graphitour structure induction lossless graph compression presented illustrated clear broadly known case nested structure dna molecule
CONT--: this work extends graphs some well established approaches grammatical inference previously applied only strings
MISC--: bottom up graph compression problem related maximum cardinality non bipartite maximum cardinality matching problem
MISC--: algorithm accepts variety graph types including directed graphs graphs labeled nodes arcs
MISC--: resulting structure could used representation classification graphs
MISC--: explosive growth relational data example data about genes drug molecules proteins their functions interactions necessitates efficient mathematical algorithms software tools extract meaningful generalizations
MISC--: there large body literature subject coming variety disciplines theoretical computer science computational chemistry
MISC--: however one fundametal issue so far remained unaddressed
MISC--: given multi level nested network relations complex molecule protein protein interaction network how its structure inferred first principles
AIMX--: this paper meant fill this surprising gap automated data processing
OWNX--: let us illustrate purpose this method through description dna molecular structure way most us learned textbook class
OWNX--: dna molecule double chain made four kinds nucleotides t g c each composed two parts one part backbone identical among all nucleotides neglecting difference between ribose deoxyribose another heterocyclic base nucleotide specific backbone consists sugar phosphate heterocyclic bases c t pyrimidines g purines all contain pyrimidine ring components further reduced individual atoms covalent bonds
OWNX--: this way description not unique may altered according desired level detail but crucially hieararchical description whole structure built identifiable repetitive subcomponents
OWNX--: picture this beautiful multi level hierarchy emerged after years bio chemical discovery scientists who gradually applied their natural abstraction generalization abilities
MISC--: hence structural elements this hierarchy also make functional sense bio chemical point view properties hierarchical description formally well studied applied other scientific domains linguistics computer science
MISC--: viewed result rule driven generative process combines finite set undecomposable elements terminal symbols into novel complex objects non terminal symbols combined turn produce next level description
MISC--: rules symbols process operates determined grammar process itself termed grammatical derivation
OWNX--: case dna molecule above chemical elements correspond terminal symbols
MISC--: they assembled into non terminal symbols i e compounds according some set production rules defined chemical properties
OWNX--: now imagine receiving alternative description same object stripped off any domain knowledge context simply enormous list objects binary relations objects corresponding thousands atoms covalent bonds
MISC--: list would remain completely incomprehensible human mind along any repetitive hierarchical structure present
MISC--: discovering hierarchy nested elements without any prior knowledge kind size frequency constitutes formidable challenge
OWNX--: remarkably this precisely challenge undertaken contemporary scientists trying make sense data mounting up small fragments like protein interaction networks regulatory metabolic pathways small molecule repositories homology networks etc
OWNX--: our goal able approach tasks automated fashion
OWNX--: figure illustrates kind induction we describe this paper trivial example
AIMX--: we will use this running example throughout paper leaving more rigorous mathematical formulation out purpose clarity wider accessibility
MISC--: left graph contains repetitive structure
MISC--: let us imagine moment human researcher not smart enough comprehend node graph find explanatory layout
OWNX--: thus we would want automatically translate graph into graph grammar right
MISC--: graph grammar consist two productions
MISC--: first expands starting representation degenerate graph single node s into graph connecting two nodes same type s
MISC--: second additionally defines node s fully connected triple formal description relational data kind known graphs while hierarchical nested structures kind described graph grammars
AIMX--: outside scope this paper survey vast literature field graph grammars please refer book g
MISC--: rozenberg citation extensive overview
MISC--: suffices say this field mostly concerned transformation graphs parsing i e explaining away graph according some known graph grammar rather than inducing grammar raw data
MISC--: closest work related ideas presented here due d
MISC--: cook l
MISC--: holder their colleagues e g see citation several follow up papers
MISC--: their work however not concerned inducing structure given graph data
OWNX--: rather they induce flat context free grammar possibly recursion not only capable but also bound generate objects not included original data
MISC--: thus their approach defies relation compression exploited here
AIMX--: moreover authors present negative result running their subdue algorithm just kind biological data we successfully use this paper
MISC--: another remotely similar work stolke citation application inducing hidden markov models
MISC--: there many other works attempting induce structure relational data compress graphs but none seem relate closely method considered here
OWNX--: our method builds parallels between understanding compression
OWNX--: indeed understand some phenomenon raw data means find some repetitive pattern hierarchical structure turn could exploited re encode data compact way
CONT--: this work extends graphs some well established approaches grammatical inference previously applied only strings
MISC--: two methods particularly worth mentioning this context grammar induction sequences sequitour citation adios citation
OWNX--: we also take inspiration wealth sequence compression algorithms often unknowingly run daily all computer users form archival software like pkzip unix expand mac os x
MISC--: winzip windows
MISC--: let us briefly convey intuition behind algorithms many surveyed lehman shelat citation
MISC--: although quite different detail all algorithms share common principles very similar compression ratio computational complexity bounds
MISC--: first one remember all compression discovery algorithms bound heuristics since finding best compression related so called kolmogorov complexity provably hard citation
OWNX--: heuristics turn related mdl minimum description length principle work way described table naturally difference how exactly statistics used pick substring will substituted new compound symbol
OWNX--: some cases greedy strategy used see eg apostolico lonardi citation i e substitution will maximally reduce size encoding at current step picked other cases simple first come first served principle used any repetition immediately eliminated see eg nevill manning witten citation
MISC--: extending methods graph structure turns out non trivial several reasons
OWNX--: first maintaining lexicon strings looking up entries quite different graphs
MISC--: second directly extending greedy approach citation fails due inherent non linear entity interactions graph
