MISC--: binary classification problem two popular settings
OWNX--: particular we provide bounds sample complexity maximum margin
MISC--: classifiers when magnitude entries feature vector decays
MISC--: according power law also when learning performed
MISC--: so called diffusion maps kernel
OWNX--: both results rely bounding annealed entropy gap tolerant
MISC--: classifiers hilbert space
OWNX--: we provide bound we demonstrate our proof technique

MISC--: general banach space norms

MISC--: two popular settings
MISC--: both cases
OWNX--: we able obtain nearly optimal linear classification hyperplanes since
