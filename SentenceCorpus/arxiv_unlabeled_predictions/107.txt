MISC--: kolmogorov argued concept information exists also problems no underlying stochastic model shannon s information representation instance information contained algorithm genome
MISC--: he introduced combinatorial notion entropy information symbol conveyed binary string symbol about unknown value variable symbol
AIMX--: current paper poses following questions what relationship between information conveyed symbol about symbol description complexity symbol
MISC--: there notion cost information
MISC--: there limits how efficient symbol conveys information
MISC--: answer questions kolmogorov s definition extended new concept termed information width similar symbol widths approximation theory introduced
MISC--: information any input source eg sample based general side information hybrid both evaluated single common formula
MISC--: application space binary functions considered
MISC--: kolmogorov citation sought measure information finite objects
MISC--: he considered three approaches so called combinatorial probabilistic algorithmic
MISC--: probabilistic approach corresponds well established definition shannon entropy applies stochastic settings where object represented random variable
MISC--: this setting entropy object information conveyed one object about another well defined
MISC--: here necessary view object finite binary string realization stochastic process
MISC--: while this often been used instance measure information english texts citation assuming some finite order markov process not obvious modeling finite objects provides natural universal representation information kolmogorov states citation what real meaning there example asking how much information contained book war peace
MISC--: reasonable
MISC--: 
MISC--: 
MISC--: postulate some probability distribution this set
MISC--: other hand must we assume individual scenes this book form random sequence stochastic relations damp out quite rapidly over distance several pages
MISC--: questions led kolmogorov introduce alternate non probabilistic algorithmic notion information contained finite binary string
MISC--: he defined length minimal size program compute string
MISC--: this been later developed into so called kolmogorov complexity field citation
MISC--: combinatorial approach kolmogorov investigated another non stochastic measure information object symbol
MISC--: here symbol taken any element finite space symbol objects
MISC--: citation he defines entropy symbol symbol where symbol denotes cardinality symbol all logarithms henceforth taken respect symbol
MISC--: he writes if value symbol known symbol then this much entropy eliminated providing symbol bits information
MISC--: let symbol general finite domain consider set ar consists all allowed values pairs symbol
MISC--: entropy symbol defined symbol where pi y x y text some x bx denotes projection symbol symbol
MISC--: consider restriction symbol symbol based symbol defined y x y x y x pi bx then conditional combinatorial entropy symbol given symbol defined h x y x
MISC--: kolmogorov defines information conveyed symbol about symbol quantity i x h h x
MISC--: alternatively we may view symbol information set symbol conveys about another set symbol satisfying symbol
MISC--: this case we let domain symbol symbol set permissible pairs symbol information defined i y x log pi log y x pi
OWNX--: we will refer this representation kolmogorov s information between sets
MISC--: clearly symbol
MISC--: many applications knowing input symbol only conveys partial information about unknown value symbol
MISC--: instance problems involve analysis algorithms discrete classes structures sets binary vectors functions finite domain algorithmic search made some optimal element this set based only partial information
MISC--: one paradigm area statistical pattern recognition citation where unknown target i e pattern classifier seeked based information contained finite sample some side information
MISC--: this information implicit particular set classifiers form possible hypotheses
MISC--: example let symbol positive integer consider domain symbol
OWNX--: let symbol set all binary functions symbol
OWNX--: power set symbol represents family all sets symbol
OWNX--: repeating this we symbol collection all properties sets symbol i e property set whose elements subsets symbol symbol
OWNX--: we denote symbol property set symbol write symbol
OWNX--: suppose we seek know unknown target function symbol
MISC--: any partial information about symbol may expressed symbol effectively reduce search space
MISC--: been long standing problem try quantify value general side information learning see citation references therein
OWNX--: we assert kolmogorov s combinatorial framework may serve basis
OWNX--: we let symbol index possible properties symbol subsets symbol object symbol represent unknown target symbol may any element symbol
MISC--: side information then represented knowing certain properties sets contain target
MISC--: input symbol conveys symbol some subset symbol certain property symbol
MISC--: principle kolmogorov s quantity symbol should serve value information symbol about unknown value symbol
MISC--: however its current form not general enough since requires target symbol restricted fixed set symbol knowledge symbol
MISC--: see this suppose symbol set satisfies property symbol
OWNX--: consider collection symbol all subsets symbol this property
OWNX--: clearly symbol hence we may first consider symbol but some useful information implicit this collection ignored we now show consider two properties symbol symbol corresponding index sets symbol symbol symbol
MISC--: suppose most sets symbol symbol small while sets symbol symbol large
MISC--: clearly property symbol more informative than symbol since starting knowledge symbol set satisfies should take average less additional information once particular set symbol becomes known order completely specify symbol
OWNX--: if above we let symbol symbol then we symbol wrongly implies both properties equally informative
MISC--: knowing symbol provides implicit information associated collection possible sets symbol symbol
MISC--: this implicit structural information cannot represented
