MISC--: suppose signal symbol realized driving symbol sparse signal symbol through arbitrary unknown stable discrete linear time invariant system symbol namely symbol where symbol impulse response operator symbol
MISC--: types processes arise naturally reflection seismology
OWNX--: this paper we interested several problems blind deconvolution we recover both filter symbol sparse signal symbol noisy measurements b compressive sensing symbol compressible conventional sense compressed sensing
MISC--: namely symbol reconstructed sparse set measurements
OWNX--: we develop novel symbol minimization methods solve both cases establish sufficient conditions exact recovery case when unknown system symbol auto regressive i e all pole known order
OWNX--: compressed sensing sampling setting turns out both symbol symbol reconstructed symbol measurements under certain technical conditions support structure symbol
CONT--: our main idea pass symbol through linear time invariant system symbol collect symbol sequential measurements
MISC--: filter symbol chosen suitably namely its associated toeplitz matrix satisfies rip property
OWNX--: we develop novel lp optimization algorithm show both unknown filter symbol sparse input symbol reliably estimated
OWNX--: this paper we focus blind de convolution problems filtered sparse processes
OWNX--: specifically sparse input symbol filtered unknown infinite impulse response iir discrete time stable linear filter symbol resulting output symbol symbol y t x t n t symbol t ldots n symbol u t symbol h symbol x t symbol u t symbol h symbol h symbol h symbol h symbol z symbol h symbol ell symbol h symbol u symbol h symbol u symbol x t symbol x t symbol u t symbol h symbol z symbol o k log n symbol gh symbol h symbol hu symbol x symbol symbol alpha alpha symbol alpha symbol x symbol u t x t x t symbol x symbol h symbol u symbol x hu symbol h symbol x symbol g symbol g t symbol symbol symbol g h symbol symbol symbol u gu symbol g symbol g symbol u symbol h symbol h symbol h symbol u t symbol u t symbol u t symbol ell symbol symbol symbol ell symbol u symbol ell symbol ell symbol symbol symbol h symbol u symbol h symbol h perp symbol p symbol g h h g symbol ell symbol u symbol p symbol m symbol o m p symbol o mp symbol ell minimization algorithm main result this paper theorem stated this section
