AIMX--: we present bayesum bayesian summarization model sentence extraction query focused summarization bayesum leverages common case multiple documents relevant single query
MISC--: using documents reinforcement query terms bayesum not afflicted paucity information short queries
OWNX--: we show approximate inference bayesum possible large data sets results state art summarization system
AIMX--: furthermore we show how bayesum understood justified query expansion technique language modeling ir framework
MISC--: we describe bayesum algorithm performing query focused summarization common case there many relevant documents given query
BASE--: given query collection relevant documents our algorithm functions asking itself following question what about relevant documents differentiates them non relevant documents bayesum seen providing statistical formulation this exact question
MISC--: key requirement bayesum multiple relevant documents known query question
OWNX--: this not severe limitation
MISC--: two well studied problems de facto standard
OWNX--: standard multidocument summarization without query we access known relevant documents some user need
MISC--: similarly case web search application underlying ir engine will retrieve multiple presumably relevant documents given query
MISC--: both tasks bayesum performs well even when underlying retrieval model noisy
MISC--: idea leveraging known relevant documents known query expansion information retrieval community where been shown successful ad hoc retrieval tasks
OWNX--: viewed perspective ir our work interpreted two ways
MISC--: first seen application query expansion summarization task ir terminology passage retrieval see citation
MISC--: second more importantly seen method query expansion non ad hoc manner
MISC--: bayesum statistically justified query expansion method language modeling ir framework citation
