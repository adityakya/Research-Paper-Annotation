OWNX--: we introduce simple framework learning aggressive maneuvers flight control uavs
MISC--: having inspired biological environment dynamic movement primitives analyzed extended using nonlinear contraction theory
OWNX--: accordingly primitives observed movement stably combined concatenated
OWNX--: we demonstrate our results experimentally quanser helicopter we first imitate aggressive maneuvers then use them primitives achieve new maneuvers fly over obstacle
MISC--: role uavs unmanned aerial vehicles gained significant importance last decades
MISC--: they many advantages agility low surface area ability work constrained dangerous places over their conventional precedents
MISC--: addition current uavs more biologically inspired terms shape performance because improvements electronics propulsion
OWNX--: unfortunately we still far away using their capacity at fullest
OWNX--: this mostly related weakness current control algorithms against high dimensional nonlinear environments
OWNX--: this sense generating aggressive maneuvers interesting hard accomplish
AIMX--: this paper our approach solve this issue designed view experiments frogs monkeys suggest we faced inverse kinematics algorithm adapts environment changes sequence target points irrespective initial conditions
BASE--: theory we analyzed dynamic movement primitives dmps citation combined them using contraction theory
MISC--: experiments obstacle avoidance dmp human piloted flight data segmented into parts combined at different initial points achieve maneuvers against different obstacles different locations
BASE--: background our work briefly detailed below
