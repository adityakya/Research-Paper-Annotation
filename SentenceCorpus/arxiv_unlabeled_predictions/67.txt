OWNX--: process training support vector machines svms decomposition methods working set selection important technique some exciting schemes were employed into this field
AIMX--: improve working set selection we propose new model working set selection sequential minimal optimization smo decomposition methods
OWNX--: this model selects symbol symbol working set without reselection
OWNX--: some properties given simple proof experiments demonstrate proposed method general faster than existing methods
MISC--: past few years there been huge interest support vector machines svms citation because they excellent generalization performance wide range problems
MISC--: key work training svms solve follow quadratic optimization problem
OWNX--: where symbol vector all ones symbol upper bound all variables symbol symbol kernel function
MISC--: notable effects been taken into training svms citation
CONT--: unlike most optimization methods update whole vector symbol each iteration decomposition method modifies only subset symbol per iteration
MISC--: each iteration variable indices split into working set symbol its complement symbol
MISC--: then sub problem variables symbol solved thereby leaving values remaining variables symbol unchanged
OWNX--: this method leads small sub problem minimized each iteration
MISC--: extreme case sequential minimal optimization smo citation restricts working set only two elements
MISC--: comparative tests against other algorithms done platt citation indicates smo often much faster better scaling properties
MISC--: since only few components updated per iteration difficult problems decomposition method suffers slow convergence
MISC--: better method working set selection reduce number iterations hence important research issue
MISC--: some methods were proposed solve this problem reduce time training svms citation
AIMX--: this paper we proposed we propose new model select working set
OWNX--: this model specially selects symbol without reselection
MISC--: another word once symbol selected they will not tested selected during following working set selection
MISC--: experiments demonstrate new model general faster than existing methods
AIMX--: this paper organized following
OWNX--: section ii we give literature review smo decomposition method existing working set selection both discussed
OWNX--: new method working set selection then presented section iii
MISC--: section iv experiments corresponding analysis given
OWNX--: finally section v concludes this paper
