MISC--: feature markov decision processes symbol mdps citation well suited learning agents general environments
OWNX--: nevertheless unstructured symbol mdps limited relatively simple environments
MISC--: structured mdps like dynamic bayesian networks dbns used large scale real world problems
MISC--: this article i extend symbol mdp symbol dbn
MISC--: primary contribution derive cost criterion allows automatically extract most relevant features environment leading best dbn representation
OWNX--: i discuss all building blocks required complete general learning algorithm
MISC--: keywords reinforcement learning dynamic bayesian network structure learning feature learning global vs local reward explore exploit
MISC--: agent environment setup agent interacts environment very general prevalent framework studying intelligent learning systems citation
MISC--: cycles symbol environment provides regular observation symbol e g camera image agent then agent chooses action symbol e g limb movement finally environment provides real valued reward symbol agent
MISC--: reward may very scarce eg just winning losing chess game at all other times citation
MISC--: then next cycle symbol starts
OWNX--: agent s objective maximize his reward
MISC--: example sequence prediction concerned environments do not react agents actions e g weather forecasting action citation planning deals case where environmental function known citation classification regression conditionally independent observations citation markov decision processes mdps assume symbol symbol only depend symbol symbol citation pomdps deal partially observable mdps citation dynamic bayesian networks dbns structured mdps citation
MISC--: concrete real world problems often modeled mdps
OWNX--: this purpose designer extracts relevant features history e g position velocity all objects i e history symbol summarized feature vector symbol
MISC--: feature vectors regarded states mdp assumed approximately markov
MISC--: artificial general intelligence agi citation concerned designing agents perform well very large range environments citation including all mentioned ones above more
CONT--: this general situation not priori clear what useful features
MISC--: indeed any observation far past may relevant future
MISC--: solution suggested citation learn symbol itself
MISC--: if symbol keeps too much history e g symbol resulting mdp too large infinite cannot learned
MISC--: if symbol keeps too little resulting state sequence not markov
MISC--: cost criterion i develop formalizes this tradeoff minimized best symbol
MISC--: at any time symbol best symbol one minimizes markov code length symbol symbol
MISC--: this reminds but actually quite different mdl minimizes model data code length citation
CONT--: use unstructured mdps citation even our symbol optimal ones clearly limited relatively simple tasks
MISC--: real world problems structured often represented dynamic bayesian networks dbns reasonable number nodes citation
MISC--: bayesian networks general dbns particular powerful tools modeling solving complex real world problems
MISC--: advances theory increase computation power constantly broaden their range applicability citation
MISC--: primary contribution this work extend symbol selection principle developed citation mdps conceptually much more demanding dbn case
MISC--: major extra complications approximating learning coding rewards dependence cost criterion dbn structure learning dbn structure how store find optimal value function policy
MISC--: although this article self contained recommended read citation first
