OWNX--: let symbol symbol matrix rank symbol assume uniformly random subset symbol its entries observed
OWNX--: we describe efficient algorithm reconstructs symbol symbol observed entries relative root mean square error symbol further if symbol symbol sufficiently unstructured then reconstructed exactly symbol entries
OWNX--: this settles case bounded rank question left open cand e s recht improves over guarantees their reconstruction algorithm
CONT--: complexity our algorithm symbol opens way its use massive data sets
OWNX--: process proving statements we obtain generalization celebrated result friedman kahn szemer edi feige ofek spectrum sparse random matrices
OWNX--: imagine each symbol customers watches rates subset symbol movies available through movie rental service
MISC--: this yields dataset customer movie pairs symbol each pair rating symbol
OWNX--: objective collaborative filtering predict rating missing pairs way provide targeted suggestions
MISC--: made public dataset symbol symbol symbol challenged research community predict missing ratings root mean square error below symbol citation general question we address here under conditions do known ratings provide sufficient information infer unknown ones
MISC--: this inference problem solved efficiently
MISC--: second question particularly important view massive size actual data sets
