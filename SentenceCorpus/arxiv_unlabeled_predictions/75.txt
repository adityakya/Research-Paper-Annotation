AIMX--: we show how rate distortion theory provides mechanism automated theory building naturally distinguishing between regularity randomness
OWNX--: we start simple principle model variables should much possible render future past conditionally independent
OWNX--: this we construct objective function model making whose extrema embody trade off between model s structural complexity its predictive power

MISC--: examples show how theory building profit analyzing process s causal compressibility reflected optimal models rate distortion curve process s characteristic optimally balancing structure noise at different levels representation
MISC--: progress science often driven discovery novel patterns
MISC--: historically physics relied creative mind theorist articulate mathematical models capture nature s regularities physical principles laws
MISC--: but last decade witnessed new era collecting truly vast data sets
MISC--: examples include contemporary experiments particle physics citation astronomy citation but range genomics automated language translation citation web social organization citation
CONT--: all volume data far exceeds what any human analyze directly hand
OWNX--: this presents new challenge automated pattern discovery model building
OWNX--: principled understanding model making critical provide theoretical guidance developing automated procedures
OWNX--: this letter we show how basic information theoretic optimality criteria provide method automatically constructing hierarchy models achieve different degrees abstraction
OWNX--: importantly we show appropriate limits method recovers process s causal organization
CONT--: without this connection would only another approach statistical inference its own ad hoc assumptions about character natural pattern
MISC--: our starting point observation natural systems store process produce information they compute intrinsically citation
MISC--: theory building then faces challenge extracting information structures underling its generation
CONT--: any physical theory delineates mechanism randomness identifying what part observed phenomenon due underlying process s structure what irrelevant
MISC--: irrelevant parts considered noise typically modeled probabilistically
MISC--: successful theory building therefore depends centrally deciding what structure what noise often implicit distinction
MISC--: what constitutes good theory though
MISC--: information relevant
MISC--: one answer this question time series prediction information about future time series relevant
MISC--: beyond forecasting though models often put test assessing how well they predict new data hence general importance model capture information aids prediction
MISC--: typically there many models explain given data set between two models equally predictive one favors simpler smaller less structurally complex model citation
MISC--: however more complex model achieve smaller prediction error than less complex model
MISC--: trade off between model complexity prediction error tantamount finding distinction between causal structure noise
MISC--: trade off between assigning causal mechanism occurrence event explaining event being merely random long history but how one implements trade off still very active topic
MISC--: nonlinear time series analysis citation take one example attempts account long range correlations produced nonlinear dynamical systems correlations not adequately modeled assumptions linearity independent identically distributed iid data
MISC--: success this endeavor requires directly addressing notion structure pattern citation
MISC--: examination essential goals prediction led principled definition structure captures dynamical system s causal organization part discovering underlying causal states citation
MISC--: computational mechanics process symbol viewed communication channel citation transmits information past symbol future symbol storing present
MISC--: purpose forecasting future two different pasts say symbol symbol equivalent if they result same prediction citation
MISC--: general this prediction probabilistic given conditional future distribution symbol
OWNX--: resulting equivalence relation symbol groups all histories give rise same conditional future distribution symbol resulting partition space symbol pasts defines process s causal states symbol
MISC--: causal states constitute model maximally predictive means capturing all information past time series contains about future
OWNX--: result knowing causal state renders past future conditionally independent property we call causal shielding because causal states markovian property they shield past future citation symbol where symbol
MISC--: this related fact causal state partition optimally predictive
OWNX--: see this note eq implies symbol
OWNX--: furthermore note definition any partition symbol symbol states symbol when past known then future distribution not altered history space partitioning symbol this implies causal states symbol thus symbol
MISC--: therefore causal shielding equivalent fact citation causal states capture all information symbol shared between past future symbol process s excess entropy symbol predictive information citation
MISC--: causal states unique minimal sufficient statistics time series prediction capturing all process s predictive information at maximum efficiency citation
MISC--: causal state partition smallest statistical complexity symbol compared all other equally predictive partitions symbol
MISC--: symbol measures minimal amount information must stored order communicate all excess entropy past future
OWNX--: briefly stated causal states serve basis against alternative models should compared
