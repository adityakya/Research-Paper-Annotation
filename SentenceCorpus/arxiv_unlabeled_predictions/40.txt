OWNX--: dimension reduction symbol method cauchy random projections multiplies original data matrix symbol random matrix symbol symbol whose entries iid
MISC--: samples standard cauchy symbol
OWNX--: because impossibility results one not hope recover pairwise symbol distances symbol symbol using linear estimators without incurring large errors
MISC--: however nonlinear estimators still useful certain applications data stream computation information retrieval learning data mining
OWNX--: we propose three types nonlinear estimators bias corrected sample median estimator bias corrected geometric mean estimator bias corrected maximum likelihood estimator
MISC--: sample median estimator geometric mean estimator asymptotically symbol equivalent but latter more accurate at small symbol
OWNX--: we derive explicit tail bounds geometric mean estimator establish analog johnson lindenstrauss jl lemma dimension reduction symbol weaker than classical jl lemma dimension reduction symbol
OWNX--: asymptotically both sample median estimator geometric mean estimators about symbol efficient compared maximum likelihood estimator mle
OWNX--: we analyze moments mle propose approximating distribution mle inverse gaussian
AIMX--: this paper focuses dimension reduction symbol particular method based cauchy random projections citation special case linear random projections
OWNX--: idea linear random projections multiply original data matrix symbol random projection matrix symbol resulting projected matrix symbol
MISC--: if symbol then should much more efficient compute certain summary statistics e g pairwise distances symbol opposed symbol
MISC--: moreover symbol may small enough reside physical memory while symbol often too large fit main memory
OWNX--: choice random projection matrix symbol depends norm we would like work
MISC--: citation proposed constructing symbol iid
MISC--: samples symbol stable distributions dimension reduction symbol symbol
BASE--: stable distribution family citation normal stable cauchy stable
OWNX--: thus we will call random projections symbol symbol normal random projections cauchy random projections respectively
OWNX--: normal random projections citation we estimate original pairwise symbol distances symbol directly using corresponding symbol distances symbol up normalizing constant
MISC--: furthermore johnson lindenstrauss jl lemma citation provides performance guarantee
OWNX--: we will review normal random projections more detail section
OWNX--: cauchy random projections we should not use symbol distance symbol approximate original symbol distance symbol cauchy distribution does not even finite first moment
MISC--: impossibility results citation proved one not hope recover symbol distance using linear projections linear estimators e g sample mean without incurring large errors
MISC--: fortunately impossibility results do not rule out nonlinear estimators may still useful certain applications data stream computation information retrieval learning data mining
MISC--: citation proposed using sample median instead sample mean cauchy random projections described its application data stream computation
OWNX--: this study we provide three types nonlinear estimators bias corrected sample median estimator bias corrected geometric mean estimator bias corrected maximum likelihood estimator
MISC--: sample median estimator geometric mean estimator asymptotically equivalent i e both about symbol efficient maximum likelihood estimator but latter more accurate at small sample size symbol
OWNX--: furthermore we derive explicit tail bounds bias corrected geometric mean estimator establish analog jl lemma dimension reduction symbol
MISC--: this analog jl lemma symbol weaker than classical jl lemma symbol geometric mean estimator non convex norm hence not metric
MISC--: many efficient algorithms some sub linear time using super linear memory nearest neighbor algorithms citation rely metric properties e g triangle inequality
MISC--: nevertheless nonlinear estimators may still useful important scenarios
OWNX--: estimating symbol distances online original data matrix symbol requires symbol storage space hence often too large physical memory
MISC--: storage cost all pairwise distances symbol may also too large memory
MISC--: example information retrieval symbol could total number word types documents at web scale
MISC--: avoid page fault may more efficient estimate distances fly projected data matrix symbol memory
OWNX--: computing all pairwise symbol distances distance based clustering classification applications we need compute all pairwise distances symbol at cost time symbol
MISC--: using cauchy random projections cost reduced symbol
MISC--: because symbol savings could enormous
OWNX--: linear scan nearest neighbor searching we always search nearest neighbors linear scans
MISC--: when working projected data matrix symbol memory cost searching nearest neighbor one data point time symbol may still significantly faster than sub linear algorithms working original data matrix symbol often disk
OWNX--: we briefly comment coordinate sampling another strategy dimension reduction
OWNX--: given data matrix symbol one randomly sample symbol columns symbol estimate summary statistics including symbol symbol distances
MISC--: despite its simplicity there two major disadvantages coordinate sampling
MISC--: first there no performance guarantee
OWNX--: heavy tailed data we may choose symbol very large order achieve sufficient accuracy
MISC--: second large datasets often highly sparse example text data citation market basket data citation
MISC--: citation citation provide alternative coordinate sampling strategy called conditional random sampling crs suitable sparse data
MISC--: non sparse data however methods based linear random projections superior

OWNX--: section summarizes main results three types nonlinear estimators
OWNX--: section presents sample median estimators
OWNX--: section concerns geometric mean estimators
OWNX--: section devoted maximum likelihood estimators
