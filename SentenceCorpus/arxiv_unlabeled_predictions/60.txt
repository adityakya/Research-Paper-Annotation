AIMX--: this paper uncovers explores close relationship between monte carlo optimization parametrized integral mco parametric machine learning pl blackbox oracle based optimization bo
OWNX--: we make four contributions
OWNX--: first we prove mco mathematically identical broad class pl problems
OWNX--: this identity potentially provides new application domain all broadly applicable pl techniques mco
OWNX--: second we introduce immediate sampling new version probability collectives pc algorithm blackbox optimization
MISC--: immediate sampling transforms original bo problem into mco problem
OWNX--: accordingly combining first two contributions we apply all pl techniques bo
OWNX--: our third contribution we validate this way improving bo demonstrating cross validation bagging improve immediate sampling
MISC--: finally conventional mc mco procedures ignore relationship between sample point locations associated values integrand only values integrand at those locations considered
OWNX--: we demonstrate one exploit sample location information using pl techniques example forming fit sample locations associated values integrand
OWNX--: this provides additional way apply pl techniques improve mco
AIMX--: this paper uncovers explores some aspects close relationship between monte carlo optimization parametrized integral mco parametric machine learning pl blackbox oracle based optimization bo
OWNX--: we make four primary contributions
OWNX--: first we establish mathematical identity equating mco pl
OWNX--: this identity potentially provides new application domain all broadly applicable pl techniques viz mco
OWNX--: our second contribution introduction immediate sampling
OWNX--: this new version probability collectives pc approach blackbox optimization
MISC--: pc encompasses estimation distribution algorithms edas citation cross entropy ce method citation special cases
MISC--: however pc broader more fully motivated
MISC--: this means uncovers overcomes formal shortcomings those other approaches
MISC--: immediate sampling version pc original bo problem transformed into mco problem
OWNX--: light our first contribution this means we apply pl immediate sampling
MISC--: this way symbol pl techniques including cross validation bagging boosting active learning stacking others applied blackbox optimization
OWNX--: our third contribution we experimentally explore power this identity between mco pl
OWNX--: experiments we demonstrate cross validation bagging improve performance immediate sampling blackbox optimization
OWNX--: particular experiments we show cross validation used adaptively set annealing schedule blackbox optimization using immediate sampling without any extra calls oracle
OWNX--: some cases we show this adaptively formed annealing schedule results better optimization performance than any exponential annealing schedule finally conventional mc mco procedures ignore relationship between sample point locations associated values integrand only values integrand at sample locations considered algorithms we end exploring ways use pl techniques exploit information sample locations instance bayesian fitting surface sample locations associated values integrand
MISC--: this constitutes yet another way applying pl mco general therefore bo particular
