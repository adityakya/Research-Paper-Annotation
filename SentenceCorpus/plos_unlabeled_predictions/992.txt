MISC--: some studies suggest complex arm movements humans monkeys may optimize several objective functions while others claim arm movements satisfy geometric constraints composed elementary components
MISC--: however ability unify different constraints remained open question
MISC--: criterion maximally smooth motion satisfied parabolic trajectories having constant equi affine speed thus comply geometric constraint known two thirds power law
OWNX--: here we empirically test hypothesis parabolic segments provide compact representation spontaneous drawing movements
MISC--: monkey scribblings performed during period practice were recorded
MISC--: practiced hand paths could approximated well relatively long parabolic segments
MISC--: following practice orientations spatial locations fitted parabolic segments could drawn only clusters there was less discrepancy between fitted parabolic segments executed paths
OWNX--: this enabled us show well practiced spontaneous scribbling movements represented sequences small number elementary parabolic primitives
MISC--: movement primitive defined movement entity cannot intentionally stopped before its completion
OWNX--: we found well trained monkey movement was usually decelerated after receiving reward but stopped only after completion sequence composed several parabolic segments
MISC--: piece wise parabolic segments generated applying affine geometric transformations single parabolic template
MISC--: thus complex movements might constructed applying sequences suitable geometric transformations few templates
OWNX--: our findings therefore suggest motor system aims at achieving more parsimonious internal representations through practice parabolas serve geometric primitives non euclidean variables employed internal movement representations
