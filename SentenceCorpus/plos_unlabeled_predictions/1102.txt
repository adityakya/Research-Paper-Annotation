MISC--: nutrition research investigates processes living organism receives utilizes materials necessary maintenance life health citation
OWNX--: traditionally nutritional research investigates processes at level whole organism
OWNX--: thermodynamic viewpoint all living organisms exist state far equilibrium
OWNX--: maintain this state central importance harvest sufficient energy surroundings
MISC--: this energy comes controlled combustion macronutrients carbohydrate fat protein
MISC--: overarching organizing principle expressed dynamic energy budget theory citation considers energy food extracted stored reserves distributed throughout body fuel processes essential life
OWNX--: processes include generation heat maintenance gradients across cell membranes production gametes synthesis structural mass establishment maturity somatic maintenance maturity maintenance
OWNX--: this organization effectively decouples organism s internal energy external world facilitating homeostasis
MISC--: this principle clear relevance nutritional physiology
MISC--: contrast dietary macronutrient energy sources dietary micronutrients notably mineral elements vitamins also play key role overall health organism
MISC--: inadequate amounts some dietary micronutrients been demonstrated cause classic deficiency diseases scurvy beriberi anemia goiter cretinism
OWNX--: third class various essential nutrients exist used both energy harvesting synthesis structural mass well precursors specific bioactive compounds
MISC--: nutrients include essential amino acids essential omega omega fatty acids
MISC--: many health disorders not necessarily caused dietary deficiencies but more generally imbalances between intake utilization nutrients
MISC--: while there general consensus proper nutrition prevent various chronic diseases understanding health effects specific nutritional compounds extraordinarily complicated
CONT--: first delivery nutritional perturbation difficult control over long time periods perturbations often relatively subtle effects over time scales typically investigated
MISC--: second very difficult unravel distinctive bioactivity nutritional compound interest when supplied background diet containing hundreds other bioactive components
OWNX--: third difficult assess bioavailability nutrient interest especially at level specific target organs cells
OWNX--: problem bioavailability at whole body level had long history mathematical modeling specifically trace elements
MISC--: computational kinetic methods were introduced nutritional sciences along use stable isotopes where interpretation kinetic data required development appropriate mathematical models citation citation
OWNX--: typically compartmental modeling approaches used describe absorption distribution elimination nutrient
MISC--: common most models high level aggregation where body adequately described only few compartments
OWNX--: together models aim provide rational basis determination nutritional requirements body understanding differences requirements different micronutrients
CONT--: while traditional modeling methods been very useful real challenge modeling nutrition help understand rationally manipulate complex relationship between nutrition health determined integrated multiscale responses nutrients ranging whole body subcellular levels organization over time scales minutes years
MISC--: this difficulty apparent problems arise current efforts pinpoint precise role nutrition metabolic syndrome
OWNX--: at long time scale whole body level organization prolonged period consuming more energy than expended results gradual development obesity increases one s risk developing insulin resistance hallmark metabolic syndrome

MISC--: thus understanding how nutrition impacts mechanisms underlying insulin resistance requires quantitative analysis description multiscale highly coupled regulatory network includes thousands components ranging over subcellular whole body levels organization spanning time scales seconds years
MISC--: although conceptual perspective outlined above derived literature without too much effort extremely difficult develop integrated quantitative understanding spans entire complexity mechanisms involved
MISC--: principle mathematical models offer this capability therefore required more fully understand physiological basis not only metabolic syndrome but role nutrition health disease general
