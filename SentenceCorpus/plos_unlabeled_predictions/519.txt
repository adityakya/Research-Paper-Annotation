MISC--: patterns spontaneous activity developing retina lgn cortex necessary proper development visual cortex
MISC--: patterns intact primary visual cortices many newborn animals develop properties similar those adult cortex but without training benefit visual experience
MISC--: previous models demonstrated how v responses initialized through mechanisms specific development prior visual experience using axonal guidance cues relying simple pairwise correlations spontaneous activity additional developmental constraints
AIMX--: we argue spontaneous patterns may better understood part innate learning strategy learns similarly activity both before during visual experience
AIMX--: abstraction spontaneous activity models we show how visual system may able bootstrap efficient code its natural environment prior external visual experience we continue same refinement strategy upon natural experience
MISC--: patterns generated through simple local interactions contain same relevant statistical properties retinal waves hypothesized waves lgn v
OWNX--: efficient encoding patterns resembles sparse coding natural images producing neurons localized oriented bandpass structure same code found early visual cortical cells
AIMX--: we address relevance higher order statistical properties spontaneous activity how this relates system may adapt similarly activity prior during natural experience how concepts ultimately relate efficient coding our natural world
MISC--: classic debates nature vs nurture innate vs learned pervasive literature early visual development
MISC--: variety studies shown visual system requires external experience mature
MISC--: other hand many animals able see at birth functioning primary visual cortex even before eye opening
MISC--: might seem straightforward assign properties found at birth innate properties dependent visual experience learned
OWNX--: however strict dichotomy may unnecessarily limit our integrated understanding visual development
OWNX--: particular we wish focus issue form learning occurs before birth patterns activity generated internally
MISC--: well known spontaneous endogenous activity necessary permissive proper development visual system
AIMX--: point this paper discuss statistical aspects this activity may sufficient instructive guide development much same way visual experience refines mature visual system
AIMX--: essentially we propose innate learning approach prepares system later experienced based refinement diplomatic balance between nature nurture

MISC--: adult primary visual cortex been known nearly half century v cells respond strongly bars edges citation later experiments demonstrating simple cells v characteristic filter description much like d gabor function citation citation shown figure
OWNX--: v cell specific elongated subregions visual space where relatively bright dark parts visual image will stimulate cell
OWNX--: note this characterization purely descriptive stimulus response paradigm answering what neuron responds instead why filters appearance
MISC--: according efficient coding hypothesis role early visual system remove statistical redundancy visual code citation citation
OWNX--: this hypothesis one way understand visual system develop analyze visual encoding scheme remove redundancy images natural scenes

OWNX--: one conclude results v developed tuned efficiently encode visual world
AIMX--: this paper we make claim there parsimonious computational reason existence spontaneous patterns functional strategy early visual system employ guide this development both prior throughout experience
OWNX--: addition molecular guidance cues we believe visual code refined training patterns spontaneous activity during development similar manner how juvenile animals refine visual code statistical patterns found natural images
MISC--: many statistical structure models rely pairwise correlations between neighboring units implicit assumption other functional descriptions spontaneous activity citation citation
OWNX--: however many efficient coding models applied natural images sparse coding ica rely statistics beyond pairwise correlations
MISC--: fact often first step correlations removed process known decorrelation whitening process at least part considered function retinal ganglion cells citation
OWNX--: although developmental activity patterns known relevant pairwise correlations we argue receptive field refinement may also rely higher order statistics thus bridging gap between models sparse efficient coding spontaneous activity
OWNX--: we will demonstrate simple patterns activity used training images refining visual code
OWNX--: patterns we use resemble only d imaged spontaneous activity available retinal waves this demonstrated figure specific examples our generated patterns figure d
MISC--: beyond visual resemblance our pattern generation technique also abstracts general properties parameters current retinal wave models
OWNX--: we strongly note however this strictly not retinal wave model but abstraction what we believe essential features relevant endogenous activity
AIMX--: we more concerned this paper statistical nature produced activity than its precise localization including whether activity originates one particular area part larger dynamical system
MISC--: example comparison retinal waves lgn v spontaneous activity more direct influence cortical receptive field formation
MISC--: ferrets lgn remains spontaneously active at beginning v activation while v activity retinal wave production do not significantly overlap time citation
AIMX--: lgn v activity been experimentally characterized citation citation but far less understood than retinal activity thus prompting our analogies retinal waves this paper

AIMX--: main goal this paper show how same adaptive efficient algorithm applied both natural inputs well spontaneous activity
AIMX--: we show certain wavefront containing patterns possess relevant statistics percolation network provides useful abstraction demonstrating this property
OWNX--: patterns independent how they were generated simply used existence proof possible training role spontaneous activity
OWNX--: first we will show our generated patterns qualitatively resemble known patterns spontaneous activity
AIMX--: we will then compare various methods learning v receptive fields showing how both natural images spontaneous activity patterns used produce v like gabor filters
OWNX--: we will also demonstrate how significant variations receptive field properties occur even at threshold scale invariance showing flexibility learning even this simplified model
OWNX--: finally one main points this paper expressed final figure relevant statistics sensory coding go beyond simple correlations
