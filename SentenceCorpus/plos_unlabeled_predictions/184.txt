MISC--: prokaryotes shine dalgarno sequences nucleotides upstream start codons messenger rnas complementary ribosomal rna facilitate initiation protein synthesis
MISC--: location sd sequences relative start codons stability hybridization between mrna rrna correlate rate synthesis
OWNX--: thus accurate characterization sd sequences enhances our understanding how organism s transcriptome relates its cellular proteome
OWNX--: we implemented individual nearest neighbor hydrogen bond model oligo oligo hybridization created new metric relative spacing identify both location hybridization potential sd sequences simulating binding between mrnas single stranded s rrna tails
OWNX--: prokaryote genomes we identified genes out where strongest binding translation initiation region included start codon deviating expected location sd sequence five ten bases upstream
OWNX--: we designated rs genes
OWNX--: additional analysis uncovered unusual bias start codon majority rs genes used gug not aug furthermore rs genes whose sd sequence was associated free energy release less than kcal mol were within nucleotides upstream frame initiation codons
MISC--: most likely explanation unexpected location sd sequence genes mis annotation start codon
OWNX--: this way new rs metric provides improved method gene sequence annotation
OWNX--: remaining strong rs genes appear their sd sequences unexpected location includes start codon
OWNX--: thus our rs metric provides new way explore role rrna mrna nucleotide hybridization translation initiation
MISC--: shine dalgarno citation sequenced end escherichia coli s s ribosomal rna observed part sequence accucc was complementary motif ggaggu located initiation codons several messenger rnas
OWNX--: they combined this observation previously published experimental evidence suggested complementarity between tail s rrna region start codon mrna was sufficient create stable double stranded structure could position ribosome correctly mrna during translation initiation
MISC--: motif mrnas ggaggu variations also complementary parts s rrna tail since been referred shine dalgarno sequence
MISC--: shine dalgarno s theory was bolstered steitz jakes citation eventually experimentally verified hui de boer citation jacob et al citation
OWNX--: since shine dalgarno s publication two different approaches been used identify position sd sequences prokaryotes sequence similarity free energy calculations
MISC--: methods based sequence similarity include searching upstream start codons sub strings sd sequences at least three nucleotides long citation
MISC--: identification errors arise this approach several reasons citation
OWNX--: threshold similarity does not exist clearly delineate actual sd sequences spurious sites significant but low degree similarity sd sequence
MISC--: lack certainty led number observations gene sequences appear partition themselves into two categories those obvious sd sequences those without
MISC--: inability sequence techniques pinpoint exact location sd sequence poses problem because its location believed affect translation initiation citation citation
MISC--: second approach using free energy calculations based thermodynamic considerations proposed mechanism s binding mrna overcomes limitations sequence analysis
MISC--: watson crick hybridization occurs between terminal single stranded nucleotides s rrna sd sequence mrna significant effect translation citation citation
OWNX--: formation hydrogen bonds between aligned complementary nucleotides basis watson crick hybridization results more stable double stranded structure lower free energy than participating single stranded sequences
MISC--: one long standing implementation this model mfold citation quantifies degree hybridization stability rna secondary structure calculating change energy citation citation
BASE--: this method estimating free energy been adapted identify sd sequences repeatedly calculating g values progressive alignments rrna tail mrna region upstream start codon citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: all studies observed trough negative g upstream start codon whose location largely coincident sd consensus sequence
MISC--: this second approach both identify sd sequence pinpoint its exact location having minimal g value
CONT--: however exact location sd sequence dependent nucleotide indexing scheme algorithm i e nucleotide designated position
OWNX--: normalize indexing further extend free energy analysis through start codon into coding region genes we created new metric relative spacing
OWNX--: this metric localizes binding across entire translation initiation region relative rrna tail enabling us characterize binding involves start codon well sequences downstream
MISC--: rs also independent length rrna tail this property allows comparison binding locations between species
BASE--: examining sequences downstream start codons we could explore mrnas lack any upstream region leaderless mrnas citation citation
MISC--: lack any untranslated leader mrnas prompted searches other sequence motifs could interact s rrna
MISC--: one downstream box hypothesis citation been disproved citation
MISC--: thus there continued search explanation highly conserved sequences initiation codon been observed many leaderless mrnas citation citation citation
OWNX--: this study we use rs metric identify positions minimal g troughs genes species prokaryotes test its usefulness means improve existing annotation tools i e identifying sd sequences
OWNX--: we observe genes where strongest binding entire tir takes place one nucleotide downstream start codon at rs
MISC--: genes unusually strong binding
OWNX--: we then determine if genes were mis annotated conclude
