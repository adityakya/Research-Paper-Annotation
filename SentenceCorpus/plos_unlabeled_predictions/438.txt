MISC--: micrornas important post transcriptional regulators but extent this regulation uncertain both regard number mirna genes their targets
OWNX--: using algorithm based intragenomic matching potential mirnas their targets coupled support vector machine classification mirna precursors we explore potential regulation mirnas three plant genomes arabidopsis thaliana populus trichocarpa oryza sativa
OWNX--: we find intragenomic matching conjunction supervised learning approach contains enough information allow reliable computational prediction mirna candidates without requiring conservation across species
OWNX--: using this method we identify mirna candidate genes capable extensive base pairing potential target mrnas thaliana p trichocarpa o sativa respectively
MISC--: this more than five times number currently annotated mirnas plants
MISC--: many candidates derived repeat regions yet they seem contain features necessary correct processing mirna machinery
MISC--: conservation analysis indicates only few candidates conserved between species
OWNX--: we conclude there large potential mirna mediated regulatory interactions encoded genomes investigated plants
AIMX--: we hypothesize some interactions may realized under special environmental conditions while others readily recruited when organisms diverge adapt new niches
MISC--: small rnas now accepted major players control eukaryotic gene expression
MISC--: most well known micrornas small interfering rnas both derived processing dsrna molecules members drosha dicer family endonucleases
MISC--: plants sirna mirna distinguished mainly their biogenesis not their mechanism action
OWNX--: mirnas arise stem loop precursors encoded genome their major mechanism action plants thought post transcriptional regulation through near complementary base pairing target mrnas leading specific endonucleolytic cleavage degradation target citation
MISC--: most initially discovered mirnas were so highly conserved evolution defining characteristic mirna was had conserved citation
MISC--: this attribute those mirnas discovered early been used successfully number groups computationally predict new mirna genes citation citation
MISC--: basically methods scan genome inverted repeats potential form mirna precursors
MISC--: scans typically find order hundreds thousands millions hairpins depending genome size search parameters citation
OWNX--: this high number then reduced only keeping hairpins conserved other species
MISC--: another approach search only transcribed sequences form expressed sequence tags citation citation
OWNX--: this method works nonsequenced genomes efficiently reduces search space probably leading lower number false positives but method also misses candidates not covered expressed sequence tag libraries
MISC--: mirbase version arabidopsis thaliana mirna genes listed most conserved down monocot oryza sativa
MISC--: however studies noncoding rna shown lack conservation does not necessarily mean lack function citation
MISC--: potentially all takes evolve mirna one many inverted repeats genome transcribed necessary structure sequence features recognized processed drosha dicer
MISC--: indeed large numbers more narrowly conserved mirnas also exist citation
MISC--: recent bioinformatic study human identified patterns associated mirna precursors suggested number mirna precursors larger than citation
MISC--: plants similar situation could exist
MISC--: deep sequencing effort arabidopsis using massively parallel signature sequence technique revealed distinct small rna species citation mapping large variety genomic contexts including exons introns repetitive dna intergenic regions
MISC--: this perhaps not surprising considering other studies finding unexpectedly large fractions eukaryotic genomes transcribed also outside antisense annotated protein coding genes citation citation
OWNX--: necessary feature any functional mirna must target at least one mrna
MISC--: plants this means mirna must almost complementary some part spliced mrna transcript
MISC--: set rules allowing mismatches only certain positions been suggested based experimental observations citation
OWNX--: requirement target previously been used predict plant mirnas citation citation instead relying phylogenetic conservation methods successfully used intragenomic matches potential target mrnas find hairpins potentially capable producing mirnas regulate target
OWNX--: intragenomic matches will inherently arise structure dynamics genome retrotransposons formation pseudogenes other duplicative events provide sequences almost ready regulate originally copied gene citation likewise reverse strand one gene complementary other paralogous genes
MISC--: not relying conservation between species intragenomic matching capable more fully charting potential post transcriptional regulation mirnas
MISC--: effort reduce spurious predictions earlier screens new mirnas removed candidates overlapping existing annotation repeats protein coding regions
MISC--: although filters probably increase signal noise ratio they also introduce biases assuming repeat derived sequences not functional each sequence segment only one function
MISC--: however transposon derived conventional mirnas been demonstrated arabidopsis citation recent work several groups show repeat associated mirnas quite common mammals citation citation
MISC--: borchert et al point human mirnas associated alu repeats polymerase iii transcription citation
MISC--: piriyapongsa et al link experimentally characterized human mirnas different types transposable elements citation
MISC--: conserved other vertebrate genomes authors predict additional novel transposable element derived mirnas
OWNX--: observations along evidence very complex widespread transcriptional patterns eukaryotes including nested transcripts antisense transcription citation underlines importance enumerating all possible mirna target interactions order explore full potential mirna mediated regulation
OWNX--: this paper we develop apply mimatcher pipeline perform intragenomic matching followed classification mirna candidates using support vector machines
OWNX--: using this method three plant genomes thaliana o sativa p trichocarpa we find species specific mirna like hairpins almost perfect complementarity mrna targets
OWNX--: we present indications many active hypothesize remainder forms pool regulators easily recruited natural selection adapting organisms
