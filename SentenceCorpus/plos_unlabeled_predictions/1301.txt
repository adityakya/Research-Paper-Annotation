MISC--: yeast successfully adapts environmental stress altering physiology fine tuning metabolism
OWNX--: this fine tuning achieved through regulation both gene expression protein activity shaped various physiological requirements
MISC--: requirements impose sustained evolutionary pressure ultimately selects specific gene expression profile generating suitable adaptive response each environmental change
MISC--: although some requirements stress specific likely others common various situations
OWNX--: we hypothesize evolutionary pressure minimizing biosynthetic costs might left signatures physicochemical properties proteins whose gene expression fine tuned during adaptive responses
AIMX--: test this hypothesis we analyze existing yeast transcriptomic data responses investigate how several properties proteins correlate changes gene expression
OWNX--: our results reveal signatures consistent selective pressure economy protein synthesis during adaptive response yeast various types stress
MISC--: signatures differentiate two groups adaptive responses respect how cells manage expenditure protein biosynthesis
OWNX--: one group significant trends towards downregulation large proteins upregulation small ones observed
OWNX--: other group we find no trends
OWNX--: results consistent resource limitation being important evolution first group stress responses
MISC--: unicellular organisms sensitive environmental challenges
OWNX--: their internal milieu acts buffer against changes mounting adaptive response involving modifications at different cellular levels
MISC--: appropriate adaptive responses require intracellular signaling changes conformation activity proteins changes transcription translation genes etc citation
CONT--: many cellular modifications characterize any adaptive response due need acquiring new protein functionalities while shutting down other protein functionalities not required new conditions
MISC--: changes ultimately fine tune mechanisms processes allow cell function appropriately survive under changing environments
OWNX--: fine tuning shaped various functional requirements physiological constraints
OWNX--: functional requirements result specific demands imposed cell survival environment
MISC--: other hand physiological constraints defined limits within cell physically capable changing activity its component parts meet functional requirements
MISC--: global point view adaptive responses seen multi optimization problem because cells evolved appropriate responses cope different types stress while optimizing different parts its metabolism each those responses citation citation
MISC--: example cells simultaneously increase concentration specific metabolites proteins while decreasing concentration other components prevent increase concentration unneeded metabolites
OWNX--: increase could strain cell solubility capacity increase spurious reactivity dangerous levels
OWNX--: other functional constraints likely provide sustained evolutionary pressures ultimately select specific gene expression profile leads suitable adaptive responses
OWNX--: arguments mind thus important identify functional requirements quantitative physiological constraints may significantly shape adaptive responses
MISC--: among others minimization energetic expenditure plays important role cells growing exponentially rich medium
MISC--: several signatures consistent minimization metabolic cost already been identified properties set proteins expressed when cells growing rich media
OWNX--: example genes coding proteins highly abundant under basal conditions pattern synonymous codon usage well adapted relative abundance synonymous trnas yeast s cerevisiae escherichia coli citation citation
MISC--: another signature found genes highly expressed under basal conditions sequence bias minimizes transcriptional translational costs citation
OWNX--: this minimization metabolic cost further observed relative amino acid composition abundant proteins under same conditions
MISC--: proteins enriched metabolically cheaper amino acids citation
MISC--: final example general signature codon bias long genes
MISC--: this bias probability missense errors reduced during translation citation citation citation
MISC--: biases suggest reducing overall costs metabolism whenever possible may significantly increase cellular fitness
MISC--: this view consistent observation small changes gene expression affecting levels protein synthesis influence fitness specific e coli strains citation
MISC--: this body results strongly supports notion metabolic cost acts selective pressure shaping properties cells growing rich medium absence environmental stresses
OWNX--: thus one might ask if minimization metabolic cost also important factor evolution adaptive responses stress conditions
CONT--: predictable this evolutionary pressure might leave stronger signatures adaptive responses require use higher atp amounts cell adaptation heat weak organic acids nacl
MISC--: three cases been reported atp concentrations decrease due high energy demand citation
MISC--: given protein synthesis one costliest biosynthetic efforts cell citation minimization metabolic cost might biased properties proteins whose expression change during adaptation
OWNX--: therefore here we ask following questions
MISC--: there signature consistent selective pressure minimizing metabolic cost proteins synthesis during adaptive responses stress
MISC--: one find general signatures physicochemical properties proteins expression patterns genes involved adaptive response different environmental challenges
MISC--: if so what physiological constraints consistent those signatures
AIMX--: we address questions investigating how value several properties proteins related changes gene expression levels during various environmental changes
OWNX--: we find genes whose expression upregulated during different types adaptive responses tend code proteins small while genes whose expression downregulated during same responses tend code proteins large
OWNX--: this signature consistent selective pressure minimizing metabolic cost proteins synthesis
MISC--: more significant adaptive responses where changes gene expression levels affect large fraction genome
OWNX--: our knowledge this first general global signature been identified properties proteins involved adaptive responses stress
