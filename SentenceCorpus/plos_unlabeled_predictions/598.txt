MISC--: protein identification using mass spectrometry indispensable computational tool life sciences
MISC--: dramatic increase use proteomic strategies understand biology living systems generates ongoing need more effective efficient accurate computational methods protein identification
MISC--: wide range computational methods each various implementations available complement different proteomic approaches
MISC--: solid knowledge range algorithms available more critically accuracy effectiveness techniques essential ensure many proteins possible within any particular experiment correctly identified
MISC--: here we undertake systematic review currently available methods algorithms interpreting managing analyzing biological data associated protein identification
MISC--: we summarize advances computational solutions they responded corresponding advances mass spectrometry hardware
MISC--: evolution scoring algorithms metrics automated protein identification also discussed focus relative performance different techniques
OWNX--: we also consider relative advantages limitations different techniques particular biological contexts
AIMX--: finally we present our perspective future developments area computational protein identification considering most recent literature new promising approaches problem well identifying areas yet explored potential application methods other areas computational biology
MISC--: proteomics relatively new but rapidly maturing discipline within life science research understanding biology organism via large scale study proteins expressed organism
MISC--: there already vast body literature applying proteomics many different areas clinical biochemical interest study pathogenesis development prevention treatment wide range diseases citation
MISC--: protein identification key essential step field proteomics
MISC--: examination patterns protein expression alone course lead important discoveries including example classification samples basis particular pattern
MISC--: however without identifying proteins known critically involved system under investigation not possible delve into biological explanation patterns develop hypotheses underlying biology system interest
MISC--: thus while protein identification may often overlooked taken granted remains key initial step elucidating biology organism studying its protein expression
OWNX--: our ability maximize benefit proteomics life science research often dependent our ability accurately quickly completely identify full complement proteins found our samples interest
MISC--: exponential growth dna sequence protein databases coupled similar growth machine throughput critical nature protein identification proteomics process seen explosion interest protein identification
MISC--: example both number proportion national center biotechnology articles containing phrase protein identification seen exponential growth past decade
MISC--: mass spectrometry emerged primary tool protein identification cornerstone proteomics
CONT--: while was first used almost century ago citation use mass spectrometry biological applications dates s citation its use peptide identification dates s citation
MISC--: accuracy speed sample weight range seen improvements spanning many orders magnitude recent decades citation making mass spectrometry one greatest scientific success stories twentieth century
MISC--: no fewer than five nobel laureates been awarded distinction their pioneering work mass spectrometry
MISC--: speed accuracy machines make them amenable high throughput applications required not just proteomics but also many other areas life sciences resulting rapid developments hardware software data management last decade
MISC--: when we consider use mass spectrometers protein identification rapid developments lead bewildering number instrument configurations analysis algorithms data formats
MISC--: mass spectrometry often critically important number research pipelines
MISC--: biologists computational biologists especially often expected meaningfully manage interpret mass spectrometry data requiring understanding most up date methods available maximize true protein identifications minimize false identifications their particular application
MISC--: this insight into protein identification algorithms important because often results may ambiguous biases chosen make problem computationally tractable radically affect result
MISC--: despite improvements mass spectrometry hardware reliability modern protein identification software several studies involving range mass spectrometers datasets identification algorithms shown each case fewer than half proteins complex proteomic sample identified citation citation
MISC--: given critical role protein identification proteomic analysis this review aims explore this apparent upper limit effectiveness current protein identification algorithms give relevant background information practical suggestions computational biologists life scientists so best possible protein identifications realized
