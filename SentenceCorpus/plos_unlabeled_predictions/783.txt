MISC--: short read sequencing been applied successfully resequence human genome those other species but not whole genome sequencing novel organisms
OWNX--: here we describe sequencing assembly novel clinical isolate pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pab using very short read technology
OWNX--: reads each nucleotides length we assembled genome into one scaffold ordered contiguous sequences containing nucleotides including one contig spanning nucleotides plus additional unordered contigs containing nucleotides
OWNX--: our method includes novel gene boosting algorithm uses amino acid sequences predicted proteins build better assembly
MISC--: this study demonstrates feasibility very short read sequencing sequencing bacterial genomes particularly those related species been sequenced previously expands potential application this new technology most known prokaryotic species
MISC--: genome sequencing technology moved into new era introduction extremely fast sequencing technologies produce over one billion base pairs dna single run
MISC--: some fastest methods today based strategies cyclic reversible termination citation ligation based sequencing citation produce shortest read lengths ranging bp
MISC--: lengths sufficient resequencing projects including efforts sample human population but they yet prove useful sequencing novel species
MISC--: difficulty no existing assembly algorithms accurately reconstruct genome short reads citation
MISC--: first published report bacterial genome sequence short reads used pyrosequencing technology was able generate reads averaging bp
MISC--: study citation demonstrated feasibility assembling small bacterial genome mycoplasma genitalium reads covered genome fold
MISC--: this combination coverage read length allowed margulies et al generate contiguous stretchs dna averaging kilobases
MISC--: results using pyrosequencing improved steadily read lengths increased bp longer but difficulty de novo assembly raised questions about utility alternative sequencing technologies those produce reads shorter than bp genome sequencing projects
MISC--: assembly novel strains species where genome not previously been sequenced very short reads proven more difficult although simulation studies indicated should possible citation
OWNX--: recent study showed combination pyrosequencing reads paired end sequencing could used assemble million base pair genome into just contigs linked together scaffolds citation
MISC--: another recent effort used hybrid strategy mixed pyrosequencing traditional sanger sequencing produce draft assemblies marine microbes citation
MISC--: contrast very short reads generated solexa sequence analyzer thus far been useful primarily polymorphism discovery human genome resequencing polymorphism discovery caernohabditis elegans citation other applications chip seq citation identifies genomic regions bound transcription factors
MISC--: very short reads currently bp produced crt technologies solexa present far more difficult assembly problem
MISC--: standard assembly algorithms arachne citation citation celera assembler citation cannot process short reads at all spurring development several new algorithms designed short reads including ssake citation velvet citation edena citation allpaths citation
MISC--: latter methods handle solexa data but they produce highly fragmented assemblies when provided whole genome data bacterial genome
MISC--: inherent problem very short reads every repetitive sequence longer than read length causes breaks assembly
OWNX--: demonstrate feasibility assembling bacterial genome bp reads using related genomes assist process we chose pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pab highly virulent strain isolated frostbite patient
MISC--: p aeruginosa ubiquitous environmental bacteria clinical importance leading cause gram negative nosocomial infections citation citation
MISC--: several p aeruginosa genomes been sequenced previously including two laboratory strains pao originally isolated wound pa isolated burn citation citation
MISC--: pa pao percent identical across mbp shared both genomes their similarity pab allowed us improve assembly provided means check its accuracy
OWNX--: one our goals sequencing pab was identify genomic differences contribute its altered pathogenicity
MISC--: here we report assembly p aeruginosa pab entirely bp reads using novel assembly strategy takes advantage related genomes homologous protein sequences
MISC--: assembly very high quality comparable better than draft assemblies produced using earlier sequencing technologies
CONT--: this study shows novel bacterial genome sequenced entirely very short read technology without use paired end sequences assembled into high quality genome
MISC--: even at fold coverage amount sequence represents just one quarter single sequencing run solexa instrument brings sequencing cost easily within reach most scientists
OWNX--: making all our assembly software free open source we hope further bring down barriers desktop whole genome sequencing
OWNX--: we generated random shotgun reads p aeruginosa pab using solexa technology
OWNX--: all reads were exactly bp length
OWNX--: we used four distinct computational steps assemble genome pab
OWNX--: initial step we used comparative assembly algorithm amoscmp citation aligns all reads reference genome then builds contigs based alignments
CONT--: algorithm gains efficiency avoiding costly all versus all overlapping step particularly difficult very short reads due high incidence false overlaps citation
MISC--: we modified amoscmp tuning mummer software citation run within amoscmp look exact matches reference genome at least bp allowing at most two mismatches each read
OWNX--: we found careful trimming reads based their matches reference produced better assemblies than un trimmed reads
OWNX--: initial assembly used reads leaving singletons
OWNX--: pab genome closer pa than pao we therefore used pa primary reference orienting contigs
OWNX--: our second step was novel enhancement comparative assembly strategy we used multiple reference genomes
OWNX--: we used complete genomes both pao citation pa citation separately build multiple comparative assemblies found pa produced better assembly comprising contigs containing bp
MISC--: bulk sequence was contained contigs longer than kbp collectively covered bp
MISC--: there were bp pa genome were not covered initial assembly due divergence between two strains
MISC--: however gaps comparative assembly based pao occurred different locations due differences between strains
MISC--: best assembly based pao comprised contigs covering bp
OWNX--: we aligned two assemblies one another identify locations where contig pao based assembly might span two more contigs pa based assembly
OWNX--: each case we filled gap sequence pao assembly using minimus assembler citation stitch together contigs
OWNX--: this algorithm closed gaps reducing number contigs all but were bp
MISC--: bulk genome bp was contained just contigs bp longer
OWNX--: note overlapping contigs between two assemblies did not agree perfectly
OWNX--: order produce clean merged assembly we re mapped reads contigs using amoscmp create consistent multi alignments
OWNX--: third step used novel algorithm gene boosted assembly
BASE--: this step we took contigs previous step identified protein coding genes using our annotation pipeline based glimmer citation blast citation
BASE--: because amino acid sequences much more conserved than nucleotide sequences we were able use predicted protein sequences fill gaps even where dna sequences diverged
OWNX--: annotation pipeline identified proteins longest contigs
OWNX--: initial annotation we identified those genes extended beyond ends contigs spanned gaps between contigs
OWNX--: we extracted amino acid sequences corresponding gap positions small buffer sequence included each side each gap
OWNX--: next we used tblastn citation align each protein sequence all unused reads translated all frames
OWNX--: this step identified each gap small set reads would fill missing protein sequence tblastn results provided initial locations multiple alignment
OWNX--: we then used new program abba assemble reads together flanking contigs close gaps
MISC--: this gene boosted assembly protocol extended many contigs closed gaps ranging length bp reducing number long contigs
AIMX--: separate test we conducted gene boosted assembly pab using only annotated proteins pa without any reference genomic sequence
OWNX--: this experiment we aligned all translated reads each protein used abba assemble each one
MISC--: proteins abba produced single contig covered entire reference protein another proteins assembled into few contigs
OWNX--: thus out pab proteins assembled using pure gene boosting approach additional proteins would likely assembled if we used large set proteins boosting
MISC--: this demonstrates absence closely related genome sequence gene boosted assembly use protein sequences diverge much more slowly than genomic dna assemble most genes new bacterial strain although results will lack global genome structure information
OWNX--: fourth step our method identified any remaining dna sequences were unique pab outside predicted gene regions
OWNX--: we separately constructed pure de novo assemblies million solexa reads using ssake edena velvet
MISC--: velvet assembly was best three creating contigs longest being bp
OWNX--: we used mummer align contigs long contigs our scaffold previous step identified cases where de novo contigs spanned gaps extended contigs
OWNX--: this step allowed us close gaps reducing number contigs our main scaffold
OWNX--: after removing velvet contigs were already contained our scaffold we had unplaced de novo contigs spanning bp
MISC--: longest unplaced contig was bp
