MISC--: fundamental properties phasic firing neurons usually characterized noise free condition
MISC--: absence noise phasic neurons exhibit class excitability lack repetitive firing steady current injections
OWNX--: time varying inputs phasic neurons band pass filters slope detectors because they do not respond inputs containing exclusively low frequencies shallow slopes
OWNX--: however we show noisy conditions response properties phasic neuron models distinctly altered
MISC--: noise enables phasic model encode low frequency inputs outside response range associated deterministic model
MISC--: interestingly this seemingly stochastic resonance like effect differs significantly classical sr behavior spiking systems both signal noise ratio temporal response pattern
MISC--: instead being most sensitive peak subthreshold signal typical classical sr system phasic models most sensitive signal s rising falling phases where slopes steep
MISC--: this finding consistent fact there not absolute input threshold terms amplitude rather response threshold more properly defined stimulus slope frequency
OWNX--: we call encoding low frequency signals noise phasic models slope based sr because noise lower diminish slope threshold ramp stimuli

MISC--: although this behavior seems consistent sr fundamentally different sr reasons listed below
MISC--: classical sr system adding small amount noise subthreshold signal facilitates threshold crossing spike emission upon crossing membrane voltage threshold
MISC--: when intensity noise properly chosen signal encoded eliciting more spikes around signal s peak fewer spikes around its trough
MISC--: larger amplitude subthreshold signal better noise gated encoding becomes whereas supra threshold signals noise will only degrade signal encoding
OWNX--: this sense we call classical sr system amplitude based stochastic resonance
