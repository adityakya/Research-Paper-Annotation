MISC--: claim genetic properties neurons significantly influence their synaptic network structure common notion neuroscience
MISC--: nematode caenorhabditis elegans provides exciting opportunity approach this question large scale quantitative manner
OWNX--: its synaptic connectivity network been identified combined cellular studies we currently characteristic connectivity gene expression signatures most its neurons
OWNX--: using two complementary analysis assays we show expression signature neuron carries significant information about its synaptic connectivity signature identify list putative genes predicting neural connectivity
AIMX--: current study rigorously quantifies relation between gene expression synaptic connectivity signatures c elegans nervous system identifies subsets neurons where this relation highly marked
MISC--: results presented genes identified provide promising starting point further more detailed computational experimental investigations
MISC--: accepted common notion genes play major role formation nervous system they specify neuronal cell types help destine neurons into defined neural circuits provide important cues determining their communication citation citation
OWNX--: many studies identified specific genes nematode c elegans disrupt development neural circuits
MISC--: genes typically responsible neuronal morphology axon development synaptogenesis
MISC--: findings include e g axon guidance genes citation attractive repulsive interactions citation citation presynaptic input modulation citation presynaptic differentiation citation synaptic specificity genes citation
MISC--: findings been based specifically targeted studies each designed address specific pathway neuron type receptor transmitter
CONT--: yet been difficult identify large scale mutations determine specific identity synaptic connections mainly because synaptic specification one last steps complex process neuronal differentiation axonal migration citation
MISC--: sieburth et al citation presented first large scale screening genes involved c elegans neuromuscular junction
OWNX--: study identified more than novel genes specific functions transmission signals across this junction
OWNX--: while latter study was not aimed at identifying synaptic connectivity genes demonstrated plausibility addressing questions large scale manner
MISC--: recent related study varadan et al citation applied entropy minimization approach c elegans data identify sets synergistically interacting genes whose joint expression common most synapses predicts neural connectivity leaving aside specific identity pre post neurons
AIMX--: our study differs theirs both its goals its methods
OWNX--: leads first quantitative characterization relation between genetic properties neurons their synaptic connectivity concomitantly addressing majority c elegans neurons at large
OWNX--: existing c elegans neural wiring diagram provides connectivity signature each neuron specifying other neurons connected
MISC--: each neuron also expression signature extracted wormbase specifying genes directly associated
MISC--: combined together this data enables investigation relation between expression connectivity signatures across most c elegans neurons
AIMX--: we specifically address two attributes this relation first asks whether possible predict neuron s connectivity signature based solely its expression signature
MISC--: second question what extent do neurons similar expression signatures similar connectivity signatures
OWNX--: we show expression signatures neurons carry significant information about their connectivity signatures further identify specific genes play major role determining this relation
OWNX--: gene sets we identify do not necessarily direct causal influence synaptic connectivity specificity however they provide putative gene targets further experimental investigation
OWNX--: finally we suggest methodological way study relations between neurons expression connectivity signatures their actual functional contribution behavior
MISC--: quantifying relations allows addressing classical question neuroscience what dominates functionality neural circuit local genetic basis individual neurons overall network structure determined their connectivity
