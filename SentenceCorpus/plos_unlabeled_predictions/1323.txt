MISC--: human disease heterogeneous similar disease phenotypes resulting distinct combinations genetic environmental factors
OWNX--: small molecule profiling address disease heterogeneity evaluating underlying biologic state individuals through non invasive interrogation plasma metabolite levels
OWNX--: we analyzed metabolite profiles oral glucose tolerance test individuals normal impaired glucose tolerance
OWNX--: our focus was elucidate underlying biologic processes
BASE--: although we initially found little overlap between changed metabolites preconceived definitions metabolic pathways use unbiased network approaches identified significant concerted changes
MISC--: specifically we derived metabolic network edges drawn between reactant product nodes individual reactions between all substrates individual enzymes transporters
OWNX--: we searched active modules regions metabolic network enriched changes metabolite levels
MISC--: active modules identified relationships among changed metabolites highlighted importance specific solute carriers metabolite profiles
MISC--: furthermore hierarchical clustering principal component analysis demonstrated changed metabolites ogtt naturally grouped according activities system l amino acid transporters osmolyte carrier slc mitochondrial aspartate glutamate transporter slc
MISC--: comparison between ngt igt groups supported blunted glucose insulin stimulated activities igt group
MISC--: using unbiased pathway models we offer evidence supporting important role solute carriers physiologic response glucose challenge conclude carrier activities reflected individual metabolite profiles perturbation experiments
MISC--: given involvement transporters human disease metabolite profiling may contribute improved disease classification via interrogation specific transporter activities
MISC--: disease heterogeneity challenged practice medicine
MISC--: individuals same apparent disease at our current diagnostic resolution often show remarkable variation prognosis treatment responsiveness presumably because superficially similar disease state arise diverse combinations genetic environmental factors citation

MISC--: we hypothesize characterization human disease metabolomic profiling should similarly benefit interpreting metabolite changes context known metabolic reactions
OWNX--: we use data derived oral glucose tolerance tests individuals normal impaired glucose tolerance citation
OWNX--: we first sought significant overlaps between observed metabolite changes preconceived definitions metabolic pathways
MISC--: next we applied unbiased pathway analysis mapping metabolite changes recent reconstruction human metabolic network citation use recently developed variant citation previous approaches citation derived mrna expression analysis find active metabolic modules connected subnetworks highly changed metabolites
MISC--: while biased approach yielded little resulting unbiased pathway models highlight interconnectedness between changed metabolites propose role solute carriers ogtt metabolite profiles
MISC--: hierarchical clustering principal component analysis confirmed importance specific transporters demonstrating metabolites cluster naturally according activities system l amino acid slc osmolyte transporters
MISC--: furthermore they suggest important role slc mitochondrial aspartate glutamate transporter interindividual metabolite profile variability
