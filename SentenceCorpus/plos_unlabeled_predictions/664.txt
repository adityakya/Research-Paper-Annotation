MISC--: most mammalian genes able express several splice variants phenomenon known alternative splicing
MISC--: serious alterations alternative splicing occur cancer tissues leading expression multiple aberrant splice forms
MISC--: most studies alternative splicing defects focused identification cancer specific splice variants potential therapeutic targets
OWNX--: here we examine instead bulk non specific transcript isoforms analyze their level disorder using measure uncertainty called shannon s entropy
OWNX--: we compare isoform expression entropy normal cancer tissues same anatomical site different classes transcript variations alternative splicing polyadenylation transcription initiation
MISC--: whereas alternative initiation polyadenylation show no significant gain loss entropy between normal cancer tissues alternative splicing shows highly significant entropy gains cancers studied
OWNX--: this entropy gain characterized flattening expression profile normal isoforms correlated level estimated cellular proliferation cancer tissue
MISC--: interestingly genes present highest entropy gain enriched splicing factors
OWNX--: we provide here first quantitative estimate splicing disruption cancer
MISC--: expression normal splice variants widely significantly disrupted at least half cancers studied
AIMX--: we postulate splicing disorders may develop part splicing alteration key splice factors turn significantly impact multiple target genes
MISC--: majority mammalian genes produce alternative transcripts part their normal expression program citation citation
MISC--: alternative transcripts include splicing polyadenylation transcription initiation variants expressed differentially different tissues citation citation providing fine tuning gene expression required cell differentiation tissue specific functions
MISC--: disruptions balance alternative transcripts especially at splicing level known affect angiogenesis citation cell differentiation citation invasion citation
MISC--: large body evidence established connections between alternative splicing defects cancer so identification transcript isoforms now considered important avenue cancer diagnosis therapy citation citation
MISC--: disruption splicing isoform expression cancer may result very different underlying genetic events
MISC--: one hand mutations cis regulatory sequences lead abnormal expression specific isoforms observed example brca gene breast ovarian cancer citation
MISC--: another class event includes alterations mrna processing machinery its signalling pathway
MISC--: may affect splicing specific genes cd citation citation but may also cause wider perturbations isoform expression processing multiple genes simultaneously affected citation citation
MISC--: evidence wider changes alternative transcription linked cancer present instance est databases where large fraction splice variant actually tumor specific citation
MISC--: however while most studies splicing cancer attempt isolate signature splice variants significant over expression disease cells no published work date focused bulk splicing disruption potentially arises when splicing machinery impaired
OWNX--: aim present study evaluate extent modalities non specific alternative transcript disruptions cancer
OWNX--: instead seeking interesting signature isoforms we analyzed distribution all isoforms single gene given tissue
OWNX--: we postulated tissue where splicing machinery impaired distribution isoforms may more disordered than control tissue
OWNX--: measure level disorder cdna cdna tag libraries we borrowed notion entropy information theory
OWNX--: we applied this measure all three types alternative transcription comparing isoform distributions pairs disease normal tissues
OWNX--: our results show neither alternative polyadenylation nor alternative transcription initiation associated disordered isoform expression
MISC--: however half cancers studied alternative splicing showed highly significant entropy gain relative corresponding normal tissues
OWNX--: we analyze this entropy gain discuss its possible causes
