OWNX--: accurate modelling biological systems requires deeper more complete knowledge about molecular components their functional associations than we currently
MISC--: traditionally new knowledge protein associations generated experiments played central role systems modelling contrast generally less trusted bio computational predictions
MISC--: however we will not achieve realistic modelling complex molecular systems if current experimental designs lead biased screenings real protein networks leave large functionally important areas poorly characterised
MISC--: assess likelihood this we built comprehensive network models yeast human proteomes using meta statistical integration diverse computationally predicted protein association datasets
OWNX--: we compared predicted networks against combined experimental datasets seven biological resources at different level statistical significance
OWNX--: eukaryotic predicted networks resemble all topological noise features experimentally inferred networks both species we also show this observation not due random behaviour
MISC--: addition topology predicted networks contains information true protein associations beyond constitutive first order binary predictions
OWNX--: we also observe most reliable predicted protein associations experimentally uncharacterised our models constituting hidden dark matter networks analogy astronomical systems
MISC--: some this dark matter shows enrichment particular functions contains key functional elements protein networks hubs associated important functional areas like regulation ras protein signal transduction human cells
MISC--: thus characterising this large functionally important dark matter elusive established experimental designs may crucial modelling biological systems
OWNX--: any case predictions provide valuable guide experimentally elusive regions
MISC--: many features biological systems cannot inferred simple sum their components but rather emerge network properties citation
MISC--: organisms comprise systems highly integrated networks accelerating networks citation all components integrated coordinated time space
MISC--: given complexity gaps our current knowledge prevent us modelling complete living organisms citation citation
MISC--: therefore development bio computational approaches identifying new protein functions protein protein functional associations play important role systems biology citation
MISC--: scarce knowledge biological systems further compounded experimental error
MISC--: common different high throughput experimental approaches applied same biological system yield different outcomes resulting protein networks different topological biological properties citation
CONT--: however errors not restricted high throughput analysis
MISC--: example been demonstrated high throughput yeast two hybrid interactions human proteins more precise than literature curated interactions supported single publication citation
MISC--: there been great deal work analysing biological networks across different species giving insights into how networks evolve
MISC--: however many publications yielded disparate sometimes contradictory conclusions
MISC--: observation poor overlap protein networks across species citation divergence amongst organisms citation suggest fast evolution
MISC--: significant variation subunit compositions functional modules also been observed protein networks across species citation
MISC--: however contrast observations recent work using combined protein protein interaction data suggests high conservation protein networks between yeast human citation
MISC--: this approach based data combination stresses importance integrating different data sources reduce bias associated errors functional prediction increase coverage network modelling been demonstrated numerous studies citation citation
OWNX--: increasing accuracy networks integrating different protein interaction data relies intuitive principle combining multiple independent sources evidence gives greater confidence than single source
MISC--: any genome wide computational analyses we expect prediction errors randomly distributed amongst large sample true negative interactions
MISC--: hence unlikely two independent prediction methods will both identify same false positive data large interactomes like yeast human
OWNX--: general we expect precision increase proportionally number independent approaches supporting same evidence
OWNX--: available list well known integration methods specifically designed integrate diverse protein protein interaction ppi datasets we chose fisher method citation order predictor independent experimental data used validate
OWNX--: fisher integration method not trained supervised method example naive bayes svm methods
MISC--: fisher method presumes gaussian random distribution prediction datasets scores null hypothesis fisher integrated score calculation based information theory statistics citation citation
OWNX--: therefore fisher integration score completely independent experimental datasets used this study validate compare predictions
BASE--: this work we significantly increase prediction power binary protein functional associations yeast human proteomes integrating different individual prediction methods using fisher integration method

OWNX--: four different prediction datasets obtained methods were integrated using simple integration fisher s method examples untrained methods
OWNX--: similarly ab initio prediction datasets string citation were also integrated using fisher integration compared against integrated prediction datasets our methods
OWNX--: results fisher integration our prediction datasets were benchmarked compared against individual prediction methods results integrated string methods
OWNX--: all cases we demonstrate increased performance integrated approach fisher integration geco hippi codacath codapfam datasets yielding best results
MISC--: protein pairs identified significant fisher integration p values were used build protein network model yeast human proteomes referred predictogram

OWNX--: implemented other pioneering studies citation we built predicted experimental models further comparison
MISC--: different network topology parameters were calculated compared between kg pg models two test species homo sapiens sacharomyces cerevisae
OWNX--: we observe how networks change cut off confidence score predictions varied
MISC--: results this pg kg network comparison demonstrate pg networks resemble kg networks many major topological features model substantial fraction real protein network associations previously observed some bacterial predicted networks citation citation
MISC--: there been frequent observations low overlaps between different experimental high throughput approaches citation
OWNX--: our comparison pg kg models also show intersection between two models small majority predictions pg novel predictions
MISC--: however overlap between pg kg significantly higher than expected random both species supporting correspondence between pg kg screenings ppi space
MISC--: this pg kg data overlap significantly larger yeast than human pointing better functional characterization yeast ppi network presence larger dark areas human ppi network still hidden current experimental knowledge
AIMX--: we suggest this novel prediction set may valuable estimation relative differences dark matter uncharacterised protein protein associations between both specie we show this dark matter contains key elements hubs important functional roles cell
MISC--: analogy citation dark matter protein network models refers predicted protein protein associations whose existence not yet been experimentally verified
AIMX--: this study we suggest dark matter involves functional associations difficult characterise current experimental assays making any network modelling organisms highly incomplete therefore inaccurate
OWNX--: results divided into four main sections predicted experimental ppi models human yeast compared
