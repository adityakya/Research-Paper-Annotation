MISC--: meta analysis statistical synthesis data aggregating results set comparable studies citation
MISC--: used systematically examine similarities differences between molecular profiling studies carried out populations different species citation
MISC--: gene co expression network relationship between gene pairs usually measured correlation coefficients different forms pearson correlation spearman correlation mutual information
MISC--: therefore problem combining comparing co expression relationships across multiple datasets framed context meta analysis correlation coefficients various methods already been introduced
MISC--: one method fisher s inverse formula test computes combined statistic p values correlation coefficients obtained individual datasets formula
OWNX--: under fairly general conditions this statistic follows formula distribution formula degrees freedom under joint null hypothesis no correlation making possible compute p values combined statistic
MISC--: another widely used meta analysis method involves computing weighted average common metric derived correlation coefficients individual datasets
MISC--: statistic then used test homogeneity over individual measures statistical significance
MISC--: datasets this type meta analysis typically weighted accuracy effect size they provide function individual sample sizes
MISC--: once mean effect size calculated its statistical significance assessed estimating pooled variance mean effect size
MISC--: defining effect size hedges olkin citation rosenthal rubin citation both advocated converting correlation coefficient into standard normal metric using fisher s z transformation then calculating weighted average transformed scores
OWNX--: depending whether effect sizes assumed equal not multiple datasets fixed effect well random effect models employed
MISC--: fixed effect models effect size population fixed but unknown constant therefore assumed same all datasets included meta analysis

OWNX--: one important feature this type method heterogeneity effect sizes estimated provides way assess difference correlation coefficients across multiple datasets
MISC--: schulze citation provided thorough review meta analysis methods their applications
MISC--: meta analysis co expression networks diverse datasets those constructed different species one central issue often unreasonable assume every gene pair unique true effect size across evolutionarily diverse species
MISC--: although random effect models provide more realistic way accommodate cross species variation still assumes parametric distribution population effect sizes
MISC--: circumvent this problem non parametric meta analysis method was introduced identification conserved co expression modules human fly worm yeast citation
OWNX--: this method pearson correlation coefficients expression profiles between every gene pair were computed each organism then rank transformed according their correlations all other genes
MISC--: probabilistic test based order statistics was then applied evaluate probability observing particular configuration ranks across different organisms chance
OWNX--: advantage this method two fold because method based non parametric statistics makes no assumption underlying distribution correlation coefficients across multiple datasets effect size defined gene centric fashion any given gene correlations all other genes considered
