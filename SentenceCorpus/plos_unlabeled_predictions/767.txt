MISC--: metabolic rate heart rate lifespan many other physiological properties vary body mass systematic interrelated ways
OWNX--: present empirical data suggest scaling relationships take form power laws exponents simple multiples one quarter
OWNX--: compelling explanation this observation was put forward decade ago west brown enquist
MISC--: their framework elucidates link between metabolic rate body mass focusing dynamics structure resource distribution networks cardiovascular system case mammals
OWNX--: within this framework wbe model based eight assumptions derives well known observed scaling exponent
AIMX--: this paper we clarify this result only holds limit infinite network size actual exponent predicted model depends sizes organisms being studied
MISC--: failure clarify explore nature this approximation led debates about wbe model were at cross purposes
OWNX--: we compute analytical expressions finite size corrections exponent resulting spectrum scaling exponents function absolute network size
OWNX--: when accounting corrections over size range spanning eight orders magnitude observed mammals wbe model predicts scaling exponent seemingly at odds data
OWNX--: we then proceed study sensitivity scaling exponent respect variations several assumptions underlie wbe model always context finite size corrections
OWNX--: here too trends we derive model seem at odds trends detectable empirical data
CONT--: our work illustrates utility wbe framework reasoning about allometric scaling while at same time suggesting current canonical model may need amendments bring its predictions fully line available datasets
MISC--: whole organism metabolic rate b scales body mass m across species citation formulawhere b normalization constant allometric scaling exponent typically measured very close citation
MISC--: empirical regularity expressed equation known kleiber s law citation citation
MISC--: many other biological rates times scale simple multiples
MISC--: example cellular mass specific metabolic rates heart respiratory rates ontogenetic growth rates scale m whereas blood circulation time development time lifespan scale close m citation citation
MISC--: quarter power scaling also observed ecology evolution citation citation citation
OWNX--: occurrence quarter power scaling at diverse levels biological organization suggests all rates closely linked
MISC--: metabolic rate seems most fundamental because rate at energy materials taken up environment transformed biochemical reactions allocated maintenance growth reproduction
MISC--: series papers starting west brown enquist published model account power scaling metabolic rate body mass across species citation citation citation
MISC--: broad theory biological allometry developed wbe collaborators attributes quarter power scaling near optimal fractal like designs resource distribution networks exchange surfaces
MISC--: there some evidence designs realized at molecular organelle cellular organismal levels wide variety plants animals citation citation
MISC--: intensifying controversy surrounded wbe model since its original publication even extending debate about quality analysis data citation citation
MISC--: one most frequently raised objections wbe model cannot predict scaling exponents metabolic rate deviate citation citation even though potential deviations was appreciated wbe themselves citation
MISC--: if this criticism were true wbe could not principle explain data taxa whose scaling exponents been reported above below citation citation deviations been observed small mammals citation
MISC--: likewise wbe model would unable account scaling maximal metabolic rate body mass appears exponent citation
MISC--: important note actual nature maximal metabolic rate scaling however not without its own controversy see citation argument maximal metabolic rate scales closer when body temperature taken into consideration
MISC--: much work aimed at answering criticisms relied alteration wbe model itself
MISC--: enquist collaborators account different scaling exponents among taxonomic groups emphasizing differences normalization constant b equation deviations wbe assumptions regarding network geometry citation citation citation
MISC--: while results suggestive remains unclear whether not wbe predict exponents significantly different measurable deviations pure power law even absence any variation b networks following exactly geometry required theory
MISC--: although wbe been frequently tested applied citation citation remarkable no theoretical work been published provides more detailed predictions original theory
MISC--: also work aimed at extending wbe relaxing modifying some its assumptions hardly been complete many variations network structure might important far reaching consequences once properly analyzed
OWNX--: this what we set out do present contribution
AIMX--: we show misunderstanding original model led claim wbe only predict exponent
MISC--: this because many predictions tests original model derived leading order approximations
AIMX--: this paper we derive more precise predictions tests
AIMX--: purpose stating our conclusions succinctly we refer wbe framework approach explaining allometric scaling phenomena terms resource distribution networks wbe model instance wbe framework employs particular parameters specifying geometry dynamics networks citation citation
OWNX--: our main findings
MISC--: exponent only holds exactly limit organisms infinite size
MISC--: 
OWNX--: finite sized organisms we show wbe model does not predict pure power law but rather curvilinear relationship between logarithm metabolic rate logarithm body mass
MISC--: although wbe recognized finite size effects would produce deviations pure power scaling small mammals infinite size limit constitutes idealization citation magnitude importance finite size effects were unclear
AIMX--: we show when emulating current practice calculating scaling exponent straight line regressed this curvilinear relationship over entire range body masses exponent predicted wbe model differ significantly without any modifications its assumptions framework
MISC--: 
OWNX--: when realistic parameter values employed construct network we find exponent resulting finite size corrections comes at significantly higher than figure based current data analysis
MISC--: 
OWNX--: our data analysis indeed detects curvilinearity relationship between logarithm metabolic rate logarithm body mass however curvilinearity opposite what we observe wbe model
OWNX--: this implies wbe model needs amendment data analysis needs reassessment
OWNX--: beyond finite size corrections we examine original assumptions wbe two ways
OWNX--: first we vary predicted switch over point above vascular network architecture preserves total cross sectional area vessels at branchings below increases total cross sectional area at branchings
MISC--: two regimes translate into different ratios daughter parent radii at vessel branch points
MISC--: second we allow network branching ratios differ large small vessels
OWNX--: we analyze sensitivity scaling exponent respect each changes context networks finite size
MISC--: this approach similar spirit price et al citation who relaxed network geometry other assumptions wbe context plants
MISC--: supplementary online material text s we also argue data analysis should account log normal distribution body mass abundance thus correcting fact there more small mammals than large ones
MISC--: despite differences structure hydrodynamics vascular systems plants animals citation citation detailed models each yield scaling exponent leading order
AIMX--: present paper we focus wbe model cardiovascular system mammals
OWNX--: all our assumptions derivations calculations should interpreted within context
MISC--: finite size corrections departures basic wbe assumptions important context plants well shown recent studies enquist collaborators citation citation citation
MISC--: final analysis we led seemingly incongruent conclusions many critiques wbe framework misguided exact predictions wbe model not fully supported empirical data
MISC--: former means wbe framework remains once properly understood powerful perspective elucidating allometric scaling principles
MISC--: latter means wbe model must become more respectful biological detail whereupon may yield predictions more closely match empirical data
AIMX--: our work explores how details added model what effects they
AIMX--: paper organized follows
OWNX--: sake self contained presentation we start systematic overview assumptions both explicit implicit underlying wbe theory
OWNX--: text s we provide detailed exposition hydrodynamic derivations model rests upon
MISC--: calculations not original but they not appeared full extent before literature
OWNX--: while nothing section assumptions wbe model novel there seems no single go place wbe literature lays out all components wbe theory
AIMX--: our paper then proceeds brief derivation exact rather than approximate relationship between metabolic rate body mass we then calculate exact predictions scaling exponents networks finite size revisit certain assumptions theory
OWNX--: section comparison empirical data we compare our results trends detectable empirical data
OWNX--: we put forward our conclusions discussion section
