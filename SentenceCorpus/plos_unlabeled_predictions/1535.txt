MISC--: much complexity biochemical networks comes information processing abilities allosteric proteins they receptors ion channels signalling molecules transcription factors
MISC--: allosteric protein uniquely regulated each combination input molecules binds
MISC--: this regulatory complexity causes combinatorial increase number parameters required fit experimental data number protein interactions increases
MISC--: therefore challenges creation updating re use biochemical models
AIMX--: here we propose rule based modelling framework exploits intrinsic modularity protein structure address regulatory complexity
AIMX--: rather than treating proteins black boxes we model their hierarchical structure conformational changes internal dynamics
OWNX--: modelling regulation allosteric proteins through conformational changes we often decrease number parameters required fit data so reduce over fitting improve predictive power model
OWNX--: our method thermodynamically grounded imposes detailed balance also includes molecular cross talk background activity enzymes
AIMX--: we use our allosteric network compiler examine how allostery facilitate macromolecular assembly how competitive ligands change observed cooperativity allosteric protein
OWNX--: we also develop parsimonious model g protein coupled receptors explains functional selectivity predict rank order potency agonists acting through receptor
OWNX--: our methodology should provide basis scalable modular executable modelling biochemical networks systems synthetic biology
MISC--: goal biology understand structure function biochemical networks underpin cellular decision making
MISC--: one organizing principle networks inherently modular citation citation specific functions ascribed subset proteins network
MISC--: yet like logic gates electronic circuits even individual proteins perform sophisticated computations integrate multiple inputs citation citation
MISC--: engineering modular approach analysis system scales well size system its complexity
MISC--: indeed engineers design systems hierarchically modules comprising other modules
MISC--: if molecular biology similarly modular structures atomic modules larger modules constructed
MISC--: signalling networks we may plausibly ascribe this role protein subunits domains citation citation
OWNX--: their function elementary modules often depends allosteric transitions interaction at one site alters structure at distant site via conformational change
MISC--: indeed allostery increases information processing ability network because transforms proteins passive substrates dynamic computational elements citation
MISC--: modular approach analysis design biochemical networks should therefore explicitly describe computations performed individual allosteric proteins
MISC--: efforts tackle complexity biochemical networks should also exploit modularity protein structure
MISC--: protein structure hierarchical given protein often domains also present other proteins repeated subunits
MISC--: example many signalling proteins contain sh pdz domains many receptors ion channels enzymes multimers
MISC--: genetic networks transcription factors also often multimers common dna binding domain zinc finger homeobox
OWNX--: re use protein domains both simplifying confounding feature once domain been characterized characterization used again but also necessary model molecular cross talk between signalling pathways contain proteins similar structures
MISC--: vivo protein interactions generate both combinatorial regulatory complexity
MISC--: combinatorial complexity explosion number possible species system number proteins interactions system increases
MISC--: arises because number states module dramatically increases its proteins bind ligands well each other different residues covalently modified citation citation
MISC--: example p so called cellular gatekeeper known modification sites so potentially states citation
MISC--: thus complete description system potentially requires combinatorially large number chemically distinct species reactions
MISC--: contrast regulatory complexity combinatorial increase number parameters required describe regulatory interactions within system number interactions increase
MISC--: this complexity arises because strength protein interactions depends state module each state module potentially requires unique set parameters characterize interactions within module other modules network molecules external network
MISC--: measuring this number parameters vivo challenging
MISC--: rule based modelling addresses combinatorial complexity allows biologists specify regulatory logic system citation
MISC--: examples include bionetgen citation kappa citation moleculizer citation stochsim citation
MISC--: rather than explicitly enumerating each species reaction network rule based model describes system collection biomolecules interacting according set rules
MISC--: each rule template reaction specifies reactants products all relevant biochemical parameters
MISC--: thus combinatorially complex systems compactly described because large number distinct reactions subsumed template encoded single rule
MISC--: algorithm may automatically infer complete reaction network prior simulation if combinatorial complexity too great use alternative techniques simulate system citation citation
MISC--: importantly some rules also specify contextual conditions constrain when interaction occur hence encode regulatory logic network
MISC--: example rule may allow only doubly phosphorylated map kinase phosphorylate its substrate
MISC--: rule based formalisms describe complex biochemical systems but inherently offer little guidance avoiding number methodological problems
CONT--: first using rules specify regulatory logic system does not address system s regulatory complexity
MISC--: consider g protein coupled receptors allosterically couple extracellular ligand binding site intracellular g protein binding site citation
MISC--: gpcrs promiscuous binding multiple intracellular targets citation citation
MISC--: supposing given gpcr bind one l different drugs endogenous ligands one g different g proteins then principle we require lg pair wise cooperativity parameters describe how each ligand regulates gpcr s affinity each g protein
MISC--: thus number regulatory parameters scales lg number rules also scales lg because each parameter part rule distinct contextual constraints
MISC--: promiscuous allosteric proteins therefore require large number rules parameters characterize their interactions
MISC--: second module should well described function easily re used portable between systems but most rule based formalisms not inherently modular
MISC--: modellers typically treat proteins black boxes define interactions using biochemical equations
OWNX--: interaction centric approaches regulation proteins encoded rules ad hoc conditions no longer apply when proteins interact different partners
MISC--: ad hoc rules obfuscate mechanism underlying allosteric regulation because they do not show explicitly how intrinsic structural thermodynamic properties allosteric proteins generate their functional properties
MISC--: contrast biomolecule centric approach would encode regulatory logic proteins themselves
MISC--: fewer changes rules would then required define how new set interaction partners regulates protein s activity
MISC--: if model includes protein domains subunits re use components would also simplified
MISC--: finally models generated rule based methods should thermodynamically correct
MISC--: biochemical networks there often sets reversible reactions connect into closed loop forming thermodynamic cycle
MISC--: many cycles no free energy consumed example when proteins bind multiple ligands when ligands bind several conformations protein when ion channels bind multiple agonists closed open desensitized states
MISC--: thermodynamics imposes mathematical relationship between equilibrium constants all reactions involved cycles their product must unity
MISC--: equilibrium constants cannot therefore assigned independently
MISC--: thermodynamically correct methodology should ensure model satisfies this constraint ideally construction
AIMX--: here we present modular scalable modelling methodology alleviates regulatory well combinatorial complexity biochemical networks
OWNX--: we first describe our modelling framework uses thermodynamically grounded treatment allostery ligands distinguish only conformational state allosteric proteins
OWNX--: we also introduce rule based modelling tool implements our methodology allosteric network compiler
AIMX--: we use anc examine how allostery make macromolecular assembly more efficacious
AIMX--: we then show how our modelling framework describes common mechanisms allostery mapping regulatory properties protein onto conformational changes protein itself demonstrate how we ease analysis multiple ligands interacting through allosteric protein
OWNX--: next we discuss how our approach reduces regulatory complexity thereby increases model s modularity
OWNX--: finally we use our framework develop model g protein coupled receptors whose regulatory complexity scales instead lg consequently greater predictive power
OWNX--: while our major goal introduce new modular modelling methodology rather than its implementation we made anc models we discuss available at link
