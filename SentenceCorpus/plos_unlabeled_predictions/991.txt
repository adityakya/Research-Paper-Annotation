MISC--: rise multi drug resistant extensively drug resistant tuberculosis around world including industrialized nations poses great threat human health defines need develop new effective inexpensive anti tubercular agents
OWNX--: previously we developed chemical systems biology approach identify off targets major pharmaceuticals proteome wide scale
OWNX--: this paper we further demonstrate value this approach through discovery existing commercially available drugs prescribed treatment parkinson s disease potential treat mdr xdr tuberculosis
OWNX--: drugs entacapone tolcapone predicted bind enzyme inha directly inhibit substrate binding
MISC--: prediction validated vitro inha kinetic assays using tablets comtan whose active component entacapone
MISC--: minimal inhibition concentration entacapone mycobacterium tuberculosis approximately m well below toxicity concentration determined vitro cytotoxicity model using human neuroblastoma cell line
MISC--: moreover kinetic assays indicate comtan inhibits inha activity percent at entacapone concentration approximately m thus active component comtan represents promising lead compound developing new class anti tubercular therapeutics excellent safety profiles
AIMX--: more generally protocol described this paper included drug discovery pipeline effort discover novel drug leads desired safety profiles therefore accelerate development new drugs
MISC--: tuberculosis caused bacterial pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis leading cause mortality among infectious diseases
MISC--: been estimated world health organization almost one third world s population around billion people infected disease citation
MISC--: every year more than million people develop active form disease subsequently claims lives nearly million
MISC--: this translates over deaths per day more than percent developing countries citation
MISC--: who estimated if worldwide spread tuberculosis was left unchecked then disease would responsible approximately million more deaths year
MISC--: despite current global situation anti tubercular drugs remained largely unchanged over last four decades citation
CONT--: widespread use agents time needed remove infection promoted emergence resistant m tuberculosis strains
MISC--: multi drug resistant tuberculosis defined resistance first line drugs isoniazid rifampin
MISC--: effective treatment mdr tb necessitates long term use second line drug combinations unfortunate consequence emergence extensively drug resistant tuberculosis m tuberculosis strains resistant isoniazid plus rifampin well key second line drugs ciprofloxacin moxifloxacin
OWNX--: xdr tb extremely difficult treat because only remaining drug classes exhibit very low potency high toxicity
MISC--: rise xdr tb around world including industrialized nations imposes great threat human health therefore emphasizing need identify new anti tubercular agents urgent priority citation
MISC--: currently anti infective therapeutics discovered developed either de novo strategies through extension available chemical compounds target protein families same similar structures functions
OWNX--: de novo drug discovery involves use high throughput screening techniques identify new compounds both synthetic natural novel drugs
MISC--: unfortunately this approach yielded very few successes field anti infective drug discovery citation
OWNX--: indeed progression early stage biochemical hits robust lead compounds commonly unfruitful process
OWNX--: identification both molecular targets essential survival pathogen compounds active intact cells challenging task
MISC--: even more formidable however requirement appropriate potency levels suitable pharmacokinetics order achieve efficacy small animal disease models citation
MISC--: challenges reflected high costs involved bringing new drugs market
MISC--: fact been estimated successful launch single new drug costs more than us million citation
MISC--: two alternative drug discovery strategies circumvent some challenges associated de novo drug discovery label extension piggy back strategies both widely employed discovery novel therapeutics treat tropical diseases
MISC--: label extension fast track approach involves extension indications existing treatment another disease
MISC--: some most important anti parasitic drugs use today praziquantel schistosomiasis were derived label extension process
MISC--: major advantages label extension significant reductions cost time market achieved
OWNX--: alternatively when molecular target present pathogen under investigation other commercial indications possible adopt piggy back strategy utilizing identified chemical starting points
CONT--: examples this approach include anti malarial screening lead series cysteine protease inhibitors treatment osteoporosis histone deacetylase inhibitors use cancer chemotherapy citation
MISC--: one main aims drug discovery develop safe effective therapeutic agents through optimization binding specific protein target
OWNX--: this way undesirable effects resulting side scatter pharmacology minimized
MISC--: however recent rapid completion numerous genome sequencing projects revealed proteins involved entirely different biochemical pathways even residing different tissues organs may possess functional binding pockets similar shapes physiochemical properties citation
MISC--: therefore chemical matter one target could considered basis leads entirely different target
MISC--: recent work large scale mapping polypharmacology interactions paolini et al citation revealed extent promiscuity drugs leads across proteome
OWNX--: they discovered around percent active compounds their database had observed activity more than one target
OWNX--: whilst majority promiscuous compounds were found active against targets within same gene family significant number had recorded activity across different gene families
MISC--: finding so many drugs interact more than one target provided rationale behind selective optimization side activities approach recently developed wermuth citation citation
CONT--: sosa approach involves use old drugs new pharmacological targets valuable concept considering finite number small molecules safely administered humans
CONT--: process itself involves screening limited number structurally diverse drug molecules then optimizing hits so they show stronger affinity new target weaker affinity original target
AIMX--: this way possible derive whole panel new active molecules single marketed drug
MISC--: since screened drug molecules already known safety bioavailability humans overall time cost drug discovery significantly reduced when compared de novo strategies
OWNX--: we developed novel computational strategy identify off targets major pharmaceuticals proteome wide scale citation citation
MISC--: our methodology extends scope sosa concept effectively systematically across gene families more likely successful achieving ultimate goal providing new drugs old ones
OWNX--: our chemical systems biology approach proceeds follows
MISC--: binding site commercially available drug extracted predicted d structure model target protein citation
MISC--: off targets similar ligand binding sites identified across proteome using efficient accurate functional site search algorithm citation
MISC--: atomic interactions between putative off targets drug evaluated using protein ligand docking
MISC--: only those off targets do not experience serious atomic clashes drug selected further analysis
MISC--: drug further optimized enhance its potency selectivity adme properties taking into account both primary target off targets across genome
OWNX--: our approach essentially explores complex protein ligand interaction networks proteome wide scale
OWNX--: lead compound discovered all drug targets across different gene families
