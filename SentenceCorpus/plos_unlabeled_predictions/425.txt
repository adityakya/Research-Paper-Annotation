OWNX--: five independent groups reported microarray studies identify dozens rhythmically expressed genes fruit fly drosophila melanogaster
CONT--: limited overlap among lists discovered genes makes difficult determine if any exhibit truly rhythmic patterns expression
OWNX--: we reanalyzed data all five reports found two sources observed discrepancies use different expression pattern detection algorithms underlying variation among datasets
AIMX--: improve upon methods originally employed we developed new analysis involves compilation all existing data application identical transformation standardization procedures followed anova based statistical prescreening three separate classes post hoc analysis cross correlation various cycling waveforms autocorrelation previously described fast fourier transform based technique citation citation
OWNX--: permutation based statistical tests were used derive significance measures all post hoc tests
OWNX--: we find application our method most significantly anova prescreening procedure significantly reduces false discovery rate relative observed among results original five reports while maintaining desirable statistical power
OWNX--: we identify set cycling transcripts previously found one more original reports well novel set transcripts not found any original studies
OWNX--: we introduce novel analysis method compensates variability observed among original five drosophila circadian array reports
OWNX--: based statistical fidelity our meta analysis results results our initial validation experiments we predict many our newly found genes bona fide cyclers suggest they may lead new insights into pathways through clock mechanisms regulate behavioral rhythms
MISC--: most organisms exhibit rhythms behavior physiology occur circadian daily periods
MISC--: rhythms driven endogenous biological clocks regulated via rhythmic expression core set pacemaker genes citation citation
MISC--: salient feature many circadian genes conserved across wide span evolutionary divergence cyclic expression their mrnas citation citation
OWNX--: several studies exploited this characteristic identify novel clock related genes
MISC--: five reports based model organism drosophila melanogaster utilize microarray technology discover clock related genes exhibit cyclic mrna expression fly heads citation citation citation
MISC--: cumulatively identify hundreds rhythmic transcripts yet there striking lack overlap among lists identified genes
MISC--: this raises doubts fidelity reported expression patterns citation citation
OWNX--: given importance rhythmic transcription circadian clock function we revisited studies attempting identify root causes existing incongruities find transcripts exhibit truly cyclic expression
OWNX--: our analyses suggest compilation statistical prescreening all available data lead substantial reductions false discovery rate
OWNX--: addition we find data quality algorithm choice play essential roles determining transcripts ultimately detected any particular analysis
OWNX--: we introduce novel procedure well improvements previously published techniques identify core set rhythmically expressed transcripts high statistical fidelity
OWNX--: intriguingly our list includes transcripts not found original reports
