MISC--: transitive inference class inclusion variety other inferential abilities strikingly similar developmental profiles all acquired around age five
MISC--: yet little known about reasons this correspondence
MISC--: category theory was invented formal means establishing commonalities between various mathematical structures
MISC--: we use category theory show transitive inference class inclusion involve dual mathematical structures called product coproduct
MISC--: other inferential tasks similar developmental profiles including matrix completion cardinality dimensional changed card sorting balance scale theory mind also involve structures
OWNX--: contrast products not involved behaviours exhibited younger children tasks simplified versions within their ability
MISC--: results point fundamental cognitive principle under development during childhood capacity compute products categorical sense
MISC--: children acquire various reasoning skills over remarkably similar periods development
MISC--: transitive inference class inclusion two behaviours among suite inferential abilities strikingly similar developmental profiles all acquired around age five years citation
MISC--: example older children infer if john taller than mary mary taller than sue then john taller than sue
MISC--: this form reasoning called transitive inference
MISC--: older children also understand grocery store will contain more fruit than apples
MISC--: number items belonging superclass greater than number items any one its subclasses
MISC--: this form reasoning called class inclusion
MISC--: two types inference appear little common
MISC--: transitive inference typically involves physical relationships between objects while class inclusion involves abstract relative sizes object classes
MISC--: nonetheless explicit tests other inferences range age groups revealed success was attained about median age five years citation
MISC--: since piaget decades research revealed important clues regarding development inference yet little known about reasons underlying correspondences
MISC--: common theme two recent proposals computing relational information citation citation
MISC--: regard relational complexity theory citation correspondence between commonly acquired cognitive behaviours based maximum arity relations must processed
MISC--: regard cognitive complexity control theory citation correspondence based common depth relation hierarchies
MISC--: although relational approach cognitive behaviour formal basis relational algebra citation certain assumptions must made about units analysis
MISC--: tasks diverse procedure content transitive inference class inclusion difficult see how analysis one task leads naturally other
MISC--: relational complexity theory transitive inference considered involve integration two binary relations between task elements into ordered triple ternary relation whereas class inclusion regarded integration three binary relations between three sets elements into ternary relation citation citation
MISC--: cognitive complexity control theory transitive inference involves relations over items whereas class inclusion involves relations over sets items
MISC--: this theoretical difficulty symptomatic general problem cognitive science where basic components cognition unknown
MISC--: absence detailed knowledge cognitive modelers been forced assume particular representational format
CONT--: this approach however does not lend itself current problem because elements transitive inference class inclusion tasks do not share common basis
MISC--: understandably then sorts behaviours tended studied detailed isolation narrowing scope identifying general principles
MISC--: category theory was born out desire establish formal commonalities between various mathematical structures citation citation since been applied analysis computational structures computer science
MISC--: seminal insight was shift objects primary focus analysis their transformations
MISC--: contrast instance sets defined terms objects they contain set theory against sets defined terms morphisms map them category theory citation
OWNX--: this insight motivates our categorical approach analysis inference our way around current impasse
MISC--: cognitive science several authors used category theory conceptual analysis space time citation citation though we know only one other application modeled empirical data citation
OWNX--: since our application category theory cognitive behaviour novel we first introduce basic category theory constructs needed our subsequent analysis transitive inference class inclusion other paradigms
OWNX--: analysis begins brief introduction sort data our approach intended explain primarily concerns contrasts between younger older children relative age five correlations across paradigms
OWNX--: finally we extend our categorical approach more complex levels inference
OWNX--: our main point despite apparent lack resemblance all tasks formally connected via categorical product defined below
MISC--: significance this result opens door entirely new approach identifying general principles particularly regard development inferential abilities less likely revealed standard modeling methods
