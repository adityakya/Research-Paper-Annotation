OWNX--: prevailing theory proposes brain s two visual pathways ventral dorsal lead differing visual processing world representations conscious perception than those action
MISC--: others claimed perception action share much their visual processing
OWNX--: but two neural architectures favored evolution
OWNX--: successful visual search life critical here we investigate evolution optimality neural mechanisms mediating perception eye movement actions visual search natural images
OWNX--: we implement approximation ideal bayesian searcher two separate processing streams one controlling eye movements other stream determining perceptual search decisions
OWNX--: we virtually evolved neural mechanisms searchers two separate pathways built linear combinations primary visual cortex receptive fields making simulated individuals probability survival depend perceptual accuracy finding targets cluttered backgrounds
OWNX--: we find variety targets backgrounds dependence target detectability retinal eccentricity mechanisms searchers two processing streams converge similar representations showing mismatches mechanisms perception eye movements lead suboptimal search
OWNX--: three exceptions resulted partial no convergence were case organism targets equally detectable across retina organism sufficient time foveate all possible target locations strict two pathway model no interconnections differential pre filtering based parvocellular magnocellular lateral geniculate cell properties
OWNX--: thus similar neural mechanisms perception eye movement actions during search optimal should expected effects natural selection organism limited time search food not equi detectable across its retina interconnected perception action neural pathways
OWNX--: neurophysiology studies macaque monkey citation citation support existence two functionally distinct neural pathways brain mediating processing visual information
MISC--: behavior patients brain damage led proposal perception mediated ventral stream projecting primary visual cortex inferior temporal cortex action mediated dorsal stream projecting primary visual cortex posterior parietal cortex citation citation
MISC--: although there been debate about whether this separation into ventral dorsal streams implies brain contains two distinct neural representations visual world citation citation there been no formal theoretical analysis about functional consequences two different neural architectures animal s survival
MISC--: visual search requires animals move their eyes point high resolution region eye fovea potentially interesting regions scene sub serve perceptual decisions localizing food predator
OWNX--: what impact having similar versus different neural mechanisms guiding eye movements mediating perceptual decisions visual search performance organism foveated visual system
OWNX--: we consider two leading computational models multiple fixation human visual search bayesian ideal searcher citation citation ideal saccadic targeting model search task target one eight locations equidistant initial fixation
MISC--: ideal searcher uses knowledge how detectability target varies retinal eccentricity statistics scenes move fovea spatial locations maximize accuracy perceptual decision at end search citation
MISC--: saccadic targeting model makes eye movements most probable target location citation citation optimal if goal was saccade target rather than collect information optimize subsequent perceptual decision citation
MISC--: depending spatial layout possible target locations visibility map map strategies lead similar diverging eye fixations
OWNX--: example steeply varying visibility map both models make eye movements possible target locations while broader visibility map ideal searcher tends make eye movements between possible target locations attempting obtain simultaneous close fovea processing more than one location
MISC--: covert attention allows both models select possible target locations ignore locations unlikely contain target when deciding saccade endpoints making perceptual search decisions citation citation
OWNX--: perceptual target localization decisions both models based visual information collected parallel over whole retina temporally integrated across saccades based location highest sensory evidence presence target
OWNX--: critically we implemented models two processing pathways one determining where move fovea other stream processing visual information reach final perceptual decision about target location
OWNX--: rather than having single linear mechanism perceptual template each pathway model had its own neural mechanism compared incoming visual data at each possible target location
OWNX--: likelihood ratios citation observed responses each mechanisms under hypothesis target present absent at location used make decisions about where move eyes perceptual decisions
OWNX--: we used genetic algorithm method find near optimal solutions perception action mechanisms but also simulate effects evolutionary process natural selection neural mechanisms driving saccadic eye movements perceptual decisions during search
OWNX--: computational complexity ideal bayesian searcher makes difficult virtually evolve model thus we used recently proposed approximation ideal searcher computationally faster
MISC--: elm model chooses fixation location minimizes uncertainty posterior probabilities over potential target locations
MISC--: decision rule simplified choose fixation location maximum sum likelihood ratios across potential target locations each weighted its squared detectability given fixation location citation
OWNX--: elm model shown approximate fixation patterns ideal searcher citation capture main characteristics fixation patterns our task visibility maps
MISC--: process virtual evolution started creation one thousand simulated individuals separate linear mechanisms perception eye movement programming
MISC--: each pathway s template each individual was created independent random combinations receptive fields twenty four v simple cells
MISC--: each simulated individual was allowed two eye movements before making final perceptual search decision about location target
MISC--: performance finding target one eight locations five thousand test images was evaluated probability survival individual was proportional its performance accuracy
MISC--: new generation was then created surviving individuals through process reproduction mutation cross over
MISC--: process was repeated up generations
