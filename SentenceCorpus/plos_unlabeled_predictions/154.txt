MISC--: classic algorithms needleman wunsch smith waterman find maximum posteriori probability alignment pair hidden markov model
MISC--: process large genomes undergone complex genome rearrangements almost all existing whole genome alignment methods apply fast heuristics divide genomes into small pieces suitable needleman wunsch alignment
MISC--: alignment methods standard practice fix parameters produce single alignment subsequent analysis biologists
MISC--: number alignment programs applied whole genome scale continues increase so does disagreement their results
MISC--: alignments produced different programs vary greatly especially non coding regions eukaryotic genomes where biologically correct alignment hard find
MISC--: parametric alignment one possible remedy
OWNX--: this methodology resolves issue robustness changes parameters finding all optimal alignments all possible parameters phmm
OWNX--: our main result construction whole genome parametric alignment drosophila melanogaster drosophila pseudoobscura
OWNX--: this alignment draws existing heuristics dividing whole genomes into small pieces alignment relies advances we made computing convex polytopes allow us parametrically align non coding regions using biologically realistic models
OWNX--: we demonstrate utility our parametric alignment biological inference showing cis regulatory elements more conserved between drosophila melanogaster drosophila pseudoobscura than previously thought
OWNX--: we also show how whole genome parametric alignment used quantitatively assess dependence branch length estimates alignment parameters
MISC--: needleman wunsch pairwise sequence alignment citation known sensitive parameter choices
OWNX--: illustrate problem consider eighth intron drosophila melanogaster cg ra gene located chr
MISC--: this intron base pairs long base pair ortholog drosophila pseudoobscura
MISC--: ortholog located at contig contig august freeze assembly produced baylor genome sequencing center
MISC--: using basic parameter scoring scheme two orthologous introns following optimal alignment when parameters set m x s
OWNX--: however if we change parameters m x s then following alignment optimal
MISC--: note relatively small change parameters produces very different alignment introns
MISC--: this problem exacerbated more complex scoring schemes central issue whole genome alignments produced programs mavid citation blastz multiz citation
CONT--: indeed although whole genome alignment systems use many heuristics rapidly identifying alignable regions subsequently aligning them they all rely needleman wunsch algorithm at some level
MISC--: dependence parameters becomes even more crucial issue multiple alignment more than two sequences
MISC--: parametric alignment was introduced waterman eggert lander citation further developed gusfield et al citation citation fernandez baca et al citation approach overcoming difficulties selecting parameters needleman wunsch alignment
MISC--: see citation review citation citation algebraic perspective
MISC--: parametric alignment amounts partitioning space parameters into regions
MISC--: parameters same region lead same optimal alignments
MISC--: enumerating all regions non trivial problem computational geometry
OWNX--: we solve this problem whole genome scale up five free parameters
CONT--: our approach parametric alignment rests idea score alignment specified short list numbers derived alignment
OWNX--: instance given standard three parameter scoring scheme we summarize each alignment number m matches number x mismatches number s spaces alignment
MISC--: triple called alignment summary
MISC--: example consider above pair orthologous drosophila introns
OWNX--: first alignment alignment summary while second alignment alignment summary
MISC--: remarkably even though number all alignments two sequences very large number alignment summaries arise needleman wunsch alignment very small
MISC--: specifically example above where two sequences lengths total number alignments
CONT--: there only alignment summaries highest score some choice parameters m x s biologically reasonable choices i e when we require m x s x only six summaries optimal
MISC--: six summaries account total optimal alignments
OWNX--: note basic model discussed above only d free parameters because pair sequences lengths l l all summaries satisfy
MISC--: this relation holds l l six summaries table
OWNX--: figure shows alignment polygon defined section alignment polytopes coordinates
MISC--: general two dna sequences lengths l l number optimal alignment summaries bounded above polynomial l l degree d where d number free parameters model citation citation
MISC--: d this degree so number optimal alignment summaries sublinear growth relative sequence lengths
MISC--: even d growth exponent d only
OWNX--: this means all optimal alignment summaries computed large scale models few parameters
MISC--: growth exponent d was derived gusfield et al citation d fernandez baca at al citation pachter sturmfels citation general d table computed using software xparal citation
OWNX--: this software works d d generates representation all optimal alignments respect all reasonable choices parameters
CONT--: although xparal convenient graphical interface seems this program not been widely used biologists perhaps because not designed high throughput data analysis number free parameters restricted d
AIMX--: this paper we demonstrate parametric sequence alignment made practical whole genome scale we argue computing output table very useful comparative genomics applications where reliable alignments essential
MISC--: this end we introduce mathematical point view based organizing principle convexity was absent earlier studies citation citation citation
MISC--: our advances rely new algorithms quite different what implemented xparal perform well practice even if number d free parameters greater than three
MISC--: convexity organizing principle reveals needles haystack
OWNX--: our example haystack consists more than alignments needles optimal alignments
MISC--: summaries optimal alignments vertices alignment polytope
OWNX--: alignment polytope convex hull summaries all alignments
OWNX--: background convex hulls how compute alignment polytopes provided section genomes polytopes
OWNX--: thus parametric alignment two dna sequences relative some chosen pair hidden markov model means constructing alignment polytope two sequences
MISC--: dimension alignment polytope d number free model parameters
MISC--: d polytope convex polygon shown figure pair introns above
MISC--: basic model insufficient genomics applications
MISC--: more realistic phmms sequence alignment include gap penalties
OWNX--: we consider three models

OWNX--: our methods computational results described next section
MISC--: three biological applications presented section polytopes biology
OWNX--: discussion follows discussion section
OWNX--: our main computational result construction whole genome parametric alignment two drosophila genomes
MISC--: this result depended number innovations
OWNX--: adapting existing orthology mapping methods we were able divide genomes into pairs reliably orthologous segments among we identified pairs alignment uncertain
OWNX--: we computed alignment polytopes dimensions two three four each sequence pairs dimension five subset them
OWNX--: methods explained section alignment polytopes
MISC--: vertices polytopes represent optimal alignment summaries robustness cones
OWNX--: concepts introduced section models alignment summaries robustness cones
OWNX--: computational results presented section computational results
OWNX--: orthology mapping problem pair genomes identify all orthologous segments between two genomes
MISC--: orthologous segments if selected so not contain genome rearrangements then globally aligned each other
OWNX--: this strategy frequently used whole genome alignment citation citation we adapted our parametric alignment computation
MISC--: mercator orthology mapping program suitable multiple genomes was developed dewey et al citation
OWNX--: we applied this program d melanogaster d pseudoobscura genomes identify pieces parametric alignment
MISC--: mercator strategy identifying orthologous segments follows
MISC--: exon annotations each genome translated into amino acid sequences then compared each other using blat citation
MISC--: annotations based reference gene sets ab initio predictions
OWNX--: resulting exon hits then used build graph whose vertices correspond exons edge between two exons if there good hit
OWNX--: greedy algorithm then used select edges graph correspond runs exons consistent order orientation
MISC--: mercator orthology map d melanogaster d pseudoobscura segments
MISC--: however order obtain map suitable parametric alignment further subdivision segments was necessary
MISC--: this subdivision was accomplished additional step identifying fixing exact matches length at least bp
OWNX--: we derived constraints four possible types exact matching non coding sequences ungapped high scoring aligned coding sequences segment pairs between two other constraints where one segments length zero so non trivial segment must gapped single nucleotide mismatches squeezed between other constraints
OWNX--: we then removed all segments where sequences contained letter n this process resulted pairs segments parametric alignment
MISC--: lengths d melanogaster segments range one base pairs
MISC--: median length bp mean length bp
OWNX--: all percent d melanogaster genome percent d pseudoobscura genome were aligned our method
