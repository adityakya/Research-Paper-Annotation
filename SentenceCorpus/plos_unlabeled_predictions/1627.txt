OWNX--: spectro temporal receptive fields been widely used linear approximations signal transform sound spectrograms neural responses along auditory pathway
MISC--: their dependence statistical attributes stimuli sound intensity usually explained nonlinear mechanisms models
OWNX--: here we apply efficient coding principle been successfully used understand receptive fields early stages visual processing order provide computational understanding strfs
MISC--: according this principle strfs result optimal tradeoff between maximizing sensory information brain receives minimizing cost neural activities required represent transmit this information
MISC--: both terms depend statistical properties sensory inputs noise corrupts them
MISC--: strfs should therefore depend input power spectrum signal noise ratio assumed increase input intensity
OWNX--: we analytically derive optimal strfs when signal noise approximated gaussians
MISC--: under constraint they should spectro temporally local strfs predicted adapt being band pass low pass filters input intensity reduces input correlation becomes longer range sound frequency time
MISC--: predictions qualitatively match physiological observations
OWNX--: our prediction how strfs should determined input power spectrum could readily tested since this spectrum depends stimulus ensemble
OWNX--: potentials limitations efficient coding principle discussed
MISC--: response acoustic input signals neurons auditory pathway typically selective sound frequency formula particular response latencies
MISC--: at least ignoring cases formula khz neuronal responses often phase lock sound waves spectro temporal receptive field often used describe tuning properties neuron citation citation citation citation
MISC--: this two dimensional function formula reports sensitivity neuron at response latency formula acoustic inputs frequency formula given stimulus ensemble
MISC--: more specifically stimulus ensemble power formula acoustic input at frequency formula at time formula fluctuates around average level denoted formula
OWNX--: if we let formula denote neuron s response at time formula then formula best approximates linear relationship between formula formula this stimulus ensemble asformulanote this paper we refer formula input spectrogram although some authors also include average input power formula
OWNX--: though formula not full description acoustic input since ignores features phase oscillation sound wave only relevant aspect auditory input far strf concerned
OWNX--: note if we use formula denote deviation neural response its spontaneous activity level then both formula formula zero mean
AIMX--: we will use this simplification throughout paper
MISC--: studies temporal dimension omitted strf called spectral receptive field
OWNX--: figure cartoons typical strf
MISC--: this excitatory inhibitory regions reflecting its preferred frequency response latency
MISC--: example if formula peaks at frequency formula time formula then this neuron prefers frequency formula should respond input impulse formula this frequency latency formula
OWNX--: we will also refer formula receptive field filter kernel transfer function input neural responses all convey same similar meanings
MISC--: neuron s strf typically estimated using reverse correlation methods citation citation
MISC--: however there extensive nonlinearities signal transformation along auditory pathway
OWNX--: indeed strf formulation neural responses though linear spectral power already second order nonlinear function auditory sound wave
MISC--: there two kinds nonlinearities when inputs represented spectrograms
MISC--: simpler one static nonlinearity formula when applied linear approximation formula equation enables better predictions neural responses citation citation
MISC--: this static nonlinearity however does not alter spectro temporal selectivity neuron seen linear strf
MISC--: this paper interested more complex nonlinearity strfs dependent stimulus ensemble used estimate them citation citation citation citation
MISC--: example strfs wider when stimuli narrow band rather than wide band citation when stimuli animal vocalizations rather than noise citation
MISC--: strf also becomes more band pass when sound intensity increases
MISC--: dependence strfs stimulus ensemble holds example type iv neurons cochlear nucleus cats citation citation inferior colliculus frog citation gerbil citation field l region songbird citation
MISC--: nonlinearities auditory system become progressively stronger further periphery
OWNX--: despite nonlinearities concept strf still widely used not only because provides meaningful description spectro temporal selectivity neurons given stimulus ensemble but also because predict neural responses novel stimuli reasonably well long stimuli drawn same stimulus ensemble used estimate strf first place
MISC--: reasonable predictions strfs been obtained responses auditory nerves auditory midbrain neurons citation citation citation
MISC--: they also been obtained responses auditory cortical neurons when stimulus ensemble composed biologically more meaningful static dynamic ripples
OWNX--: if linear neural filter augmented include filtering performed head ears also possible predict preferred locations sound sources auditory cortical neurons based linear neural filter input spectrograms citation
MISC--: meanwhile linear strf models fail capture many complex phenomena particularly auditory cortex nonlinearities not limited being just static monotonic
OWNX--: been suggested some auditory cortical neurons process auditory objects highly non linear manner selectively responding weak object component while ignoring loud components occupy same region frequency space auditory mixtures object components citation some prefer low over high spectral contrast sounds citation
MISC--: strong nonlinearities auditory processes long since motivated nonlinear models auditory responses
AIMX--: this paper aims understand computational rather than mechanistic perspective why auditory encoding transform should depend stimulus ensemble ways observed
OWNX--: more specifically paper focuses cases strfs reasonably capture neural responses aims identify understand computational goal strfs given stimulus ensemble finding metric according strfs optimal ensemble
OWNX--: this would provide rationale how physiologically measured strfs should depend adapt stimulus ensemble
AIMX--: this paper does not address what linear nonlinear mechanisms could build optimal strfs whether how nonlinear auditory processes enable adaptation strfs stimulus ensemble
MISC--: existing computational models auditory neurons including ones notion cochlear hair cells perform independent component analysis provide efficient code inputs using spikes auditory nerves citation citation cannot explain observed dependence strfs stimulus ensemble
OWNX--: restricting attention temporal properties strf lesica grothe citation observed temporal filter strf adapted level ambient noise input environment
MISC--: particular temporal receptive field strf changed being bandpass being low pass increase ambient noise
MISC--: they argued using simple model adaptation strf enables more efficient coding input information
OWNX--: this study applies principles efficient coding understand auditory strf its variations sound intensities other input characteristics
MISC--: generalizes work lesica grothe citation understand temporal spectral filtering characteristics strf adaptation changes noise signal correlations input statistics
MISC--: explicitly principle efficient coding states neural receptive fields should enable neural responses transmit much sensory information possible central nervous system subject limitation neural cost representing transmitting information
MISC--: this principle been proposed citation successfully applied visual system understand receptive fields early visual pathway citation citation citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: we will borrow heavily techniques intuitions vision derive explain results this paper
MISC--: make initial progress necessary start some simplifying assumptions
OWNX--: first we assume statistical characteristics stimulus ensemble do not change more rapidly than speed at sensory encoding adapts so stimulus ensemble approximated being stationary far optimal encoding concerned
MISC--: knowing when this assumption does not hold tells us when encoding not optimal e g when one sees poorly brief moment before visual encoding adapts sudden change dark room bright garden
OWNX--: second mathematical convenience we assume linear strf model equation approximate adapted auditory neural responses reasonably well
OWNX--: we know above this assumption often does not hold particularly auditory cortical neurons
OWNX--: this paper leaves extension optimal encoding nonlinear cases future studies
OWNX--: third derive closed form analytical solution optimal strf we assume input statistics stimulus ensemble approximated being gaussian higher order correlations input contributing only negligibly inefficiency representation original sensory inputs
BASE--: although known natural auditory inputs far gaussian citation case vision discrepancy may only limited impact input inefficiency measured amount information redundancy original sensory input citation citation citation
OWNX--: understand how sensory inputs should recoded increase coding efficiency we start visual encoding draw insights made analogies auditory encoding
MISC--: vision large amounts raw data about visual world transduced photoreceptors
MISC--: however optic nerve transmits input data visual cortex via thalamus only accommodate dramatically smaller data rate
CONT--: thus been proposed early visual processes use efficient coding strategy encode much information possible given limited bandwidth citation citation other words recode data redundancy data reduced consequently data transmitted limited bandwidth
MISC--: compression possible since images very redundant citation citation citation citation e g strong correlations between visual inputs at nearby points time space
MISC--: removing correlations cut down data rate substantially citation
MISC--: one way remove correlations transform raw input formula into different representation formula neural responses would then much smaller data rate than formula yet preserving essential input information
OWNX--: this transform often approximated visual receptive field analogous auditory strfs
MISC--: instance center surround receptive fields retinal ganglion cells help remove spatial redundancy citation citation citation
MISC--: they do this making ganglion cells preferentially respond spatial contrast input so eliminating responses visual locations whose input redundant their neighbors
MISC--: consequently responses retinal ganglion cells much less correlated than those photoreceptors making their representation much more efficient
MISC--: one facet this efficient encoding hypothesis optimal receptive field transform should depend statistical properties correlation structure intensity input
MISC--: this dependence been used explain adaptation changes input statistics visual receptive field characteristics sizes center surround regions color tuning retinal neurons ocular dominance properties striate cortical neurons citation citation citation citation citation citation
MISC--: auditory system information redundancy also reduced along auditory pathway citation
OWNX--: although this redundancy reduction was only investigated neural responses sensory inputs rather than coding transform leading neural responses suggested coding efficiency one goals early auditory processes
OWNX--: more formally efficient coding scheme depicted figure
MISC--: input contains sensory signal formula noise formula
MISC--: net input formula encoded linear transfer function formula into output formulawhich also contains additional noise formula introduced encoding process
MISC--: when input multiple channels e g many different photoreceptors hair cells formula vector many components indeed formula
OWNX--: output formula vector representing neural population responses many neurons
OWNX--: output neuron formula we formula
MISC--: therefore formula matrix its formula row formula models receptive field output neuron formula array effective weights input receptors formula output neuron formula
MISC--: particular example when input neurons photoreceptors output neurons retinal ganglion cells formula effective connection photoreceptor formula ganglion cell formula collectively formula describe linear receptive field this ganglion cell
MISC--: we consider problem finding optimal formula maximizes information extracted formula about formula i e mutual information formula citation between formula formula subject given cost neural encoding depends responses way we will describe shortly
MISC--: therefore optimal formula should minimize objective function formulawhere formula parameter whose value specifies particular balance between needs minimize costs maximize extracted information
OWNX--: neural costs arise various sources metabolic energy cost generating neural activities spikes citation cost thicker axons transmit higher rates neural firing
MISC--: we follow formulation been productive vision citation citation model neural cost asformulawhere formula indicates average over stimulus ensemble
MISC--: this givesformulait been shown citation citation citation citation formula provides most efficient coding according formula following properties
MISC--: at high signal noise ratio formula formula extracts difference between correlated channels thus avoids transmitting redundant information
MISC--: hence example photopic conditions retinal ganglion cells center surround spatial receptive fields extract spatial contrast input
OWNX--: contrast at low snr formula smoothing filter averages out input noise instead reducing redundancy
OWNX--: this avoids spending neural cost transmitting noise
MISC--: hence example scotopic conditions when snr considered being low receptive fields retinal ganglion cells expand sizes their center regions weaken their suppressive surrounds citation
OWNX--: we will apply this framework auditory encoding understand strfs their adaptation stimulus ensembles
