OWNX--: compelling behavioral evidence suggests humans make optimal decisions despite uncertainty inherent perceptual motor tasks
MISC--: key question neuroscience how populations spiking neurons implement probabilistic computations
OWNX--: this article we develop comprehensive framework optimal spike based sensory integration working memory dynamic environment
OWNX--: we propose probability distributions inferred spike per spike recurrently connected networks integrate fire neurons
MISC--: result networks combine sensory cues optimally track state time varying stimulus memorize accumulated evidence over periods much longer than time constant single neurons
OWNX--: importantly we propose population responses persistent working memory states represent entire probability distributions not only single stimulus values
MISC--: memories reflected sustained asynchronous patterns activity make relevant information available downstream neurons within their short time window integration
MISC--: model neurons act predictive encoders only firing spikes account new information not yet been signaled
MISC--: thus spike times signal deterministically prediction error contrary rate codes spike times considered random samples underlying firing rate
MISC--: consequence this coding scheme multitude spike patterns reliably encode same information
OWNX--: this results weakly correlated poisson like spike trains sensitive initial conditions but robust even high levels external neural noise
MISC--: this spike train variability reproduces one observed cortical sensory spike trains but cannot equated noise
MISC--: contrary consequence optimal spike based inference
OWNX--: contrast we show rate based models perform poorly when implemented stochastically spiking neurons
MISC--: our senses furnish us information about external world ambiguous corrupted noise
OWNX--: taking this uncertainty into account crucial successful interaction our environment

OWNX--: particular optimal cue combination reduces simple linear combination neural activities broad family neural variability including poisson gaussian noise citation
CONT--: however most studies neglect crucial dimension perception time
MISC--: most sensory stimuli vary dynamically natural environment requires sensory representations constructed integrated combined line citation citation
MISC--: perceptual inference thus cannot based rates spike counts measured during fixed temporal window used most previous population coding frameworks
CONT--: at same time reliable decisions typically require integration sensory evidence over hundreds milliseconds citation citation largely exceeds integrative time constant single neurons
MISC--: unclear how leaky devices could compute sums spike counts typical time scale perceptual motor tasks
MISC--: problem even more crucial if decision delayed compared presentation sensory information
MISC--: sensory variables direction motion stimulus retained working memory significant periods time even absence sensory input
MISC--: neural correlates this working memory appear persistent neural activity parietal frontal brain areas exhibit firing statistics similar those found sensory responses citation citation citation
MISC--: this persistent activity been modeled stable state recurrent neural network dynamics citation
MISC--: however attractors correspond stereotyped patterns activity only represent single stimulus value
MISC--: example memorized position object encoded position stable bump activity citation citation
MISC--: this would imply though information about reliability memorized cue lost cannot used delayed cue combination decision making
OWNX--: we hypothesize instead stimuli memorized same format sensory input i e probability distribution
MISC--: question how probability distributions memorized population neurons remains largely unanswered
OWNX--: here we approach issues using new interpretation population coding context temporal sensory integration
OWNX--: we consider spikes rather than rates basic unit probabilistic representation
AIMX--: we show how recurrent networks leaky integrate fire neurons construct combine memorize probability distributions dynamic sensory variables
OWNX--: spike generation neurons results competition between integration evidence feed forward sensory inputs prediction lateral connections
MISC--: neuron therefore acts predictive encoder only spiking if its input cannot predicted its own its neighbors past activity
OWNX--: we demonstrate networks integrate combine sensory inputs optimally i e without losing information track stimulus dynamics spike per spike even absence sensory input over timescales much longer than neural time constants
OWNX--: this framework thus provides first comprehensive theory optimal spike based sensory integration working memory
MISC--: contrast rate models implemented poisson spiking neurons this model does not require large levels redundancy compensate noise added stochastic spike generation
OWNX--: similar cortical sensory neurons model neurons respond sustained asynchronous spiking activity
MISC--: spike times variable uncorrelated despite deterministic spike generation rule
MISC--: however contrast rate codes each spike counts
OWNX--: trial trial variability spike trains does not reflect intrinsic source noise requires averaging but consequence predictive coding
OWNX--: while spike times unpredictable at level single neuron they deterministically represent probability distribution at level population
OWNX--: this leads us reinterpret notions signal noise cortical neural responses
