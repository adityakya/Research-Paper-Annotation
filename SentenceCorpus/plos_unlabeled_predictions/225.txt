MISC--: our investigation knotted structures protein data bank reveals most complicated knot discovered date
OWNX--: we suggest occurrence this knot human ubiquitin hydrolase might related role enzyme protein degradation
OWNX--: while knots usually preserved among homologues we also identify exception transcarbamylase
MISC--: this allows us exemplify function knots proteins suggest how they may been created
MISC--: although knots abundant complex globular homopolymers citation citation they rare simple proteins citation citation
MISC--: sixteen methyltransferases bacteria viruses combined into knot superfamily citation several isozymes carbonic anhydrase known knotted
MISC--: apart two folds only few insular knots been reported citation citation citation citation some were derived incomplete structures citation citation
MISC--: most part knotted proteins contain simple trefoil knots represented three essential crossings projection onto plane
OWNX--: only three proteins were identified four projected crossings
OWNX--: this report we provide first comprehensive review knots proteins considers all entries protein data bank citation not just subset
MISC--: this allows us examine knots homologous proteins
OWNX--: our analysis reveals several new knots all enzymes
MISC--: particular we discovered most complicated knot found date human ubiquitin hydrolase suggest its entangled topology protects against being pulled into proteasome
OWNX--: we also noticed knots usually preserved among structural homologues
MISC--: sequence similarity appears strong indicator preservation topology although differences between knotted unknotted structures sometimes subtle
OWNX--: interestingly we also identified novel knot transcarbamylase not present homologues known structure
OWNX--: we show presence this knot alters functionality protein suggest how knot may been created first place
MISC--: mathematically knots rigorously defined closed loops citation
OWNX--: fortunately both n c termini open proteins typically accessible surface connected unambiguously we reduce protein its c backbone draw two lines outward starting at termini direction connection line between center mass backbone respective ends citation
MISC--: lines joined big loop structure topologically classified determination its alexander polynomial citation citation
OWNX--: applying this method protein data bank version january we found knotted structures entries contain proteins
MISC--: knots formed disulfide citation citation hydrogen bonds citation were not included study
