MISC--: we describe comparative patch analysis modeling structures multidomain proteins protein complexes apply psd protein
MISC--: comparative patch analysis hybrid comparative modeling based template complex protein docking greater applicability than comparative modeling higher accuracy than docking
MISC--: relies structurally defined interactions each complex components their homologs any other protein irrespective its fold
MISC--: each component its known binding modes other proteins any fold collected expanded known binding modes its homologs
OWNX--: modes then used restrain conventional molecular docking resulting set binary domain complexes subsequently ranked geometric complementarity statistical potential

MISC--: currently there two computational approaches predict structure protein complex given structures its components comparative modeling citation citation protein protein docking citation citation
MISC--: first approach modelling target complex standard comparative modelling threading methods build model using known structure homologous complex template citation citation

MISC--: experimental information obtained nmr chemical shift mapping residual dipolar couplings cross linking also used guide protein docking citation citation
MISC--: while docking applicable any two subunits whose structures known modeled both sampling relevant configurations discrimination native like configurations large number non native alternatives remain challenging citation
AIMX--: here we propose third approach modeling complexes between two structures
MISC--: approach called comparative patch analysis hybrid protein docking comparative modeling based template complex greater applicability than comparative modeling higher accuracy than docking
MISC--: comparative patch analysis relies our prior analysis location binding sites within families homologous domains citation
MISC--: this analysis indicated locations binding sites often conserved irrespective folds their binding partners
MISC--: structure target complex thus modeled restricting protein docking only those binding sites employed homologous domains
OWNX--: result comparative patch analysis benefits knowledge all interactions involving either one two partners
