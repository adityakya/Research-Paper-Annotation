MISC--: recent times stochastic treatments gene regulatory processes appeared literature cell exposed signaling molecule its environment triggers synthesis specific protein through network intracellular reactions
MISC--: stochastic nature this process leads distribution protein levels population cells determined fokker planck equation
OWNX--: often instability occurs consequence two steady state protein levels one at low end representing off state other at high end representing state given concentration signaling molecule within suitable range
MISC--: consequence bistability been appearance bimodal distributions indicating two different populations one off state other state
MISC--: bimodal distribution come about stochastic analysis single cell
CONT--: however concerted action population altering extracellular concentration environment individual cells hence their behavior only accomplished appropriate population balance model accounts reciprocal effects interaction between population its environment
AIMX--: this study we show how formulate population balance model stochastic gene expression individual cells incorporated
MISC--: interestingly simulation model shows bistability neither sufficient nor necessary bimodal distributions population
MISC--: original notion linking bistability bimodal distribution single cell stochastic model therefore only special consequence population balance model
OWNX--: study cell populations vastly improved flow cytometry access multivariate distribution measures cell populations advanced considerably calling concomitant application theory sensitive population heterogeneity
MISC--: this regard population balance framework fredrickson et al citation provided requisite modeling machinery same
OWNX--: while this recognition generally exists literature modeling gene regulatory processes been at single cell level based being viewed average cell
MISC--: since gene regulatory processes typically involve small number molecules reaction network stochastic its dynamics feature included single cell analysis
OWNX--: further issue importance bistability occurs when two levels gene expression one high referred other low referred off exist given concentration signaling molecule
MISC--: this issue very much part stochastic modeling single cell citation citation
MISC--: several kinds stochastic models been developed two them been broadly used stochastic simulation algorithm citation citation fokker planck equation stochastic differential equations citation citation
MISC--: stochastic model certainly cures drawback deterministic model describes only averaged behavior large populations without realizing fluctuating behaviors different cells
MISC--: bistability been studied extensively through experiments theoretical analysis numerical simulations citation citation citation citation
MISC--: bistable system characterized existence two stable steady states
OWNX--: modes relating two stable steady states appear bimodal distribution population
MISC--: coexistence bistability bimodal distribution been shown many publications citation citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: however almost all modeling works stochastic gene regulation relate processes at single cell level
MISC--: outcome numerous simulated trajectories single cell behavior been interpreted population behavior
OWNX--: cell assumed act totally independently other cells without regard fact signaling environment continuously altered concerted action all members population
MISC--: no interaction between other cells been taken into consideration models could indeed lead serious bias
MISC--: drawback single cell model may overcome applying population balance approach citation
MISC--: detailed general framework application population balances microbial populations was developed fredrickson et al citation
MISC--: however population balance model cited work many others followed literature based deterministic behavior particulate entities
MISC--: ramkrishna citation shows how pbm accommodate random particulate behavior described stochastic differential equations
OWNX--: this study we demonstrate formulating stochastic gene regulation incorporating pbm capable tracing time evolution behavior entire cell population
MISC--: system pheromone induced conjugative plasmid transfer citation contributing dissemination antibiotic resistance virulence enterococcus faecalis infections citation citation been simulated this study example critical difference between stochastic gene regulation incorporating pbm single cell stochastic model
AIMX--: our objective this paper formulate population balance models stochastic gene expression single cells
BASE--: further we explore circumstances under bimodal distributions observed protein distributions particular we investigate generally prevailing view literature bistability bimodality protein distribution occur concurrently citation citation citation citation citation
MISC--: exception this view appears work karmakar bose citation citation who showed bimodal distributions arise without bistability when reaction time downstream gene regulation short relative time required change dna conformation
MISC--: other similar publications also found literature citation citation
OWNX--: while cited works show bimodal distributions without bistability must understood their conclusions based mechanistic differences behavior isolated single cells
AIMX--: this study we approach issue relationship between bistability bimodality rational viewpoint i e examine nature protein distribution cells without bistability within framework population balances
MISC--: thus circumstances will investigated figure bimodal distributions arise without bistability figure b unimodal distributions arise even when bistability exists
