MISC--: metagenomics discipline enables genomic study uncultured microorganisms
OWNX--: faster cheaper sequencing technologies ability sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly their habitats expanding transforming our view microbial world
MISC--: distilling meaningful information millions new genomic sequences presents serious challenge bioinformaticians
MISC--: cultured microbes genomic data come single clone making sequence assembly annotation tractable
MISC--: metagenomics data come heterogeneous microbial communities sometimes containing more than species sequence data being noisy partial
MISC--: sampling assembly gene calling function prediction bioinformatics faces new demands interpreting voluminous noisy often partial sequence data
MISC--: although metagenomics relative newcomer science past few years seen explosion computational methods applied metagenomic based research
OWNX--: therefore not within scope this article provide exhaustive review
MISC--: rather we provide here concise yet comprehensive introduction current computational requirements presented metagenomics review recent progress made
MISC--: we also note whether there software implements any methods presented here briefly review its utility
OWNX--: nevertheless would useful if readers this article would avail themselves comment section provided this journal relate their own experiences
OWNX--: finally last section this article provides few representative studies illustrating different facets recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics
MISC--: most its history life earth consisted solely microscopic life forms microbial life still dominates earth many aspects
MISC--: estimated prokaryotic cells inhabiting our planet sequester some petagrams carbon pg nitrogen pg phosphorous making them largest reservoir those nutrients earth citation
MISC--: bacteria archaea live all environments capable sustaining other life many cases sole inhabitants extreme environments deep sea vents temperatures c rocks found boreholes km beneath earth s surface
MISC--: bacteria archea microeukaryotes dominate earth s habitats compound recycling nutrient sequestration according some estimates biomass
MISC--: microbes not only ubiquitous they essential all life they primary source nutrients primary recyclers dead matter back available organic form
MISC--: along all other animals plants human condition profoundly affected microbes scourges human farm animal crop pandemics benefits agriculture food industry medicine name few
OWNX--: we humans more bacterial cells inhabiting our body than our own cells citation citation
MISC--: been stated key understanding human condition lies understanding human genome citation citation
MISC--: but given our intimate relationship microbes citation researching human genome now understood necessary though insufficient condition sequencing genomes our own microbes would necessary too
OWNX--: also better understand role microbes biosphere would necessary undertake genomic study them well
MISC--: study microbial genomes started late s sequencing genomes bacteriophages ms citation x citation
MISC--: microbiology took major step sequencing first bacterial genome haemophilus influenza citation
MISC--: genomes bacterial viral archaeal species deposited genbank release
MISC--: having hand large number microbial genomes changed nature microbiology microbial evolution studies
MISC--: providing ability examine relationship genome structure function across many different species data also opened up fields comparative genomics systems biology
MISC--: nevertheless single organism genome studies limits
OWNX--: first technology limitations mean organism must first clonally cultured sequence its entire genome
MISC--: however only small percentage microbes nature cultured means extant genomic data highly biased do not represent true picture genomes microbial species citation citation
MISC--: second very rarely do microbes live single species communities species interact both each other their habitats may also include host organisms
OWNX--: therefore clonal culture also fails represent true state affairs nature respect organism interaction resulting population genomic variance biological functions
MISC--: new sequencing technologies drastic reduction cost sequencing helping us overcome limits
OWNX--: we now ability obtain genomic information directly microbial communities their natural habitats
OWNX--: suddenly instead looking at few species individually we able study tens thousands all together
BASE--: sequence data taken directly environment were dubbed metagenome citation study sequence data directly environment metagenomics citation
MISC--: however environmental sequencing comes its own information restricting price tag
MISC--: single organism genomics practically all microbe s genome sequenced providing complete picture genome
OWNX--: we know species dna rna originated
OWNX--: after assembly location genes operons transcriptional units computationally inferred
MISC--: control elements other cues identified infer transcriptional translational units
OWNX--: consequently we achieve nearly complete well ordered picture all genomic elements sequenced organism
AIMX--: we may not recognize all elements what they some errors may creep but we gauge breadth our knowledge properly annotate those areas genome we manage decipher
OWNX--: contrast sequences obtained environmental genomic studies fragmented
MISC--: each fragment was obviously sequenced specific species but there many different species single sample most full genome not available
MISC--: many cases impossible determine true species origin
MISC--: length each fragment anywhere between base pairs bp depending sequencing method used
MISC--: short sequence reads dissociated their original species assembled lengths usually not exceeding bp consequently reconstruction whole genome generally not possible
MISC--: even reconstruction entire transcriptional unit problematic
MISC--: addition being fragmented incomplete volume sequence data acquired environmental sequencing several orders magnitude larger than acquired single organism genomics
MISC--: reasons computational biologists been developing new algorithms analyze metagenomic data
MISC--: computational challenges new very exciting
OWNX--: we entering era akin first genomic revolution almost two decades ago
MISC--: whole organism genomics allows us examine evolution not only single genes but whole transcriptional units chromosomes cellular networks
MISC--: but more recently metagenomics gave us ability study most fundamental genomic level relationship between microbes communities habitats they live
MISC--: how does adaptation microbes different environments including host animals other microbes manifest itself their genomes
MISC--: us humans this question strike very close home when those habitats our own bodies microbes associated our own well being illnesses almost every aspect human life well life every other living being planet affected microbes
MISC--: we now experimental technology understand microbial communities how they affect us but sheer volume fragmentary nature data challenge computational biologists distill all data into useful information
OWNX--: this article we shall briefly outline some experimental technological computational achievements challenges associated metagenomic data sequence generation assembly through various levels metagenomic annotation
OWNX--: we will also discuss computational issues unique environmental genomics estimating metagenome size handling associated metadata
OWNX--: finally we will review some studies highlighting advantages metagenomic based research some insights enabled
