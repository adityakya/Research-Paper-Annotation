MISC--: individual perception vaccine safety important factor determining person s adherence vaccination program its consequences disease control
MISC--: this perception belief about safety given vaccine not static parameter but variable subject environmental influence
MISC--: complicate matters perception risk does not correspond actual risk
AIMX--: this paper we propose way include dynamics beliefs into realistic epidemiological model yielding more complete depiction mechanisms underlying unraveling vaccination campaigns
MISC--: methodology proposed based bayesian inference extended model more complex belief systems associated decision models
OWNX--: we found method able produce behaviors approximate what been observed real vaccine disease scare situations
MISC--: framework presented comprises set useful tools adequate quantitative representation common yet complex public health issue
OWNX--: tools include representation beliefs bayesian probabilities usage logarithmic pooling combine probability distributions representing opinions usage natural conjugate priors efficiently compute bayesian posterior
OWNX--: this approach allowed comprehensive treatment uncertainty regarding vaccination behavior realistic epidemiological model
OWNX--: since early vaccination campaigns against smallpox vaccination policies been matter debate citation mass vaccination versus blocking strategies compulsory versus voluntary some highly debated issues
MISC--: despite early controversies consequent alternative policies implemented different countries high disease scare past led very high vaccine coverage consequent successful eradication smallpox well very low incidence measles polio tetanus diphtheria etc resulting over percent mortality reduction vaccine preventable diseases developed countries citation
MISC--: recent years after complete almost complete elimination diseases debate shifting towards issues vaccine safety
MISC--: increased perception vaccine risks lowered perception disease risks challenged previous willingness vaccinate citation
MISC--: this scenario understanding predicting individual s willingness vaccinate paramount estimating vaccine coverage compare strategies achieve coverage goals
MISC--: willingness vaccinate highly dependent perceived risk acquiring serious disease citation
MISC--: when disease risk low however small risk adverse events vaccine become relatively important may lead vaccine coverage lower than required control transmission citation
MISC--: when serious disease risk too high other hand vaccine coverage may increase above required guarantee population protection citation
OWNX--: we illustrate behaviors two examples
MISC--: uk mmr vaccine uptake started decline after controversial study linking mmr vaccine autism citation
OWNX--: decade vaccine coverage went well below target herd immunity level percent
MISC--: despite confidence researchers most health professionals vaccine safety confidence public was deeply affected
OWNX--: attempt find ways restore this confidence several studies were carried out identify factors associated parent s unwillingness vaccinate their children
MISC--: they found not receiving unbiased adequate information health professionals about vaccine safety media s adverse publicity were most common reasons influencing uptake citation
MISC--: other important factors were lack belief information government sources fear general practitioners promoting vaccine personal reasons media scare
OWNX--: note during this period risk acquiring measles was very low due previously high vaccination coverage
