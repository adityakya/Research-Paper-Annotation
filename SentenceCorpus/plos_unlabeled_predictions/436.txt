MISC--: selective attention important filter complex environments where distractions compete signals
OWNX--: attention increases both gamma band power cortical local field potentials spike field coherence within receptive field attended object
OWNX--: however mechanisms gamma band activity enhances if at all encoding input signals not well understood
OWNX--: we propose gamma oscillations induce binomial like spike count statistics across noisy neural populations
AIMX--: using simplified models spiking neurons we show how discrimination static signals based population spike count response improved gamma induced binomial statistics
OWNX--: results give important mechanistic link between neural correlates attention discrimination tasks where attention known enhance performance
OWNX--: further they show how rhythmicity spike responses enhance coding schemes not temporally sensitive
MISC--: past work both human animal subjects focused neural correlates attention
MISC--: attention raises firing rate input output gain orientation selective neurons visual cortex citation citation shifts response curves so physiologically relevant stimuli fall high gain region citation citation
MISC--: also when attended stimuli overlap recorded receptive field gamma band frequency components local field potentials single unit spike responses increase citation citation
MISC--: gamma oscillations field potential likely reflect correlated network activity citation citation supported simulations spiking neurons inhibitory recurrent excitatory inhibitory coupling citation
MISC--: attention thought influence cholingergic neuromodulation citation presumably affects synchrony interneuron networks involved gamma oscillations citation citation citation
MISC--: well known correlated network discharge effectively drives postsynaptic cells citation making gamma band activity signature efficient signal propagation
OWNX--: this would allow attended objects increase downstream responses compared nonattended objects
OWNX--: contrast we assess role gamma oscillations signal coding neural populations participating gamma oscillatory dynamics
MISC--: tasks where attention improves performance typically involve discrimination between different signals visual cues different colors shapes orientations citation citation citation
MISC--: although there large number studies exploring how gamma rhythms generated networks spiking neurons mechanisms gamma oscillations modify signal discrimination elusive three aspects
MISC--: first relation between gain modulation gamma oscillations both attention dependent unclear
MISC--: second temporal relation between network gamma rhythm time course driving signal often unclear
MISC--: third gamma induced synchronous firing may deleterious coding due increased variability population activity citation
OWNX--: popular framework neural coding number spikes produced single neuron population neurons carries information about driving signal
MISC--: however vivo spike trains often show spike count fano factor close even exceeds unity citation citation
MISC--: this trial trial variability deleterious code performance degrades putative spike count based signal discrimination schemes
MISC--: certain situations fano factors much less than observed visual cortex citation citation auditory cortex citation salamander retina citation
MISC--: extreme case if neuron fires high probability response relevant input signal rarely fires otherwise citation then signal estimated spike count small error
MISC--: addition spike timing reliability neuron robustly emits just single spike during steep upstroke input seldom fires elsewhere citation citation also supportive binary spiking
OWNX--: this study we model essence gamma frequency modulation simple rhythmic forcing population uncoupled spiking neurons
OWNX--: we show gamma oscillations endow population spike counts binomial like statistics improve signal discrimination over range stimuli through reduced spike count variability
OWNX--: this way we propose connection between gamma oscillations enhanced task performance found behavioral experiments
