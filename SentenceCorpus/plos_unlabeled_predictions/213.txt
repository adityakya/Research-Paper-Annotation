MISC--: conventional evolutionary game theory predicts natural selection favours selfish strong even though cooperative interactions thrive at all levels organization living systems
MISC--: recent investigations demonstrated limiting factor evolution cooperative interactions way they organized cooperators becoming evolutionarily competitive whenever individuals constrained interact few others along edges networks low average connectivity
OWNX--: despite this insight conundrum cooperation remains since recent empirical data shows real networks exhibit typically high average connectivity associated single broad scale heterogeneity
MISC--: here computational model constructed individuals able self organize both their strategy their social ties throughout evolution based exclusively their self interest
AIMX--: we show entangled evolution individual strategy network structure constitutes key mechanism sustainability cooperation social networks
MISC--: given average connectivity population there critical value ratio w between time scales associated evolution strategy structure above cooperators wipe out defectors
MISC--: moreover emerging social networks exhibit overall heterogeneity accounts very well diversity patterns recently found acquired data social networks
MISC--: finally heterogeneity found become maximal when w reaches its critical value
OWNX--: results show simple topological dynamics reflecting individual capacity self organization social ties produce realistic networks high average connectivity associated single broad scale heterogeneity
MISC--: other hand they show cooperation cannot evolve result social viscosity alone heterogeneous networks high average connectivity requiring additional mechanism topological co evolution ensure survival cooperative behaviour
MISC--: conventional evolutionary game theory predicts natural selection favours selfish strong citation spite existing evidence showing cooperation more widespread than theory predicts citation
MISC--: when cooperation modelled terms prisoner s dilemma citation solution replicator dynamics equation infinite well mixed populations citation citation dictates extinction cooperators defectors
MISC--: cooperators become evolutionarily competitive however whenever individuals constrained interact few others along edges sparse graphs recently concluded two independent studies citation citation
MISC--: both studies place individuals nodes static graph associate their social ties vertices linking nodes throughout evolution every individual possibility changing her strategy but not her social ties
MISC--: citation been shown under strong selection heterogeneous graphs lead significant increase overall survivability cooperation modelled terms most popular social dilemmas played networks different degrees heterogeneity citation
MISC--: classical pd act cooperation involves cost c provider resulting benefit b recipient simple relation been obtained citation single cooperator chance survive population defectors whenever selection weak b c z where z stands average number ties each individual
MISC--: both studies show games graphs open window emergence cooperation showing how social viscosity alone citation contribute emergence cooperation
MISC--: however recent data shows realistic networks citation citation exhibit average connectivity values ranging associated heterogeneity intermediate between single scale broad scale citation differs connectivity values typically used previous studies citation citation
MISC--: instance network movie actors exhibits average connectivity citation whereas collaboration networks based co authorship published papers vary average values up citation
MISC--: terms simple rule evolution cooperation graphs reported values z require benefits often exceed costs more than one order magnitude single cooperator survive citation
MISC--: none previous results strong citation weak citation selection graphs capable explaining how cooperation thrives social networks
MISC--: other mechanisms at work here allow survival cooperation
MISC--: most evolutionary models developed so far social interactions fixed outset
MISC--: immutable social ties associated naturally static graphs imply individuals no control over number frequency duration their ties they only evolve their behavioural strategy
MISC--: similar observation made studies related physical properties complex networks citation citation
MISC--: analyzed networks constitute but one static snapshot networks been typically produced some growth process
MISC--: yet networks naturally evolved before will continue evolve after snapshot been taken
MISC--: indeed recent longitudinal studies evolving social networks citation indicate global properties seem remain rather stable whereas individual patterns social ties remain evolving time
MISC--: hence assuming fixed population size global average connectivity one may ask what role do changes interaction framework play evolution cooperation extent will social dilemmas influence topology heterogeneity evolving network
OWNX--: using minimal model combines strategy evolution topological evolution requirements individual cognitive capacities very small we investigate under conditions cooperation may thrive
MISC--: network heterogeneity now emerges result entangled co evolutionary dynamics will shown play crucial role facilitating cooperative behaviour
MISC--: let us consider two types individuals cooperators defectors who engage several most popular social dilemmas cooperation
MISC--: they not required accumulate information all other players only those they immediately connected
MISC--: moreover they able decide equal footing all players those ties they want maintain those they want change
OWNX--: given edge individuals b at extremes we say satisfied edge if strategy b cooperator being dissatisfied otherwise
MISC--: if satisfied she will decide maintain link
MISC--: if dissatisfied then she may compete b rewire link rewiring being attempted random neighbour b intuition behind this reasoning following simple agents being rational individuals limited information tend interact other agents close social manner citation
MISC--: this sense agent more likely encounter one friends b become friend b s neighbour
MISC--: moreover selecting neighbour inconvenient partner may turn out good choice since this partner also tries establish links cooperators making more likely rewiring results tie cooperator
MISC--: indeed all social dilemmas described below link cooperator maximizes fitness any individual irrespective its strategy
OWNX--: consequently all individuals naturally seek establish links cooperators
MISC--: hence rewiring neighbour defector certainly good choice individuals local information only
MISC--: social dilemmas cooperation examined this work modelled terms symmetric two player games where players either cooperate defect upon interaction
MISC--: when both cooperate they receive payoff r other hand when both defect they both obtain payoff p two remaining possibilities occur when one defects other cooperates resulting payoff t defector s cooperator
OWNX--: depending relative ordering four payoff values assuming mutual cooperation preferred over mutual defection three well known social dilemmas emerge citation snowdrift game stag hunt game prisoner s dilemma
MISC--: dilemma follows players payoff preferences
MISC--: sg game players referred greedy since they prefer unilateral defection mutual cooperation
OWNX--: sh game mutual defection preferred unilateral cooperation resulting intrinsic fear players cooperate
CONT--: finally both dilemmas combined pd game making most difficult situation cooperation arise
OWNX--: we adopt convention citation normalize difference between mutual cooperation mutual defection making r p respectively
OWNX--: consequence we investigate all dilemmas summarized table d parameter space depicted figure where payoff t satisfies t payoff s satisfies s
MISC--: fitness each individual corresponds total accumulated payoff resulting pairwise interactions all her neighbours
AIMX--: fact our model cooperators defectors interact via social ties they both decide upon establishes coupling between individual strategy population structure game payoff induces now entangled co evolution strategy structure
CONT--: adaptive individual behaviour introduces new time scale not necessarily equal time scale associated strategy evolution
MISC--: depending ratio w e different fates may occur cooperation
OWNX--: indeed whenever w we recover results citation citation
MISC--: other hand increasing w individuals become apt adapt their ties increasing efficiency
MISC--: general however one expects two time scales comparable magnitude realistic situations
OWNX--: w provides measure individuals inertia react their rational choices both at strategy topological levels large values w reflect populations individuals react promptly adverse ties whereas smaller values reflect some overall inertia topological change
MISC--: general type response will change individual individual
MISC--: hence w reflects here average characteristic population
