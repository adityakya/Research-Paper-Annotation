OWNX--: we study evolution cooperation under indirect reciprocity believed constitute biological basis morality
OWNX--: we employ evolutionary game theoretical model multilevel selection show natural selection mutation lead emergence robust simple social norm we call stern judging
MISC--: under stern judging helping good individual refusing help bad individual leads good reputation whereas refusing help good individual helping bad one leads bad reputation
MISC--: similarly tit tat win stay lose shift simplest ubiquitous strategies direct reciprocity lack ambiguity stern judging where implacable punishment compensated prompt forgiving supports idea simplicity often associated evolutionary success
MISC--: many biological systems employ cooperative interactions their organization citation
MISC--: humans unlike other animal species form large social groups cooperation among non kin widespread
MISC--: this contrasts general assumption strong selfish individuals ones who benefit most natural selection
OWNX--: this being case how possible unselfish behaviour survived evolution
MISC--: adopting terminology resulting seminal work hamilton trivers wilson citation citation act altruistic if confers benefit b another individual spite accruing cost c altruist
MISC--: this context several mechanisms been invoked explain evolution altruism but only recently evolutionary model indirect reciprocity been developed nowak sigmund citation remarkable simplicity addressed unique aspects human sociality trust gossip reputation citation
MISC--: means community enforcement indirect reciprocity had been investigated earlier context economics notably sugden citation kandori citation
MISC--: more recently many studies citation citation citation citation been devoted investigating how altruism evolve under indirect reciprocity
MISC--: indeed according alexander citation indirect reciprocity presumably provides mechanism distinguishes us humans all other living species earth
MISC--: moreover recently argued citation indirect reciprocity may provided selective challenge driving cerebral expansion human evolution
MISC--: indirect reciprocity game any two players supposed interact at most once each other one role potential donor other potential receiver help
MISC--: each player experience many rounds but never same partner twice direct retaliation being unfeasible
MISC--: helping another individual given player may increase her reputation may change predisposition others help her future interactions
OWNX--: however her new reputation depends social norm used her peers assess her action donor
MISC--: previous studies reputation based models cooperation reviewed recently citation indicate cooperation outweighs defection whenever among other factors assessment actions based norms require considerable cognitive capacities citation citation citation even when individuals capable making binary assessments only world black white citation assumed most recent studies
MISC--: furthermore stable cooperation hinges availability reliable reputation information citation
MISC--: high cognitive capacity contrasts technology based interactions e trade also rely reputation based mechanisms cooperation citation citation
MISC--: indeed anonymous one shot interactions between individuals loosely connected geographically dispersed usually dominate e trade raising issues trust building moral hazard citation
MISC--: reputation e trade introduced via feedback mechanism announces ratings sellers
OWNX--: despite success high levels cooperation observed e trade been found citation publicizing detailed account seller s feedback history does not improve cooperation compared publicizing only seller s most recent rating
OWNX--: other words practice shows simple reputation based mechanisms capable promoting high levels cooperation
OWNX--: view previous discussion hard explain success e trade basis results obtained so far reputation based cooperation context indirect reciprocity
MISC--: let us consider world black white consisting set tribes each tribe lives under influence single norm common all individuals
MISC--: each individual engages once indirect reciprocity game all other tribe inhabitants
MISC--: her action donor will depend her individual strategy dictates whether she will provide help refuse do depending her recipient s reputation
MISC--: reputations public this means result every interaction made available everyone through indirect observation model introduced citation
MISC--: this allows any individual know current status co player without observing all her past interactions
MISC--: other hand this requires way spread information entire population
MISC--: consistently language seems important cooperation promoter citation although recent mechanisms reputation spreading rely electronic databases
MISC--: since reputations either good bad there possible strategies
MISC--: other hand number possible norms depends their associated order
OWNX--: simplest so called first order norms all matters action taken donor
MISC--: second order norms reputation one players also contributes decide new reputation donor
MISC--: so increasing layers complexity shown figure illustrates features third order norms those we shall employ here
MISC--: any individual tribe shares same norm turn raises question how each inhabitant acquired
OWNX--: we do not address this issue here
MISC--: however inasmuch indirect reciprocity associated community enforcement citation citation one may assume simplicity norms acquired through educational process
MISC--: moreover likely common norm contributes overall cohesiveness identity tribe
MISC--: noteworthy however if norms were different different individuals indirect observation model would not valid requires trust judgments made co inhabitants
AIMX--: norm order n there possible norms each associated binary string length n we consider third order norms assessing donor s new reputation observer make contextual judgment involving donor s action well her recipient s reputations scored previous action
OWNX--: we introduce following evolutionary dynamics each tribe during one generation all individuals interact once each other via indirect reciprocity game
MISC--: when individuals reproduce they replace their strategy another individual same tribe chosen proportional her accumulated payoff citation
MISC--: most successful individuals each tribe higher reproductive success
MISC--: since different tribes under influence different norms overall fitness each tribe will vary tribe tribe well plethora successful strategies thrive each tribe
MISC--: this describes individual selection each tribe
MISC--: tribes engage pairwise conflicts small probability associated selection between tribes
OWNX--: after each conflict norm defeated tribe will change toward norm victor tribe detailed methods section
MISC--: we consider different forms conflict between tribes reflect different types inter tribe selection mechanisms group selection citation citation citation based average global payoff each tribe well selection resulting inter tribe conflicts modeled terms games display game war attrition extended hawk dove game citation
OWNX--: we perform extensive computer simulations evolutionary dynamics sets tribes each inhabitants
MISC--: once stationary regime reached we collect information subsequent statistical analysis
OWNX--: we compute frequency occurrence bits each bit locations
MISC--: bit said fixate if its frequency occurrence exceeds equals percent
OWNX--: otherwise no fixation occurs we denote x instead
MISC--: we analyze simulations same value b subsequently computing frequency occurrence x bits x respectively
MISC--: if x final bit if x final bit otherwise we assume indeterminate denote
OWNX--: noteworthy our bit bit selection transmission procedure though artificial provides simple means mimicking biological evolution where genes interconnected complex networks yet evolve independently
MISC--: certainly co evolutionary process would more appropriate this will explored future work
