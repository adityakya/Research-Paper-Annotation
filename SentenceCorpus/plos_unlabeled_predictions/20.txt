MISC--: central problem bioinformatics gene regulation find binding sites regulatory proteins
MISC--: one most promising approaches toward identifying short fuzzy sequence patterns comparative analysis orthologous intergenic regions related species
MISC--: this analysis complicated various factors
MISC--: first one needs take phylogenetic relationship between species into account order distinguish conservation due occurrence functional sites spurious conservation due evolutionary proximity
MISC--: second one deal complexities multiple alignments orthologous intergenic regions one consider possibility functional sites may occur outside conserved segments
AIMX--: here we present new motif sampling algorithm phylogibbs runs arbitrary collections multiple local sequence alignments orthologous sequences
MISC--: algorithm searches over all ways arbitrary number binding sites arbitrary number transcription factors assigned multiple sequence alignments
MISC--: binding site configurations scored bayesian probabilistic model treats aligned sequences model evolution binding sites background intergenic dna
MISC--: this model takes phylogenetic relationship between species alignment explicitly into account
OWNX--: algorithm uses simulated annealing monte carlo markov chain sampling rigorously assign posterior probabilities all binding sites reports
MISC--: tests synthetic data real data five saccharomyces species our algorithm performs significantly better than four other motif finding algorithms including algorithms also take phylogeny into account
OWNX--: our results also show contrast other algorithms phylogibbs make realistic estimates reliability its predictions
OWNX--: our tests suggest running five species multiple alignment single gene s upstream region phylogibbs average recovers over percent all binding sites s cerevisiae at specificity about percent percent all binding sites at specificity about percent
OWNX--: we also tested phylogibbs collections multiple alignments intergenic regions were recently annotated based chip chip data contain binding sites same tf
OWNX--: we compared phylogibbs s results previous analysis data using six other motif finding algorithms
MISC--: tfs all other motif finding methods failed find significant motif phylogibbs did recover motif matches literature consensus
OWNX--: cases where there was disagreement results we compiled lists known target genes literature found running phylogibbs their regulatory regions yielded binding motif matching literature consensus all but one cases
MISC--: interestingly literature gene lists had little overlap targets annotated based chip chip data
MISC--: phylogibbs code downloaded link link
OWNX--: full set predicted sites our tests yeast available at link
MISC--: transcription factors proteins bind sequence specific manner short dna segments most commonly intergenic dna upstream gene activate suppress gene transcription
MISC--: their dna binding domains recognize collections short related dna sequences
MISC--: one generally finds although there no unique combination bases shared all binding sites although different bases occur at each position there clear biases distribution bases occur at each position binding sites
MISC--: common mathematical representation motif takes this variability into account so called weight matrix citation citation w whose components w i give probabilities finding base c g t at position i binding site
MISC--: main assumption underlying this mathematical representation bases occurring at different positions binding site probabilistically independent
MISC--: this turn follows under some conditions citation assumption binding energy protein dna sum pairwise contact energies between individual nucleotides protein
MISC--: there several algorithms based wm representation detect ab initio binding sites common tf collection dna sequences citation citation
MISC--: algorithms broadly fall into two classes
OWNX--: one class meme citation typical representative searches space all wms wm best explain observed sequences
MISC--: class gibbs sampling algorithms gibbs motif sampler citation citation typical representative instead samples space all multiple alignments small sequence segments search one most likely consist samples common wm
MISC--: crucial factor success ab initio methods ratio number binding sites total amount dna collection sequences
MISC--: larger number binding sites set smaller total amount dna more likely ab initio methods discover binding sites among other dna sequences
MISC--: order ensure reasonable chance success one thus needs provide methods collections sequences highly enriched binding sites common tf
OWNX--: one possibility use sets upstream regions genes appear co regulated microarray experiments were bound common tf chip chip experiments
MISC--: another possibility use upstream regions orthologous genes related organisms
MISC--: here assumption regulation ancestor gene thus its binding sites been conserved orthologs descend
CONT--: this latter approach general complicated number factors
MISC--: when searching regulatory sites sequences not phylogenetically related upstream regions different genes same organism one may simply look short sequence motifs overrepresented among input sequences
MISC--: if set species orthologous sequences derive sufficiently diverged one may simply choose ignore phylogenetic relationship between sequences treat orthologous sequences same way sequences not phylogenetically related
MISC--: this was instance approach taken mccue et al citation citation where gibbs motif sampler algorithm citation citation was used upstream regions proteo bacteria
CONT--: however this approach not applicable datasets containing more closely related species where some sequences will exhibit significant amounts similarity simply because their evolutionary proximity
MISC--: moreover amount similarity will depend phylogenetic distance between species clear finding conserved sequence motifs between orthologous sequences closely related species much less indicative function than finding sequence motifs conserved between distant species
MISC--: one will general thus distinguish conservation due functional constraints conservation due evolutionary proximity do this correctly phylogenetic relationship between sequences taken into account
MISC--: second challenge using orthologous intergenic sequences multiple species nontrivial structure their multiple alignments
MISC--: one typically finds very heterogeneous pattern conservation well conserved blocks different sizes covering different subsets species interspersed sequence segments show little similarity sequences other species
MISC--: technique phylogenetic footprinting restricts attention only those sequence segments genome interest show significant conservation other species
MISC--: conserved regions multiple genes then searched common motifs variety techniques
CONT--: unclear however what extent regulatory sites restricted conserved segments
MISC--: instance several studies drosophila yeast citation citation shown there no strong correlation between where experimentally annotated binding sites occur whether region conserved
MISC--: thus at least yeast flies considerable information lost focusing conserved regions only
OWNX--: we thus decided retain entire patchwork pattern conserved sequence blocks unaligned segments
OWNX--: our strategy implemented gibbs sampling approach preliminary account algorithm was presented citation
BASE--: algorithm operates arbitrary collections both phylogenetically related sequences orthologous intergenic regions sequences not phylogenetically related upstream regions different genes same organism
MISC--: phylogenetically related groups sequences input pre aligned into local multiple alignments where clearly similar sequence segments aligned into blocks sequence segments no marginal similarity left unaligned citation
OWNX--: although algorithm also take global multiple alignments input we believe often force phylogenetically unrelated segments into aligned blocks
CONT--: this may adversely affect performance algorithm
OWNX--: we score putative sites within blocks aligned sequences evolutionary model takes phylogenetic relationships species into account while putative sites unaligned segments treated independent occurrences
OWNX--: this bayesian model defines probability distribution over arbitrary placements putative binding sites multiple motifs we sample monte carlo markov chain
OWNX--: we first use simulated annealing search globally optimal configuration binding sites
OWNX--: motifs this configuration then tracked further sampling run estimate realistic posterior probabilities all binding sites algorithm reports
MISC--: recently number other algorithms been developed search regulatory motifs groups phylogenetically related sequences
OWNX--: probably first algorithm was proposed generalization consensus algorithm citation called phylocon citation
MISC--: phylocon operates sets co regulated genes their orthologs
MISC--: greedy algorithm first finds ungapped alignments similar sequence segments sets orthologous sequences then combines alignments different upstream regions into larger alignments
MISC--: this algorithm does not take any phylogenetic information into account i e closely related sequences treated same distantly related sequences
OWNX--: other drawbacks this algorithm assumes each motif will exactly one site each intergenic regions assumes this site conserved all orthologs
MISC--: more closely related phylogibbs s approach two recent algorithms citation citation generalize meme citation take phylogenetic relationships between species into account
MISC--: main difference between emnem phyme phyme uses same evolutionary model evolution binding sites phylogibbs takes into account binding sites evolve under constraints set wm whereas emnem simply assumes overall slower rate evolution binding sites than background sequences
MISC--: another difference phyme like phylogibbs treats multiple alignment more flexibly than emnem demands global multiple alignment
CONT--: main difference between phylogibbs algorithms course phylogibbs takes motif sampling approach allows us search multiple motifs parallel whereas phyme emnem use expectation maximization search one wm at time
OWNX--: following sections we first describe our bayesian model assigns posterior probability each configuration binding sites multiple motifs assigned input sequences
BASE--: we start describing model phylogenetically unrelated sequences essentially equivalent model used gibbs motif sampler citation citation then describe how this model extended datasets contain phylogenetically related sequences
OWNX--: after we describe move set we search state space all possible configurations annealing tracking strategy we use identify significant groups sites
OWNX--: we then present examples performance ours other algorithms both synthetic real data
OWNX--: synthetic datasets consist mixtures wm samples random sequences accordance assumptions all algorithms make
OWNX--: this allows us compare performance algorithms idealized situation does not contain complexities real data
OWNX--: tests also show what extent binding sites recovered this idealized data function quality wms number sites available number species available their phylogenetic distances
BASE--: our tests real data we use upstream regions saccharomyces cerevisiae known binding sites collection citation compare ability different algorithms recover sites when running multiple alignments orthologs upstream regions recently sequenced saccharomyces genomes citation citation
OWNX--: finally we run phylogibbs collections upstream region alignments were annotated citation contain binding sites common tf based data chip chip experiments we extensively compare phylogibbs results annotations citation literature
