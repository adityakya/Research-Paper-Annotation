MISC--: evolution shaping world around us
MISC--: at core every evolutionary process population reproducing individuals
MISC--: outcome evolutionary process depends population structure
MISC--: here we provide general formula calculating evolutionary dynamics wide class structured populations
MISC--: this class includes recently introduced games phenotype space evolutionary set theory
MISC--: there local interactions determining relative fitness individuals but we require global updating means all individuals compete uniformly reproduction
OWNX--: we study competition two strategies context evolutionary game determine strategy favored limit weak selection
OWNX--: we derive intuitive formula structure coefficient provide method efficient numerical calculation
MISC--: constant selection implies fitness individuals does not depend composition population
MISC--: general however success individuals affected what others doing
BASE--: then we realm game theory citation citation evolutionary game theory citation citation
MISC--: latter study frequency dependent selection fitness individuals typically assumed linear function frequencies strategies population
MISC--: population trying adapt dynamic fitness landscape changes fitness landscape caused population moves over citation
MISC--: there also close relationship between evolutionary game theory ecology citation success species ecosystem depends its own abundance abundance other species
MISC--: classical approach evolutionary game dynamics based deterministic differential equations describing infinitely large well mixed populations citation citation
MISC--: well mixed population any two individuals interact equally likely
MISC--: some recent approaches consider stochastic evolutionary dynamics populations finite size citation citation
MISC--: evolutionary game dynamics also affected population structure citation citation
MISC--: example well mixed population typically opposes evolution cooperation while structured population promote
MISC--: there also long standing tradition studying spatial models ecology citation citation population genetics citation citation inclusive fitness theory citation citation
MISC--: evolutionary graph theory extension spatial games normally studied regular lattices general graphs citation citation
MISC--: graph determines who meets whom reflects physical structure social networks
MISC--: payoff individuals derived local interactions their neighbors graph
MISC--: moreover individuals compete locally their neighbors reproduction
MISC--: two processes also described separate graphs citation
MISC--: games phenotype space citation represent another type spatial model evolutionary dynamics motivated idea tag based cooperation citation citation
MISC--: addition behavioral strategies individuals express other phenotypic features serve markers identification
MISC--: one version model individuals interact only those who carry same phenotypic marker
MISC--: this approach lead clustering phenotype space promote evolution cooperation citation
MISC--: evolutionary set theory represents another type spatial model citation
MISC--: each individual belong several sets
MISC--: at particular time some sets many members while others empty
MISC--: individuals interact others same set thereby derive payoff
MISC--: individuals update their set memberships strategies global comparison others
MISC--: successful strategies spawn imitators successful sets attract more members
MISC--: therefore population structure described ever changing dynamical graph
MISC--: evolutionary dynamics set structured populations favor cooperators over defectors
MISC--: all three frameworks evolutionary graph theory games phenotype space evolutionary set theory fitness individuals consequence local interactions
MISC--: evolutionary graph theory there also local update rule individuals learn their neighbors graph compete nearby individuals placing offspring
MISC--: evolutionary set theory however citation assumes global updating individuals learn all others population adopt their strategies set memberships
MISC--: global updating also feature model games phenotype space citation
AIMX--: approach presented this paper requires global updating
MISC--: therefore our result holds evolutionary set theory games phenotype space but does not apply evolutionary graph theory
