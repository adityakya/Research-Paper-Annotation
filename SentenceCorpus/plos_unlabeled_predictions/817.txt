MISC--: increasing number cis regulatory rna elements been found regulate gene expression post transcriptionally various biological processes bacterial systems
OWNX--: effective computational tools large scale identification novel regulatory rnas strongly desired facilitate our exploration gene regulation mechanisms regulatory networks
OWNX--: we present new computational program named rssvm employs support vector machines efficient identification functional rna motifs random rna secondary structures
MISC--: rssvm uses set distinctive features represent common rna secondary structure structural alignment predicted rna sampler tool accurate common rna secondary structure prediction trained functional rnas variety bacterial rna motif gene families covering wide range sequence identities
MISC--: when tested large number known random rna motifs rssvm shows significantly higher sensitivity than other leading rna identification programs while maintaining same false positive rate
MISC--: rssvm performs particularly well sets low sequence identities
MISC--: combination rna sampler rssvm provides new fast efficient pipeline large scale discovery regulatory rna motifs
OWNX--: we applied rssvm multiple shewanella genomes identified putative regulatory rna motifs untranslated regions s oneidensis important bacterial organism extraordinary respiratory metal reducing abilities great potential bioremediation alternative energy generation

OWNX--: rssvm software predictions analysis results shewanella genomes available at link
MISC--: rna remarkably versatile citation citation acting not only messengers transfer genetic information dna protein but also critical structural components citation catalytic enzymes citation citation cell
MISC--: more intriguingly non coding rnas been found play important regulatory roles
MISC--: they mediate gene expression post transcriptionally two ways one serve trans acting antisense rnas micrornas hybridize target mrnas silence their expression citation citation other form structural cis elements mrnas riboswitches regulate gene expression mediating transcription termination translation initiation citation citation
MISC--: regulatory roles ncrnas make them promising drug targets citation efficient tools drug development gene therapy citation citation
MISC--: past few years many cis regulatory rna structural motifs been identified prokaryotes citation citation
MISC--: they often located untranslated regions mrnas sense interact cognate factors including proteins rnas small metabolites even temperature changes mediate transcription attenuation citation translation initiation citation mrna stability citation
MISC--: functions regulatory rnas intrinsically tied their secondary structures mostly recognizable stem loops pseudoknots
OWNX--: moreover regulatory rnas often conserved during evolution similar regulatory rna elements shared multiple co regulated genes same metabolic pathway conserved orthologous genes across closely related species citation
MISC--: experimental screenings citation cis regulatory rnas highly labor time consuming
MISC--: demonstrated previous studies citation citation parallel way find good candidates computationally followed targeted experimental validation
OWNX--: because functional regulatory rnas often evolutionarily conserved their secondary structures we identify them finding significantly conserved rna secondary structures orthologous genes across closely related species
OWNX--: accomplish this we need two tools one accurately predict common rna secondary structures multiple related sequences other distinguish functional rna secondary structures random foldings rna sequences
MISC--: number algorithms been developed common rna secondary structure prediction rnaalifold citation dynalign citation comrna citation cmfinder citation foldalign citation citation
MISC--: we recently published new algorithm called rna sampler citation predicting common rna secondary structures structural alignments multiple sequences
MISC--: both our study citation independent studies other researchers citation citation demonstrated rna sampler provides more accurate structure predictions generates better structural alignments sequences wide range identities than other leading software similar purposes
MISC--: moreover rna sampler runs fast feasible common rna secondary structure prediction genome scale
MISC--: studies shown single sequence rna secondary structure alone not sufficient distinguish functional rna random sequence citation citation
OWNX--: however availability multiple rna sequences related species comparative genomics approaches provide additional power identify functional rna structures
MISC--: one strategy design scoring function predicted rna secondary structures examine difference between score distributions real structures randomly permutated structures employed rna identification pipeline based cmfinder citation comrna citation
MISC--: but one limitation approach user needs generate large number random sequence sets each set real sequences doing structure predictions permutated sequence sets usually time consuming
MISC--: besides difficult find score cutoff make call between functional random rnas
MISC--: another strategy train classification model based features distinguish common structures known functional rnas those random rnas then apply classification model newly predicted common rna structures determine whether they functional random rnas
MISC--: rna classification algorithms employing this strategy include qrna rnaz dynalign libsvm
MISC--: qrna citation classifies pairwise sequence alignment posterior probabilities three probabilistic models rna coding null
MISC--: rnaz citation dynalign libsvm citation both employ support vector machines build classification models
CONT--: train classification model developer still needs generate large number random sequence sets negative training sets make structure predictions them but once classification model trained user directly utilize model identify functional rnas without need generate perform folding random sequences
MISC--: type sequences used train classification models essential their classification performance new sequences
CONT--: qrna dynalign libsvm only use trnas rrnas their training rna structures rnaz trained multiple rna gene motif families rfam database but only uses sequence sets high identities
MISC--: avoid overfitting classification model specific classes rnas using training sets cover wide range sequence identities variety rna families more desirable
MISC--: addition training classification model using more accurately predicted rna common structures alignments advantageous more sensitive classification functional rnas random ones
MISC--: rnaz uses rnaalifold citation common rna structure prediction
MISC--: when using sequence alignments its input rnaalifold performs poorly predicting rna structures sequence sets low identities citation
CONT--: structure prediction accuracy rnaalifold may improved using structural alignments but rnaz might need re trained use structural alignments
AIMX--: this paper we present new svm based functional rna identifier named rssvm
MISC--: rssvm applies set features represent common rna secondary structures structural alignments generated rna sampler predicts rna structures more accurately than other approaches citation citation
MISC--: rssvm trained rna sets wide range sequence identities all bacterial rna motif gene families rfam database citation
