MISC--: transcription factor regulation often post translational
MISC--: tf modifications reversible phosphorylation missense mutations act independent tf expression level overlooked differential expression analysis
OWNX--: using bovine piedmontese myostatin mutants proof concept we propose new algorithm correctly identifies gene containing causal mutation microarray data alone
MISC--: myostatin mutation releases brakes piedmontese muscle growth translating dysfunctional protein
OWNX--: compared less muscular non mutant breed we find myostatin not differentially expressed at any ten developmental time points
OWNX--: despite this challenge algorithm identifies myostatin smoking gun through coordinated simultaneous weighted integration three sources microarray information transcript abundance differential expression differential wiring
MISC--: asking novel question regulator cumulatively most differentially wired abundant most differentially expressed genes
MISC--: yields correct answer myostatin
AIMX--: our new approach identifies causal regulatory changes globally contrasting co expression network dynamics
MISC--: entirely data driven weighting procedure emphasises regulatory movement relative phenotypically relevant part network
MISC--: contrast other published methods compare co expression networks significance testing not used eliminate connections
MISC--: evolution normal development immune responses aberrant processes diseases cancer all involve at least some rewiring regulatory circuits citation citation
MISC--: indeed subtle differences circuit wiring makes each individual unique
MISC--: key nodes regulatory circuits frequently transcription factors citation
MISC--: thus there great deal interest developing methods decoding tf changes
OWNX--: regulator target interactions assessed chip chip but this requires large amounts homogenous starting material tf specific reagents
MISC--: furthermore recruitment tf promoter does not necessarily correlate transcriptional status so biological interpretation complex citation
OWNX--: likely sites key regulatory mutations revealed whole genome scans but this approach requires large numbers individuals very dense snp panels
MISC--: even so exact causal gene may remain ambiguous if there several genes near marker
MISC--: any case little insight gained into underlying regulatory mechanisms
MISC--: order gain further insights into regulatory apparatus computational approaches continuously being proposed
MISC--: date they all operate integrating information multiple levels biological organisation particularly eqtl protein protein interaction tf binding site data citation citation
OWNX--: identifying regulatory change solely through contrasts gene expression data been elusive because tf tend stably expressed at baseline levels citation close sensitivity standard high throughput expression profiling platforms
OWNX--: further tf activation often regulated post translationally thereby act somewhat independently expression level
MISC--: biologically important common tf activation processes poorly detected conventional differential expression analysis
CONT--: we hypothesised system wide network approach might utility grounds while differentially regulated tf might not de between two systems its new position network perturbed system might allow detection smoking gun
MISC--: allow reliable evaluation hypothesis well defined experimental model system required
MISC--: piedmontese cattle double muscled because they possess genomic dna mutation myostatin mrna transcript citation
MISC--: resulting dysfunctional myostatin protein transcriptional regulator releases brakes muscle growth reflecting importance tgf signalling pathways determination final muscle mass fibre composition citation citation
MISC--: preliminary analysis expression myostatin piedmontese hereford versus wagyu hereford animals found de myostatin was not detectable using cdna based expression microarrays citation citation
OWNX--: thus we system we know identity gene containing causal mutation myostatin but we cannot identify de mrna muscle samples
OWNX--: contrasting muscle transcriptomes piedmontese wagyu crosses across developmental time points our aim was establish question myostatin answer
OWNX--: other words what question do we need ask gene expression data reveal identity transcriptional regulator containing causal mutation
