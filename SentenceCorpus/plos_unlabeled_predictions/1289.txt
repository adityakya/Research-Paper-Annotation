MISC--: knowledge social contact patterns still represents most critical step understanding spread directly transmitted infections
MISC--: data social contact patterns however expensive obtain
MISC--: major issue then whether simulation synthetic societies might helpful reliably reconstruct data
AIMX--: this paper we compute variety synthetic age specific contact matrices through simulation simple individual based model
CONT--: model informed italian time use data routine socio demographic data
MISC--: model named little italy because each artificial agent clone real person
MISC--: other words each agent s daily diary one observed corresponding real individual sampled italian time use survey
OWNX--: we also generated contact matrices socio demographic model underlying italian ibm pandemic prediction
MISC--: synthetic matrices then validated against recently collected italian serological data varicella parvovirus
OWNX--: their performance fitting sero profiles compared other matrices available italy polymod matrix
MISC--: synthetic matrices show same qualitative features ones estimated sample surveys example strong assortativeness presence super sub diagonal stripes related contacts between parents children
MISC--: once validated against serological data little italy matrices fit worse than polymod one vzv but better than concurrent matrices b
OWNX--: this first occasion where synthetic contact matrices systematically compared real ones validated against epidemiological data
OWNX--: results suggest simple carefully designed synthetic matrices provide fruitful complementary approach questionnaire based matrices
MISC--: paper also supports idea depending transmissibility level infection either number different contacts repeated exposure may key factor transmission
MISC--: century after first contributions giving birth mathematical epidemiology after years fast growth since first public health oriented contributions citation citation infectious diseases modeling recently received further dramatic impulse pandemics threats
OWNX--: bio terrorism sars first fear potentially devastating pandemic avian flu then finally recent pandemic h n influenza all fostered development more more detailed predictive tools
MISC--: range traditional models network analysis highly detailed large scale individual based models citation citation
MISC--: ibm highly flexible tools policy makers they allow define intervention measures at finest possible levels
CONT--: first time pandemic model continental scale been proposed citation
MISC--: critical aspect common all models parameterization social contact patterns i e how people socially mix each other citation
MISC--: social contact patterns key factors underlying transmission dynamics directly transmitted close contacts infectious diseases citation
MISC--: different models independently their level complexity geographical scale sensitive parameterization social contact patterns
MISC--: relatively simple case where individuals stratified age only contact patterns represented form contact matrices whose entries represent average number contacts individuals age group i individuals age group j per unit time
MISC--: until recently contact patterns were estimated indirectly calibrating suitably restricted contact matrices using observed epidemiological data serological case notifications data
MISC--: two major examples this indirect approach who acquires infection whom matrix citation proportionate preferred mixing approach citation
MISC--: approaches important restrictions population divided n age groups contact matrix contains nxn n unknown entries
OWNX--: therefore order estimate n parameters n data points some simplifying assumptions about structure matrix needed
MISC--: addition indirect approaches only estimate adequate contacts transmission rates i e composite parameters given product between contact rate corresponding risk infection per contact
MISC--: recently important progress been made this area through direct collection contact data means sample surveys citation citation
OWNX--: direct approach based appropriate definitions at risk event
MISC--: survey respondents then asked record diary relevant characteristics all individuals they had contact during randomly assigned day other factors location where contact occurred
MISC--: standardized international survey data social contact patterns european countries currently available citation
MISC--: addition contact matrices time contact matrices been estimated secondary data sources transportation surveys citation time use data citation increasingly available
MISC--: case time use data underlying hypothesis amount time people spend doing same activity same place relevant transmission disease
MISC--: drawback time use data they usually do not give direct information about number social contacts respondents time they spent contacts
MISC--: they only give marginal information time individuals allocated various daily activities citation
MISC--: therefore data need augmented other data assumptions produce reliable estimates contact matrices citation
MISC--: way supplement time use data relies socio demographic sources provide information size distribution arenas where contacts take place
MISC--: example school contacts we often know average class size average pupils teacher ratio all compulsory grades
OWNX--: contacts within household we information household size composition
MISC--: most other activities however there little information
MISC--: assumptions e g independency therefore necessary give some coarse ideas contact patterns citation
MISC--: however this approach ignores structure social networks where contacts formed
MISC--: promising approach then reconstruct networks simulation appropriate artificial social networks
MISC--: first example social network generated portland synthetic population citation
MISC--: case contact time contact matrices age products social dynamics portland model
OWNX--: matrices standard expected features population contacts cluster around children adult children interact most frequently other children close their own age etc however matrices were neither compared other contact matrices nor validated against empirical epidemiological data
OWNX--: thus no actual evaluation their goodness explaining transmission infections available
AIMX--: this paper we follow same line aim reconstruct contact time contacts matrices simulating suitable minimalistic socio demographic individual based model italy
CONT--: model parameterized integrating time use data italian time use survey citation other official socio demographic data citation citation
MISC--: model each artificial agent clone real individual i e there one one correspondence between diary each artificial agent one corresponding real survey participant
OWNX--: since sample representative italian population but size model population comparable small italian city we named model little italy
BASE--: this point view our model resembles portland model citation eemnes model citation
MISC--: little italy world agents physically displace during day order attend their various daily activities corresponding location
MISC--: locations agents contact other agents
MISC--: we defined contact having shared same physical environment during given time slot
BASE--: our approach we generate three different types contact matrices possibly informative distinct aspects biology transmission matrix describing time spent contact citation matrix counting number repetition contact episodes matrix counting contacts average number different persons contacted i e number different social partnerships citation
OWNX--: addition we extracted adequate citation contact matrix socio demographic model underlying italian ibm pandemic prediction mitigation citation we named big italy
MISC--: synthetic contact matrices computed simulation little big italy tested against recently collected italian serological data varicella parvovirus
CONT--: their performances compared other contact matrices available italy i e polymod time use matrices
