MISC--: spike timing precise auditory system been argued conveys information about auditory stimuli particular about location sound source
CONT--: however beyond simple time differences way neurons might extract this information unclear potential computational advantages unknown
MISC--: computational difficulty this task animal locate source unexpected sound two monaural signals highly dependent unknown source signal
MISC--: neuron models consisting spectro temporal filtering spiking nonlinearity we found binaural structure induced spatialized sounds mapped synchrony patterns depend source location rather than source signal
MISC--: location specific synchrony patterns would then result activation location specific assemblies postsynaptic neurons
OWNX--: we designed spiking neuron model exploited this principle locate variety sound sources virtual acoustic environment using measured human head related transfer functions
MISC--: model was able accurately estimate location previously unknown sounds both azimuth elevation known acoustic environment
OWNX--: we found multiple representations different acoustic environments could coexist sets overlapping neural assemblies could associated spatial locations hebbian learning
MISC--: model demonstrates computational relevance relative spike timing extract spatial information about sources independently source signal
MISC--: animals must able rapidly estimate location source unexpected sound example escape predator
OWNX--: this challenging task because acoustic signals at two ears vary both source signal acoustic environment information about source location must extracted independently other causes variability
MISC--: psychophysical studies shown source localization relies variety acoustic cues interaural time level differences spectral cues citation
MISC--: at neuronal level spike timing been shown convey information about auditory stimuli citation citation particular about source location citation citation
OWNX--: although well accepted itds extracted phase locked responses unknown how information beyond this could extracted spike timing neurons
MISC--: addition potential computational advantages spike timing code this task unclear
MISC--: sound s produced source propagates ears transformed presence head body pinnae possibly other aspects acoustic environment
OWNX--: results two linearly filtered signals f l s f r s at two ears where filtering depends relative position head source
MISC--: because two signals obtained same source signal binaural stimulus particular structure indicative source location
OWNX--: when signals transformed into spike trains we expect this structure transformed into synchrony patterns
OWNX--: therefore we examined synchrony patterns induced spatialized sounds neuron models consisting spectro temporal filtering spiking nonlinearity where binaural signals were obtained using variety sound sources filtered through measured human head related transfer functions
OWNX--: we then complemented model postsynaptic neurons responding both sides so synchrony patterns induced binaural structure resulted activation location specific assemblies neurons
OWNX--: model was able precisely encode source location activation neural assembly way was independent source signal
