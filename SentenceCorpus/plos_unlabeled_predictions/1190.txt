MISC--: risk maps estimating spatial distribution infectious diseases required guide public health policy local global scales
MISC--: advent model based geostatistics allowed maps generated formal statistical framework providing robust metrics map uncertainty enhances their utility decision makers
MISC--: many settings decision makers require spatially aggregated measures over large regions mean prevalence within country administrative region national populations living under different levels risk
MISC--: existing mbg mapping approaches provide suitable metrics local uncertainty fidelity predictions at each mapped pixel but not been adapted measuring uncertainty over large areas due largely series fundamental computational constraints
CONT--: here authors present new efficient approximating algorithm generate first time necessary joint simulation prevalence values across very large prediction spaces needed global scale mapping
OWNX--: this new approach implemented conjunction established model p falciparum allowing robust estimates mean prevalence at any specified level spatial aggregation
OWNX--: model used provide estimates national populations at risk under three policy relevant prevalence thresholds along accompanying model based measures uncertainty
AIMX--: overcoming previously unchallenged computational barriers this study illustrates how mbg approaches already at forefront infectious disease mapping extended provide large scale aggregate measures appropriate decision makers
MISC--: risk maps estimating spatial distribution infectious diseases relation underlying populations required support public health decision making at local global scales citation citation
MISC--: advancement theory increasing availability computation growing recognition importance robust handling uncertainty all contributed emergence recent years new paradigm mapping disease use special family generalised linear models known model based geostatistics generally implemented bayesian framework citation citation
MISC--: mbg models take point observations disease prevalence dispersed survey locations generate continuous maps interpolating prevalence at unsampled locations across raster grid surfaces
MISC--: most striking advantage mbg disease mapping its handling uncertainty
MISC--: interpolating sparse often imperfectly sampled survey data predict disease prevalence across wide regions results inherently uncertain risk maps level uncertainty varying spatially function density quality sample size available survey data moderated underlying spatial variability disease question
MISC--: mbg approaches allow sources uncertainty propagated final mapped output predicting probability distribution prevalence at each location interest
MISC--: where predictions made small uncertainty distributions will tightly concentrated around central value where uncertainty large they will more dispersed
MISC--: techniques been used generate robust informative risk maps malaria citation citation well range other infectious diseases citation citation at scales varying national global
MISC--: some studies extended handling variation through space also include temporal dimension allowing disease risk modelled quantified over time well space citation citation
MISC--: implementation mbg models over even relatively small areas extremely computationally expensive
MISC--: not only matrix algebra operations required generate predictions at each individual pixel costly compared simpler interpolation methods citation citation but this cost must multiplied many times because prediction uncertainty evaluated generating many equally probable realisations prevalence at each pixel
MISC--: implementations mbg disease models over large areas therefore tend via per pixel computation whereby complete maps built up generating predictive realisations each pixel independently
MISC--: this allows computational task broken down into many small more easily manageable operations
MISC--: approach yields appropriate measures local uncertainty set realisations each pixel represents posterior predictive distribution prevalence summary statistics mean inter quartile range percent credible intervals readily extracted providing user valid uncertainty information each individual location considered isolation
MISC--: there often need evaluate disease prevalence aggregated across spatial regions temporal periods combinations both citation citation
MISC--: this may quantify compare mean prevalence between countries administrative units example measure shift mean prevalence between start end intervention period policy change
MISC--: addition mbg prevalence models used estimate derived quantities population totals living regions at different levels risk burden disease cases expected within individual countries continents function underlying prevalence citation quantities definition exist only over aggregated space time units
CONT--: not possible however construct posterior distributions aggregate quantities using per pixel approach
MISC--: estimate mean region made up multiple pixels uncertainty around this estimate correlation between all pixels region must known
CONT--: per pixel approach each pixel modelled independent its neighbours ignoring any spatial temporal correlation
MISC--: failing account correlation between pixels leads gross underestimates uncertainty aggregated quantity especially over large regions citation
OWNX--: solution problem outlined above replace per pixel simulation prevalence realisations simultaneous joint simulation all pixels aggregated recreating appropriate spatial temporal correlation between them citation
OWNX--: crucially set pixel values then aggregated any way used input derived aggregated quantities realisations aggregations will appropriate posterior predictive distributions
MISC--: whilst conceptually simple extension local regional simulation induces fundamental computational constraint necessary calculations no longer disaggregated into separate tasks each pixel
MISC--: this constraint thus far prevented any use mbg disease mapping evaluation aggregate quantities over very large areas despite profound public health importance measures
MISC--: where examples joint simulation mbg disease mapping exist they tend either over very small spatial regions citation achieved simply breaking larger regions down manually into smaller more manageable tiles citation
AIMX--: this paper we use new approximate algorithm joint simulation quantify first time aggregated uncertainty over space time global scale mbg disease model plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence citation
OWNX--: we exemplify how this approach allows uncertainty prevalence predictions enumerated at continental national sub national scales at public health decisions usually made

MISC--: gaussian process take wide range forms central tendency at any location governed underlying mean function formula whilst textural properties governed covariance function formula
MISC--: symbol formula denotes set formula parameters define form covariance mean include covariate coefficients
OWNX--: mbg aim estimate joint posterior distribution model parameters formula values formula evaluated at all locations times prediction required generally across nodes regular raster grid
OWNX--: computationally this task split into two distinct phases
MISC--: firstly markov chain monte carlo used generate realisations joint posterior formula formula at only formula space time locations formula where data exist denoted formula
OWNX--: this intuitive because only at locations fit gaussian process evaluated this means mcmc must only consider multivariate normal distribution dimension formula generally several orders magnitude smaller than if all prediction locations across raster grid were considered

MISC--: this case largest single computational component population factorisation data data covariance matrix formula typical disease prevalence data sets where formula hundreds thousands relatively minor task could generally achieved standard desktop computer
MISC--: subsequent sampling posterior predictive distribution trivial posterior predictive mean covariance refer single prediction location sampling therefore amounts drawing univariate normal distribution
MISC--: total computation each pixel therefore modest cost generating maps grows simply proportion number pixels involved formula
MISC--: switching per pixel implementation joint simulation over many prediction locations increases profoundly computational challenge
MISC--: efficiency per pixel approach arises effective reduction formula one each pixel considered isolation
MISC--: joint simulation requires formula preserved total number prediction points many millions if large areas considered at reasonably fine spatial resolution
MISC--: addition formula formula data data covariance matrix formula formula prediction prediction formula formula data prediction covariance matrices must populated
MISC--: more importantly subsequent sampling posterior predictive multivariate normal distribution prediction prediction covariance matrix must factorised citation
MISC--: computational cost this operation proportional cube formula
MISC--: put this non linear scaling context if direct joint simulation raster grid could computed one minute grid would take approximately seconds
CONT--: practice scaling factors along those memory storage requirements mean direct joint simulation using equations outlined above generally limited predictions at maximum around points citation citation at least two orders magnitude too few global scale mapping at sub km resolution even at single time period
