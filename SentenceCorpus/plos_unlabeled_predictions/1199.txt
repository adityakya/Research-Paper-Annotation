OWNX--: apparent occupancy levels proteins bound dna vivo now routinely measured genomic scale
MISC--: challenge relating occupancy levels assembly mechanisms defined biochemically isolated components lies veracity assumptions made regarding vivo system
MISC--: assumptions regarding behavior molecules vivo neither proven true nor false thus necessarily subjective
MISC--: nevertheless within those confines connecting vivo protein dna interaction observations defined biochemical mechanisms important step towards fully defining understanding assembly disassembly mechanisms vivo
OWNX--: this end we developed computational program pathcom models vivo protein dna occupancy data biochemical mechanisms under assumption occupancy levels related binding duration explicitly defined assembly disassembly reactions
OWNX--: we exemplify process assembly general transcription factors at genes budding yeast saccharomyces
OWNX--: within assumption inherent system our modeling suggests tbp occupancy at promoters rather transient compared other general factors despite importance tbp nucleating assembly preinitiation complex
MISC--: pathcom suitable modeling any assembly disassembly pathway given all proteins come together form complex
MISC--: eukaryotic genes thought regulated hundreds proteins assemble into pre initiation complexes at promoters using ordered pathway
MISC--: one aspect pic assembly pathway involves recruitment general transcription factors tbp tfiib sequence specific activators
MISC--: tbp tfiib then contribute recruitment rna polymerase ii other gtf s eventually start transcription
OWNX--: fundamental question concerning our understanding gene regulation extent each assembly disassembly step distinct at every gene genome
MISC--: traditional biochemical view tbp locks commits promoter recurring manner nucleates pic formation valid vivo
MISC--: pic disassembly process vivo simply reverse assembly process
MISC--: parts assembly disassembly pathway been rigorously defined vitro few purified proteins dna this provided us our current parsimonious view pic regulation citation citation citation citation
MISC--: no case assembly disassembly reactions been reconstituted way fully recapitulates physiological setting at every gene so questions remain open regards extent vitro defined reactions mimic vivo events occurring throughout genome
MISC--: answer this question not readily addressed vivo since reactions not definable nor quantifiable vitro biochemical reactions purified components
MISC--: nonetheless assays do exist measuring relative levels protein dna complex formation vivo so mechanistic inferences will sought
MISC--: goal here evaluate vivo occupancy data light biochemical mechanisms intended reflect corresponding vivo reaction
MISC--: extent biological insight predicated rather subjective assessments assumptions associated interpretation vivo data
OWNX--: within context declared constraints assumptions we propose means model vivo protein dna occupancy data so better integrate conceptualize massive genomic datasets
OWNX--: this study focused means modeling assumptions inherent data using specific examples pic assembly
OWNX--: currently perhaps most widely used assay measure occupancy proteins at genes vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
MISC--: chip proteins crosslinked dna protein then purified bound dna identified either through directed pcr through genome wide detection platforms
MISC--: this way example relative occupancy level tbp tfiib pol ii many other proteins at every promoter genome population cells assayed
MISC--: recent studies using differential chip photobleaching experiments provided compelling evidence dynamic state pic components living cells citation citation citation
MISC--: therefore now within conceptual framework expect factors like rna polymerase ii tbp other gtfs undergo multiple assembly disassembly cycles at promoters each productive transcription event rather than traditional simple view gtf s remain locked place during multiple transcription cycles
OWNX--: existence origins distinct occupancy levels pic components genes not been systematically explored thus impetus conducting modeling studies described here
MISC--: differential occupancy patterns gtfs been described citation may caused gene specific regulators influence recruitment retention specific general transcription factors thus assembly disassembly mechanisms might differ gene gene
MISC--: here we attempt utilize chip chip binding information gleaned at every promoter yeast genome either plausibly infer exclude pic assembly disassembly mechanisms
OWNX--: major limitation any approach number permutations possible assembly disassembly mechanisms exceeds amount data available constrain mechanisms
MISC--: other words occupancy data alone insufficient uniquely specify ordered pic assembly disassembly pathway
OWNX--: imposition additional constraints predefining either assembly pathway might however eliminate certain dissociation mechanisms incompatible data thus serves purpose plausibly excluding mechanisms rather than uniquely identifying mechanism
OWNX--: here we develop chip modeling program termed pathcom context fixed pic assembly pathway infer allowable dissociation mechanisms
OWNX--: we validate simulation using existing chemical kinetics simulator copasi citation
OWNX--: within declared constraints we discern compatibility different pic disassembly mechanisms at nearly every transcriptionally active gene yeast genome existing chip chip occupancy data
