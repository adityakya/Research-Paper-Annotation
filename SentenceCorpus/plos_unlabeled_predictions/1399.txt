MISC--: eukaryotes interphase nucleus organized morphologically functionally distinct nuclear compartments
MISC--: numerous studies highlight functional relationships between spatial organization nucleus gene regulation
MISC--: this raises question whether nuclear organization principles exist if so whether they identical animal plant kingdoms
OWNX--: we addressed this issue through investigation three dimensional distribution centromeres chromocenters
OWNX--: we investigated five very diverse populations interphase nuclei at different differentiation stages their physiological environment belonging rabbit embryos at cell blastocyst stages differentiated rabbit mammary epithelial cells during lactation differentiated cells arabidopsis thaliana plantlets
OWNX--: we developed new tools based processing confocal images new statistical approach based g f distance functions used spatial statistics
OWNX--: our original computational scheme takes into account both size shape variability comparing each nucleus observed distribution against reference distribution estimated monte carlo sampling over same nucleus
OWNX--: this implicit normalization allowed similar data processing extraction rules five differentiated nuclei populations three studied biological systems despite differences chromosome number genome organization heterochromatin content
OWNX--: we showed centromeres chromocenters form significantly more regularly spaced patterns than expected under completely random situation suggesting repulsive constraints spatial inhomogeneities underlay spatial organization heterochromatic compartments
MISC--: proposed technique should useful identifying further spatial features wide range cell types
MISC--: eukaryotes interphase nucleus organized into distinct nuclear compartments defined macroscopic regions within nucleus morphologically functionally distinct their surrounding citation
MISC--: complex relationships between spatial organization compartments regulation genome function been previously described
MISC--: furthermore changes nuclear architecture among most significant features differentiation development malignant processes
MISC--: thus findings question whether topological landmarks nuclear organization principles exist if so whether architectural principles identical animal plant kingdoms
MISC--: investigate nuclear organization principles multidisciplinary approaches required based image analysis computational biology spatial statistics
MISC--: spatial distributions several compartments proteinaceous bodies genomic domains been analyzed
MISC--: chromosome territories areas genetic content individual chromosomes confined citation citation usually radially distributed gene rich chromosomes more centrally located than gene poor chromosomes
MISC--: some studies report chromosome size could also influence ct location citation citation
MISC--: centromeres may close nuclear periphery those located chromosomes bearing ribosomal genes generally tethered nucleolar periphery citation
MISC--: transcription sites well early replicating foci assumed correspond active chromatin more centrally located whereas inactive heterochromatin tends at nuclear periphery
MISC--: at finer level active genes widely separated cis located different chromosomes colocalize active transcription sites citation citation whereas proximity centromeric heterochromatin nuclear periphery generally associated gene silencing citation citation
MISC--: changes transcriptional status genes been frequently associated their repositioning nucleus relative their cts nuclear periphery repressive centromeric heterochromatin citation citation citation
MISC--: furthermore large reorganization nuclear architecture accompany some differentiation development malignant processes natural variations citation citation
MISC--: however still remains difficult extract common rules establish comparisons due various limitations
MISC--: indeed most data been gathered limited sets nuclear elements isolated plant cell nuclei nuclei immortalized animal cell lines outside their physiological environment except circulating blood cells
MISC--: little known about possible differences nuclear organization cells within their tissue citation
OWNX--: some studies compared nuclear organization primary cells versus cell lines cell lines versus tissues d culture versus d cultures studies suggested tissue architecture involved control nuclear organization citation citation
MISC--: addition data nuclear organization plant cell nuclei situ rare citation citation
MISC--: finally few three dimensional studies quantitative measures been performed investigate spatial nuclear organization citation citation
OWNX--: statistics used analyze data were mostly based radial patterns nuclear elements genes chromosome territories centromeres
MISC--: radial positions been measured respect nuclear geometric center nuclear envelope citation citation
MISC--: spatial affinity between several elements been investigated spatial correlations been assessed through central angles example between radii joining homologous chromosome territory centers nuclear center citation citation
MISC--: alternative approaches based distances between elements been developed
MISC--: distances between small number elements like two pairs homologous alleles were used testing spatial attraction repulsion citation
MISC--: remarkably spatial statistics tools distance functions been developed ecology epidemiology analyzing spatial point patterns citation rarely been applied nuclear organization studies
MISC--: example nearest neighbor distances been used analyze large numbers nuclear elements molecular complexes pml bodies rna polymerase ii foci citation citation
MISC--: alternatively all pairwise inter distances been used analyze spatial distribution chromocenters citation nucleocapsids citation
MISC--: spatial statistics data usually collected through sampling window over single realization point process
MISC--: this point process generally considered unbounded spatially homogeneous
OWNX--: theoretical framework makes sense applications investigated phenomenon extends far beyond observed region
OWNX--: contrast analyses nuclear spatial patterns based images entire nuclei whole domain interest observed
OWNX--: furthermore one should not consider observed nuclear patterns realizations spatially homogeneous point processes
OWNX--: another difference replicated data available analysis carried out sample nuclei
MISC--: recently distance functions been extended replicated spatially heterogeneous point patterns citation citation
MISC--: instance extended f function been used analyzing spatial patterns transmissible spongiform encephalopathy lesions brain tissue citation
MISC--: extended f function takes into account expected spatial heterogeneity point process intensity
OWNX--: estimate this intensity replicated patterns first registered locate all observed points common coordinate system
MISC--: however this type preliminary registration not possible nuclei due lack identifiable nuclear landmarks
MISC--: hence further developments required make spatial statistics tools appropriate nuclear spatial organization studies
AIMX--: this study we develop approach furthering analysis nuclear spatial organization
MISC--: spatial distributions nuclear compartments were quantified using cumulative distribution functions nearest neighbor distances distances between arbitrary points within nucleus their nearest compartment
OWNX--: analysis g f functions was designed specifically cope patterns observed non registered variable domains
AIMX--: we applied this new approach investigation d distribution centric pericentric heterochromatin five interphase nuclei populations belonging animal plant kingdoms citation
MISC--: centric pericentric compartment was chosen due its dual structural regulatory functions
MISC--: indeed usually behaves transcription repressor essential genome organization proper segregation genetic information during cell division citation citation
MISC--: this compartment often clusters forms chromocenters citation citation
OWNX--: we studied nuclei cells at various differentiation stages three biological systems rabbit embryos at cell blastocyst stages differentiated rabbit mammary epithelial cells during lactation differentiated cells thaliana plantlets
OWNX--: we found non completely random significantly more regularly spaced patterns than expected under complete randomness centric pericentric heterochromatin compartment five differentiated cell populations suggesting existence inter kingdom nuclear organizational rules possible nuclear regularities
