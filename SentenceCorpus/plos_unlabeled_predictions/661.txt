OWNX--: functional brain networks detected task free functional magnetic resonance imaging small world architecture reflects robust functional organization brain
OWNX--: here we examined whether this functional organization disrupted alzheimer s disease
OWNX--: task free fmri data ad subjects age matched controls were obtained
MISC--: wavelet analysis was applied fmri data compute frequency dependent correlation matrices
OWNX--: correlation matrices were thresholded create node undirected graphs functional brain networks
MISC--: small world metrics were computed using graph analytical methods
OWNX--: low frequency interval hz functional brain networks controls showed small world organization brain activity characterized high clustering coefficient low characteristic path length
MISC--: contrast functional brain networks ad showed loss small world properties characterized significantly lower clustering coefficient indicative disrupted local connectivity
OWNX--: clustering coefficients left right hippocampus were significantly lower ad group compared control group
OWNX--: furthermore clustering coefficient distinguished ad participants controls sensitivity percent specificity percent
MISC--: our study provides new evidence there disrupted organization functional brain networks ad
MISC--: small world metrics characterize functional organization brain ad our findings further suggest network measures may useful imaging based biomarker distinguish ad healthy aging
MISC--: alzheimer s disease neurodegenerative disorder characterized progressive impairment episodic memory other cognitive domains resulting dementia ultimately death
MISC--: imaging studies ad begun shift studies brain structure citation citation more recent studies highlighting focal regions abnormal brain function citation citation
MISC--: most recently fmri studies moved beyond focal activation abnormalities dysfunctional brain connectivity
MISC--: functional connectivity defined temporal correlations between spatially distinct brain regions citation
MISC--: pet studies restricted across subject connectivity measures shown ad patients decreased hippocampus connectivity prefrontal cortex citation posterior cingulate cortex citation during memory tasks
MISC--: using fmri we demonstrated ad patients performing simple motor task had reduced intra subject functional connectivity within network brain regions termed default mode network includes posterior cingulate cortex temporoparietal junction hippocampus citation
MISC--: bokde et al reported abnormalities fusiform gyrus connectivity during face matching task subjects mild cognitive impairment frequently precursor ad citation
MISC--: three recent studies reported reduced default mode network deactivation mci ad patients during encoding tasks citation citation during semantic classification task citation
MISC--: celone et al also reported increased default mode network deactivation subset less impaired mci patients
OWNX--: addition analyzing functional connectivity during task performance functional connectivity also been investigated during task free conditions
MISC--: task free functional connectivity mri detects interregional correlations spontaneous blood oxygen level dependent signal fluctuations citation
MISC--: using this approach wang et al found disrupted functional connectivity between hippocampus several neocortical regions ad citation
MISC--: similarly li et al reported reduced intrahippocampal connectivity during task free conditions citation
MISC--: most recently sorg et al citation reported reduced resting state functional connectivity default mode network mci patients
MISC--: although evidence accumulating ad disrupts functional connections between brain regions citation not clear whether ad disrupts global functional brain organization
MISC--: graph metrics clustering coefficient characteristic path length useful measures global organization large scale networks citation
MISC--: graphs data structures nodes edges between nodes
MISC--: clustering coefficient measure local network connectivity
MISC--: network high average clustering coefficient characterized densely connected local clusters
MISC--: characteristic path length measure how well connected network network low characteristic path length characterized short distances between any two nodes
MISC--: small world network characterized high clustering coefficient low characteristic path length citation citation
MISC--: graphical representation brain network node corresponds brain region while edge corresponds functional interaction between two brain regions
MISC--: functional connectivity networks human brain derived electroencephalograms magnetoencephalograms task free fmri data exhibit small world characteristics citation citation
MISC--: recent eeg study stam et al reported small world architecture functional networks brain disrupted ad citation
MISC--: here we examined global functional organization brain ad creating whole brain functional connectivity networks task free fmri data characterizing organization networks using small world metrics comparing characteristics between ad patients age matched controls
OWNX--: we hypothesized global functional brain organization would abnormal ad
OWNX--: further given need reliable non invasive clinical test ad citation we sought determine whether small world metric obtained task free fmri data might provide sensitive specific biomarker ad
