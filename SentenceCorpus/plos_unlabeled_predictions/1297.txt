OWNX--: understanding computations performed neuronal circuits requires characterizing strength dynamics connections between individual neurons
OWNX--: this characterization typically achieved measuring correlation activity two neurons
MISC--: we developed new measure studying connectivity neuronal circuits based information theory incremental mutual information
CONT--: conditioning out temporal dependencies responses individual neurons before measuring dependency between them imi improves standard correlation based measures several important ways potential disambiguate statistical dependencies reflect connection between neurons those caused other sources provided dependencies appropriate timescales study early sensory systems does not require responses repeated trials identical stimulation does not assume connection between neurons linear
MISC--: we describe theory implementation imi detail demonstrate its utility experimental recordings primate visual system
MISC--: understand function neuronal circuits systems essential characterize connections between individual neurons
CONT--: major connections between within many brain areas been mapped through anatomical studies but maps specify only existence connections not their strength dynamics
OWNX--: measuring strength dynamics connection between two neurons requires physiological experiments activity both neurons measured
MISC--: most direct experiments involves intracellular recordings allow connection between two neurons directly investigated
CONT--: however intracellular recordings difficult perform vivo impossible obtain more than few cells at time
MISC--: instead most physiological studies connectivity rely extracellular recordings multi electrode arrays
MISC--: experiments not usually possible explicitly verify anatomical connectivity nor directly characterize connections
OWNX--: instead strength dynamics functional connectivity must inferred through statistical methods
OWNX--: traditional method characterizing strength dynamics connection between two neurons cross correlation function measures linear correlation between two signals over range specified delays citation
MISC--: while c xy its variants been used successfully number studies limitations must considered when studying connection between neurons citation citation
OWNX--: limitations c xy arise fact measure total dependency between two signals thus implicitly assumes all dependencies between them due their connection
MISC--: case neurons there fact many potential sources dependency shared external stimuli intrinsic cellular network properties etc c xy cannot disambiguate dependencies those due actual connection
CONT--: several modified versions c xy been proposed address drawbacks
MISC--: example if neuronal activity response repeated trials same external stimulus available analysis often case early sensory systems shift predictor used remove some correlations due stimulus citation
MISC--: further modifications c xy also been proposed remove correlations due stimulus driven covariations activity citation background activity citation
MISC--: while modified approaches certainly improved upon standard c xy confound dependencies due connection those arising other sources remains general problem
MISC--: addition correlation based methods there several other approaches characterizing dependency between two signals used study connection between two neurons
MISC--: methods generally divided into two classes model based model free
MISC--: most common model based approach characterizing dependency granger causality citation
MISC--: gc one signal predicted two different ways using autoregressive model based its own past using multivariate autoregressive model based its own past past second signal
MISC--: strength dependency given difference predictive power two models dynamics dependency reflected regression parameters correspond influence second signal
MISC--: power model based approaches gc dependent validity underlying model if dependency between two signals approximately linear then characterization provided gc will accurate but situations where properties dependency complex unknown often case neurons model free approach may more appropriate
MISC--: most common model free approach characterizing dependency transfer entropy information theoretic analog gc citation
MISC--: te measures reduction entropy one signal achieved conditioning its own past past second signal relative reduction entropy achieved conditioning its own past alone
CONT--: te powerful tool measuring overall strength dependency but not suitable characterizing its dynamics
AIMX--: this paper we detail new model free approach characterizing both strength dynamics dependency conditioning out temporal correlations both signals before assessing strength dependency at different delays
MISC--: this approach overcome some confounds common studies neuronal connectivity citation citation potential disambiguate statistical dependencies reflect connection between neurons those caused other sources provided dependencies appropriate timescales
OWNX--: following sections we outline theory behind our measure we call incremental mutual information illustrate its usage simulated neuronal activity experimental recordings primate visual system consider its relationship other common measures dependence
