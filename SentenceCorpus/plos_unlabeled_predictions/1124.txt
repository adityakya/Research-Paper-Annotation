MISC--: atherosclerosis main cause coronary heart disease stroke two major causes death developed society
MISC--: there emerging evidence excess risk cardiovascular disease at low radiation doses various occupationally exposed groups receiving small daily radiation doses
MISC--: assuming they causal mechanisms effects chronic fractionated radiation exposures cardiovascular disease unclear
OWNX--: we outline spatial reaction diffusion model atherosclerosis perform stability analysis based wherever possible human data
OWNX--: we show predicted consequence multiple small radiation doses cause mean chemo attractant concentration increase linearly cumulative dose
OWNX--: main driver increase mcp monocyte death consequent reduction mcp degradation
MISC--: radiation induced risks predicted model quantitatively consistent those observed number occupationally exposed groups
MISC--: changes equilibrium mcp concentrations low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration also consistent experimental epidemiologic data
OWNX--: this proposed mechanism would experimentally testable
MISC--: if true also substantive implications radiological protection at present does not take cardiovascular disease into account
MISC--: japanese bomb survivor data implies cardiovascular disease cancer mortality contribute similarly radiogenic risk
MISC--: major uncertainty assessing low dose risk cardiovascular disease shape dose response relationship unclear japanese data
AIMX--: analysis present paper suggests linear extrapolation would appropriate this endpoint
MISC--: atherosclerosis main cause coronary heart disease stroke two major causes death developed society citation
MISC--: though previously initiation atherosclerosis was attributed mainly lipid accumulation within arterial walls now widely accepted inflammation plays vital role initiation progression disease citation citation
MISC--: some time cardiovascular effects high dose radiotherapy been known citation citation
OWNX--: variety effects observed presumed result inactivation large numbers cells associated functional impairment affected tissue
MISC--: among effects direct damage structures heart including marked diffuse fibrotic damage especially pericardium myocardium pericardial adhesions microvascular damage stenosis valves coronary arteries sorts damage occur both patients receiving rt experimental animals citation
MISC--: there emerging evidence excess risk cardiovascular disease at much lower radiation doses occurring long time after radiation exposure japanese atomic bomb survivor life span study cohort citation citation various occupationally exposed groups citation citation although not all
MISC--: assuming they causal likely mechanisms effects low dose chronic radiation exposures cardiovascular disease not clear citation citation
OWNX--: interest elevated levels pro inflammatory cytokines il crp tnf inf but also increased levels anti inflammatory cytokine il been observed japanese atomic bomb survivors citation citation
MISC--: there was also dose related elevation erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels igg iga total immunoglobulins this cohort all markers systemic inflammation citation
AIMX--: this paper we outline mathematical formulation model cardiovascular disease largely based inflammatory hypothesis articulated ross citation citation
MISC--: motivation behind mathematical modelling encompass various factors contributing inflammatory process subsequently atherosclerotic formation
OWNX--: atherosclerosis not only multifactorial but also multi step disease we concentrate modelling chronic inflammation primarily at early stages disease but outlining treatment later stages lead plaque rupture
BASE--: model some extent based model mckay et al citation although there significant departures elaborations this model
MISC--: particular features borrowed generally rather simpler models cobbold et al citation ibragimov et al citation
MISC--: stability analysis simplified version model will performed
OWNX--: we shall particularly concerned mechanisms effects cholesterol fractionated low dose radiation exposure this inflammation model outline case radiation induced monocyte cell death candidate pathway
