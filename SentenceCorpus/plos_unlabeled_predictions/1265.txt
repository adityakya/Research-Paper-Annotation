MISC--: genetic basis organismal evolution one fundamental problems biology citation citation
MISC--: modes selection phenotypes would influence fixation probabilities mutations affect phenotypes citation profile mutations fixed during course evolution would determine architecture genomes genetic systems underlying phenotypes citation
MISC--: however because genetic systems would modify phenotypic effects mutations properties genetic system would influence rates directions phenotypic evolution well mutational robustness evolvability citation citation
MISC--: therefore both phenotypes genetic systems evolved mutually influencing each other
MISC--: gene regulatory networks constitute important parts genetic systems involved various biological processes environmental responses unicellular organisms cell differentiation multicellular organisms citation citation citation

MISC--: addition recent studies addressed structural features complex grns redundancy scale free outdegree distributions exponential indegree distributions citation citation citation contribution features genetic characteristics mutational robustness evolvability citation citation
MISC--: one important question regard evolution complex grns evolutionary origin structural mutational properties
MISC--: various evolutionary processes simultaneously influence grn evolution properties interrelated
MISC--: thus difficult identify factors promoted evolution properties could evolve result being directly influenced selection also incidentally result other factors citation citation
MISC--: thus identify factors responsible evolution properties complex grns necessary consider not only selection but also various mutational processes constraining processes
MISC--: selection phenotype one most important driving forces organismal evolution
MISC--: however impact phenotypic selection evolution grns unclear
MISC--: mode selection strongly influences fate mutations profile mutations fixed during course evolution ultimately determines architecture grns
MISC--: thus important examine how different modes phenotypic selection would affect evolution grns
MISC--: however there significant limitations our general understanding processes adaptation evolutionary biology

MISC--: other hand fixation beneficial mutations phenotypic adaptation under changing environments limited citation
MISC--: many studies suggested some examples grn architectures related mutational robustness evolvability citation citation citation citation
MISC--: theoretical studies proposed genetic properties appear evolvable traits citation citation citation genetic properties could play significant role organismal evolution citation
MISC--: however unclear how mutational robustness evolvability influences process grn evolution

MISC--: mutations particular ultimate source genetic variation
MISC--: thus biased properties mutations potentially influence tendency organism evolve
MISC--: example probability transcription factor binding site formation result mutations could vary several orders magnitude mainly owing extensive variation size potential cis regulatory regions among organisms citation citation rate gene deletion could several times higher than rate gene duplication certain organisms citation citation
OWNX--: moreover been suggested horizontal transfer regulatory genes observed lesser extent than phenotypic genes citation
