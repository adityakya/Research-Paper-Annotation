MISC--: lightness illusions fundamental human perception yet why we see them still focus much research
OWNX--: here we address question modelling not human physiology perception directly typically case but our natural visual world need robust behaviour
OWNX--: artificial neural networks were trained predict reflectance surfaces synthetic ecology consisting d dead leaves scenes under non uniform illumination
OWNX--: networks learned solve this task accurately robustly given only ambiguous sense data
MISC--: addition direct consequence their experience networks also made systematic errors their behaviour commensurate human illusions includes brightness contrast assimilation although assimilation only emerged when virtual ecology included d opposed d scenes
OWNX--: subtle variations illusions also found human perception were observed asymmetry brightness contrast
OWNX--: data suggest illusions arise humans because natural stimuli ambiguous this ambiguity resolved empirically encoding statistical relationship between images scenes past visual experience
OWNX--: since resolving stimulus ambiguity challenge faced all visual systems corollary findings human illusions must experienced all visual animals regardless their particular neural machinery
MISC--: data also provide more formal definition illusion condition true source stimulus differs what its most likely source
MISC--: illusions not fundamentally different non illusory percepts all being direct manifestations statistical relationship between images scenes
OWNX--: understanding how we generate accurate perceptions surfaces often best informed understanding why we sometimes do not
MISC--: thus illusions lightness essential tools vision research
MISC--: many natural environments light levels vary across space over time
MISC--: important able perceive surfaces independently this varying light intensity order forage predate successfully example
CONT--: number models lightness perception been proposed but most fail deal complex stimuli only demonstrate narrow range behaviours
MISC--: instance one well known heuristic model predicts human lightness perceptions first subdividing stimuli into multiple local frameworks based instance junction analysis co planarity well other classic gestalt factors
MISC--: then within each framework ratio patch s intensity maximum intensity patch s local framework used predict reflectance combining bright white large white area rule citation
MISC--: rules well defined effective simple stimuli but application rule not been studied more complex images citation
MISC--: indeed hard see how model could applied even moderately complex stimuli much less natural scenes under spatially heterogeneous illumination without extremely complex edge classification rules yet undefined
OWNX--: furthermore human based heuristics provide little insight into physiological computational principles vision relevant all visual animals
MISC--: more computational approaches other hand less descriptive more quantitative make fewer assumptions
MISC--: example artificial neural networks been trained extract scene information object shape movement simple synthetic images citation citation statistical approach using gibbs sampling markov random fields been used separate reflectance illumination simple images citation
MISC--: most models however unable explain brightness contrast assimilation simultaneously without recourse one more adjustable weighting factors
MISC--: one approach blakeslee mccourt filter model citation
MISC--: applying set filters model produces results correspond closely psychophysical results wide range illusory stimuli
OWNX--: same model however fails predict asymmetry brightness contrast where darker surrounds cause larger illusions than equally lighter surrounds we discuss later
CONT--: while asymmetries not captured odog model presently implemented permitting different gain parameters applied outputs independent channels off channels would constitute logical first step toward accommodating differences citation
MISC--: also important stress model does not attempt predict reflectance surfaces only perceived brightness stimulus therefore unable explain lightness constancy more natural scenes under spatially heterogeneous illumination
MISC--: related machine vision work includes separation luminance changes into those caused shading those caused paint surface using filters mixture gaussians citation localised mixture experts set multiscale filters been used extract intrinsic components image including de noising citation
MISC--: however studies do not attempt explain human perception lightness illusions
OWNX--: thus explanations why how we see lightness illusions remain incomplete
OWNX--: here we take different approach rationalising human illusions extension lightness perception generally
OWNX--: rather than modelling human perception known primate physiology typical most models we instead model empirical process vision resolves most fundamental challenge visual ecology inherent ambiguity visual stimuli
OWNX--: we make no assumptions about particular physiology cognition but instead model process development learning stimuli feedback environment
MISC--: this analogous experiential learning any animal whose behaviour guided visually must learn resolve perceptual ambiguity order survive
