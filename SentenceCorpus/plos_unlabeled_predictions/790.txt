MISC--: when coordinating movements nervous system often decide how distribute work across number redundant effectors
AIMX--: here we show humans solve this problem trying minimize both variability motor output effort involved
MISC--: previous studies investigated temporal shape movements two selective pressures despite having very different theoretical implications could not distinguished because noise motor system increases motor commands minimization effort variability leads very similar predictions
MISC--: when multiple effectors different noise effort characteristics combined however two cost terms dissociated
OWNX--: here we measure importance variability effort coordination studying how humans share force production between two fingers
OWNX--: capture variability we identified coefficient variation index little fingers
OWNX--: effort we used sum squared forces sum squared forces normalized maximum strength each effector
OWNX--: terms were then used predict optimal force distribution task participants had produce target total force n pressing onto two isometric transducers using different combinations fingers
OWNX--: comparing predicted distribution across fingers actual distribution chosen participants we were able estimate relative importance variability effort unnormalized effort being most important
OWNX--: our results indicate nervous system uses multi effector redundancy minimize both variability produced output effort although effort costs clearly outweighed variability costs
MISC--: motor system highly redundant same task always accomplished many different sequences motor commands citation
MISC--: part this redundancy caused fact there often multiple muscles effectors produce same desired effect
OWNX--: thus case multi effector redundancy brain choose how distribute given task across set muscles
MISC--: despite infinite number possibilities motor system appears prefer particular solutions
MISC--: example when moving wrist we combine action different forearm muscles predictable cosine tuning like fashion citation
OWNX--: explain regularities we ask why brain coordinating movements this way citation i e we propose hypothetical cost function biological system minimized over course learning
OWNX--: determining form this cost function assuming nervous system had sufficient exploration task dynamics find optimal solution we make testable predictions about how biological movements should produced under given task constraint
MISC--: number different cost functions biological movements been proposed citation citation
MISC--: most studies addressed movements redundancy temporal here there may only one muscle desired effect but there still many different ways distributing motor commands over movement period
MISC--: example all possible shapes arm eye movement motor system consistently chooses bell shaped velocity profile citation
MISC--: different components cost functions generally divided into two classes effort variability costs
MISC--: effort costs usually take form sum squared muscle activations motor commands citation citation
MISC--: alternatively both harris wolpert citation burdet milner citation proposed nervous system chooses sequence motor commands minimizes variability at endpoint movement
MISC--: under assumption signal dependent noise i e noise increases monotonically motor command this model predict important characteristics control both arm eye
MISC--: while effort variability costs different theoretical implications learning mechanism involved optimization motor behaviours they make very similar predictions concerning temporal shape optimal movement
MISC--: indeed shown requirement reduce variability under signal dependent noise leads term cost function penalizes sum squared motor commands over movement identically term commonly associated effort citation
MISC--: thus motor behaviours mainly temporal redundancy variability effort costs hard dissociate
MISC--: motor behaviours multi effector redundancy however minimization variability costs minimization effort costs lead substantially different predictions concerning distribution work across effectors because noise effort characteristics different effectors partly independent
AIMX--: here we study how humans distribute work across different fingers when they produce given target force
OWNX--: measuring independent noise characteristics maximal force finger we dissociate influence variability effort costs coordination
