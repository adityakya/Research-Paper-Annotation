MISC--: molecular chaperones essential elements protein quality control machinery governs translocation folding nascent polypeptides refolding degradation misfolded proteins activation wide range client proteins
MISC--: prokaryotic heat shock protein dnak e coli representative ubiquitous hsp family specializes binding exposed hydrophobic regions unfolded polypeptides
MISC--: accurate prediction dnak binding sites e coli proteins essential prerequisite understand precise function this chaperone properties its substrate proteins
MISC--: order map dnak binding sites protein sequences we developed algorithm combines sequence information peptide binding experiments structural parameters homology modelling
OWNX--: we show this combination significantly outperforms either single approach
MISC--: final predictor had matthews correlation coefficient when assessed over tested peptide sequences detect true positives true negatives
OWNX--: test robustness learning set we conducted simulated cross validation where we omit sequences learning sets calculate rate repredicting them
MISC--: this resulted surprisingly good mcc
MISC--: algorithm was also able perform equally well blind test set binders non binders there was no prior knowledge learning sets

MISC--: hsp molecular chaperones part quality control machinery functions assist protein folding
MISC--: members hsp family been implicated refolding misfolded proteins folding newly synthesized polypeptide chains disassembly larger aggregates translocation proteins organelles citation
MISC--: hsp molecules also enable cell survival during stress heat shock conditions characterized increased concentration denatured polypeptides
MISC--: chaperones recognize bind misfolded aggregation prone peptide stretches through exposed hydrophobic regions normally buried protein core
