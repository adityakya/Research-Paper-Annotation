MISC--: even post genomic era identification candidate genes within loci associated human genetic diseases very demanding task because critical region may typically contain hundreds positional candidates
MISC--: since genes implicated similar phenotypes tend share very similar expression profiles high throughput gene expression data may represent very important resource identify best candidates sequencing
CONT--: however so far gene coexpression not been used very successfully prioritize positional candidates
OWNX--: we show possible reliably identify disease relevant relationships among genes massive microarray datasets concentrating only genes sharing similar expression profiles both human mouse
OWNX--: moreover we show systematically integration human mouse conserved coexpression phenotype similarity map allows efficient identification disease genes large genomic regions
OWNX--: finally using this approach omim loci characterized unknown molecular basis we propose high probability candidates genetic diseases
OWNX--: our results demonstrate conserved coexpression even at human mouse phylogenetic distance represents very strong criterion predict disease relevant relationships among human genes
MISC--: last two decades positional cloning been remarkably successful identification genes involved human disorders
MISC--: more recently our ability map genetic disease loci strikingly increased due availability entire genome sequence
MISC--: nevertheless once disease locus been mapped identification mutation responsible phenotype still represents very demanding task because mapped region may typically contain hundreds candidates citation
MISC--: accordingly many phenotypes mapped genome linkage analysis not yet associated any validated disease gene
MISC--: therefore definition strategies pinpoint most likely targets sequenced patients critical importance citation
MISC--: many different strategies been proposed prioritize genes located critical map intervals
MISC--: some methods so far developed rely observation disease genes tend share common global properties deduced directly absolute comparative sequence analysis citation
MISC--: however most available prioritization strategies based widely accepted idea genes proteins living organisms deploy their functions part sophisticated functional modules based complex series physical metabolic regulatory interactions citation citation
MISC--: although this principle been extensively used even pre genome era identify critical players many different biological phenomena present availability genome scale information gene function protein protein interactions gene expression different experimental models allows unprecedented opportunities approaching prioritization problem greater efficiency
CONT--: theory use functional gene annotations would represent most straightforward approach candidate prioritization
BASE--: however although this strategy may very useful selected cases citation citation at present stage clear limitations either because overlooks non annotated genes citation citation because not evident how annotated functions candidates relate disease phenotype
MISC--: therefore computational methods less biased toward already consolidated knowledge may strong advantages citation
MISC--: particular protein protein interaction maps gene coexpression data microarray experiments represent extremely rich sources potentially relevant information
MISC--: recently direct integration very heterogeneous human interactome text mining based map phenotype similarity allowed prediction high confidence candidates within large disease associated loci citation
OWNX--: although this approach highly efficient clearly not exhaustive because very close functional relationships between genes proteins possible absence direct molecular binding
MISC--: addition protein protein interaction space currently under sampled many genuine biological interactions not yet been identified experiments
MISC--: conversely high throughput experiments known result large fraction false positives
MISC--: consistently low overlap protein protein interactions between large scale experiments even when same proteins considered testament problems citation
MISC--: finally many known protein protein interactions been ascertained through low throughput experiments thus strongly biased towards better studied proteins citation
MISC--: since genes involved same functions tend show very similar expression profiles coexpression analysis could very powerful approach inferring functional relationships may correlate similar disease phenotypes
MISC--: accordingly global analyses shown genes highly coexpressed across microarray experiments display very similar functional annotation citation
CONT--: however notable exceptions citation so far coexpression criterion not been employed very successfully prediction genetic disease candidates been used this purpose only combination other independent evidence citation citation
OWNX--: noisy nature high throughput gene expression datasets may represent one possible explanations this shortcoming
OWNX--: moreover even when coexpression two genes reproducibly observed under high number experimental conditions this does not necessarily imply genes functionally related
MISC--: instance extensive meta analysis microarray data across different species revealed neighboring genes more likely coexpressed than genes encoded distant genomic regions even if they not functionally related any obvious manner citation citation
MISC--: phylogenetic conservation been previously proposed very strong criterion identify functionally relevant coexpression links among genes citation citation
MISC--: indeed significant coexpression two more orthologous genes very likely due selective advantage strongly suggesting functional relation
MISC--: therefore conserved coexpression could much stronger criterion than single species coexpression relate genes involved similar disease phenotypes
OWNX--: this report we show conserved coexpression phenome analysis effectively integrated produce accurate predictions human disease genes
OWNX--: using this approach we were able select small number strong candidates human diseases corresponding wide spectrum different phenotypes
