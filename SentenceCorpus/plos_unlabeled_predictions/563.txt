MISC--: combination therapies often needed effective clinical outcomes management complex diseases but presently they generally based empirical clinical experience
MISC--: here we suggest novel application search algorithms originally developed digital communication modified optimize combinations therapeutic interventions
OWNX--: biological experiments measuring restoration decline age heart function exercise capacity drosophila melanogaster we found search algorithms correctly identified optimal combinations four drugs using only one third tests performed fully factorial search
MISC--: experiments identifying combinations three doses up six drugs selective killing human cancer cells search algorithms resulted highly significant enrichment selective combinations compared random searches
OWNX--: simulations using network model cell death we found search algorithms identified optimal combinations interventions percent tests compared percent equivalent random search
MISC--: findings suggest modified search algorithms information theory potential enhance discovery novel therapeutic drug combinations
MISC--: this report also helps frame biomedical problem will benefit interdisciplinary effort suggests general strategy its solution
MISC--: problem combination therapy medical algorithmic aspects
OWNX--: medically we still not able provide effective cures most chronic complex diseases main causes death disability nor we able address progressive age related decline human functional capacity
MISC--: algorithmically when biological dysfunction involves complex biological networks therapeutic interventions multiple targets likely required
MISC--: because effect drugs depends dose several doses need studied number possible combinations rises quickly
MISC--: example many cancer chemotherapy regimens composed more drugs pool more than clinically used anticancer drugs exploring even larger combinations might justified citation
OWNX--: if we were study all combinations out compounds at different doses we would possibilities
OWNX--: this example shows problem requires qualitatively new approach rather than simply more efficient screening technology
MISC--: combined drug interventions common therapeutic strategy complex diseases hypertension cancer
MISC--: pointed out recently cancer therapy citation most therapies were initially developed effective single agents only later combined clinically
AIMX--: possible approach exploration new therapeutic activities not present individual drugs based exhaustive study all possible combinations pairs compounds citation
MISC--: this brute force approach detected many interesting novel pairs compounds citation but resulting exponential expansion number possibilities precludes comprehensive exploration larger combinations
MISC--: several authors citation citation recently argued future combination therapy lies development accurate quantitative network models capture mechanistic interactions cellular organism physiology
BASE--: fitzgerald et al citation acknowledge we do not yet know what models will look like systems biology research still data limited this purpose
MISC--: indeed their recent review does not report any successful application this approach combination therapies
OWNX--: here we suggest novel solution problem combination drug therapy making use search algorithms originally developed digital communication
MISC--: when modified several key aspects search strategies used find more effective combined therapeutic interventions without need fully factorial experimental design
MISC--: algorithms may also provide framework upon information system wide molecular data mechanistic computational networks models superimposed
CONT--: understand motivation our work important consider even if simulations might play role intended use algorithms not entirely silico but partially vivo vitro using high throughput biological measurements organisms isolated cells respectively
CONT--: this approach becomes increasingly relevant because high throughput measurement technology initially developed drug companies screening large libraries compounds multi well plate formats now more more available scientific community
OWNX--: useful regard information processing our experimental systems parallel biological computations since algorithms we using indeed derived algorithms were implemented silico other scientific fields
OWNX--: parallel measurements suitable multi well high throughput technology
MISC--: there requirements regarding computational complexity algorithms limit choice suitable approaches
MISC--: requirements discussed more detail results
MISC--: both number operations computational costs unique vivo vitro algorithms should considered
MISC--: algorithm design requires application appropriate structure data
OWNX--: although there many options represent space possible drug combinations we used tree representation drug combinations nodes linking all possible additions one drug next level
MISC--: individual drugs form base tree combinations maximum size at top
OWNX--: when exploring drug combination tree going smaller larger combinations algorithms we suggest we giving more weight lower order drug interactions
MISC--: this consistent data available adverse drug interactions reported mostly two drug combinations citation citation
MISC--: estimating optimal size combination different problem examined detail discussion
OWNX--: beneficial effect combination also due additive components multiple higher order effects
MISC--: search algorithms we suggest derived sequential decoding algorithms
MISC--: were chosen part because similarities among data trees searched biological decoding applications
MISC--: sequential decoding algorithms used convolutional codes nearby nodes data tree related similarly different but partially overlapping combinations drugs
OWNX--: another feature sequential algorithms fit our purposes use list based memory path taken reach each node
OWNX--: we provide discussion detailed argument suggesting suitable algorithm should able integrate all available information state system obtained iterative measurements
MISC--: integration should take place at every iteration within algorithm rather than being weighted average different methods applied separately
MISC--: presence updated list guide each iteration provides our algorithms natural mean information integration
AIMX--: both fully factorial dataset we show figure complex structure biological networks being reconstructed systems biology supports this expectation frequent non linearities phenotype measurements along data tree
OWNX--: therefore we interested algorithms search within solution space presenting substantial non linearities
MISC--: if relation among drugs combination were linear best algorithm would simply determine best dose single drug measurements use obtain best combination
MISC--: if contrary non linearities were extreme use stochastic algorithms might preferable
MISC--: stochastic algorithms cope multiple local minima solution space but they do so incorporating random element
MISC--: this requires price terms computational cost performance stochastic algorithms therefore often not good more tailored algorithms citation citation
MISC--: algorithms we suggest cope moderate variable non linearities going back previous nodes tree
OWNX--: starting stack sequential algorithm was developed search optimal decoding field digital communications citation we describe test algorithms used search optimal combination sizeable number drugs testing only small subset all possible combinations
MISC--: algorithms useful large combinations where collecting fully factorial datasets not feasible
AIMX--: we present results obtained simulations computational model cell death experiments using two models complementary biological properties restoring decline age heart function exercise capacity drosophila melanogaster selective killing human cancer cells
MISC--: first vivo experimental model advantage including complexity whole organism interventions while second vitro model potential markedly higher throughput testing
MISC--: models also representative two different general types multi drug interventions one type aims at improving function while other based induction cell death selective disruption network function
OWNX--: results suggest optimal near optimal combinations compounds found systems only small fraction number tests fully factorial design significantly higher efficacy than random searching
MISC--: summary contributions this work
MISC--: constructing novel problem statement search drug combinations using novel approach systems biology
MISC--: collecting exhaustive experimental measurements sufficient solve problem conclusively
MISC--: constructing computational method solve problem approximately fewer experimental measurements
