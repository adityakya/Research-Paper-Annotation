MISC--: gene regulatory networks consist direct interactions but also include indirect interactions mediated metabolites signaling molecules
MISC--: we describe how indirect interactions derived model underlying biochemical reaction network using weak time scale assumptions combination sensitivity criteria metabolic control analysis
OWNX--: we apply this approach model carbon assimilation network escherichia coli
OWNX--: our results show derived gene regulatory network densely connected contrary what usually assumed
MISC--: moreover network largely sign determined meaning signs indirect interactions fixed flux directions biochemical reactions independently specific parameter values rate laws
OWNX--: inversion fluxes following change growth conditions may affect signs indirect interactions though
MISC--: this leads feedback structure at same time robust changes kinetic properties enzymes flexibility accommodate radical changes environment
MISC--: adaptation bacteria changes their environment involves adjustments expression genes coding enzymes regulators membrane transporters etc citation citation
MISC--: adjustments controlled gene regulatory networks ensuring coordinated expression clusters functionally related genes
MISC--: interactions network may direct case gene coding transcription factor regulating expression another gene
MISC--: most time however regulatory interactions indirect e g when gene encodes enzyme producing transcriptional effector citation
OWNX--: gene regulatory network thus not reduced its transcriptional regulatory interactions ignoring indirect interactions mediated metabolic signaling pathways we may miss crucial feedback loops system
MISC--: network controlling carbon uptake bacterium escherichia coli good example because integrates metabolism signal transduction gene expression
MISC--: at level gene expression network includes intricate feedback loops arise indirect interactions between subsystems
MISC--: global regulators like crp control expression enzymes carbon metabolism citation citation while intermediates latter pathways control expression global regulators
MISC--: instance phosphorylation eiia activates adenylate cyclase produce camp required activation crp citation citation
AIMX--: aim this paper develop method systematic derivation direct indirect interactions gene regulatory network underlying biochemical reaction network
MISC--: due complexity intermediate metabolic signaling networks determining indirect interactions difficult general
MISC--: we show model reduction based quasi steady state approximations expressing weak assumptions time scale hierarchies system citation citation together sensitivity criteria metabolic control analysis citation citation able uncover interactions
MISC--: indeed mca formalism uniquely allows relate systemic sensitivities sensitivities individual reactions reactants effectors citation citation
MISC--: therefore provides proper framework investigating metabolic effects gene regulation
OWNX--: we apply our approach model upper part carbon assimilation network e coli consisting glycolysis gluconeogenesis pathways their genetic metabolic regulation
MISC--: analysis derived gene regulatory network leads three new insights
MISC--: first contrary what often assumed network densely connected due numerous feedback loops resulting indirect interactions
MISC--: this additional complexity important issue correct interpretation data genome wide transcriptome studies
MISC--: second derived gene regulatory network carbon assimilation e coli sign determined sense signs interactions essentially fixed weak information flux directions biochemical reactions without explicit specification kinetic rate laws parameter values
MISC--: therefore feedback structure robust changes kinetic properties enzymes other biochemical reactions species
MISC--: third change environmental conditions may invert fluxes thus signs indirect interactions resulting dynamic rewiring regulatory network
