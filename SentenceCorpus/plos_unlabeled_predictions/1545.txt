OWNX--: intrinsically disordered regions serve molecular recognition elements play important role control many cellular processes signaling pathways
MISC--: useful able predict positions disordered regions protein chains
MISC--: statistical analysis disordered residues was done considering unique protein chains taken pdb database
MISC--: this database percent residues disordered
OWNX--: statistics were obtained separately n c termini well central part protein chain
MISC--: been shown frequencies occurrence disordered residues types at termini protein chains differ ones middle part protein chain
MISC--: our systematic analysis disordered regions pdb revealed disordered patterns different lengths
MISC--: each them disordered occurrences at least five protein chains identity less than percent
OWNX--: vast majority all occurrences each disordered pattern disordered
MISC--: this allows one use library disordered patterns predicting status residue given protein ordered disordered
OWNX--: we analyzed occurrence selected patterns three eukaryotic three bacterial proteomes
MISC--: prediction protein structure function one general directions structural genomics
MISC--: special interest prediction so called disordered regions protein chain
MISC--: disordered regions often play important functional role
MISC--: should emphasized one type disordered regions structured only when they bind other molecules citation under changing conditions biochemical medium citation citation but other kinds disordered regions always disordered never become structured
MISC--: disordered regions protein chains often cause complications upon expression purification crystallization proteins
MISC--: at present more than proteins disordered regions described disprot database citation
MISC--: proteins domains either entirely unstructured native state lengthy disordered regions
MISC--: at functionally important protein regions proteins outside globular domains i e just disordered regions citation citation
MISC--: since disordered regions protein chain play important role protein functioning much attention being paid their examination prediction citation citation
MISC--: indeed been shown disordered proteins certain properties distinguish them proteins well defined structures citation
OWNX--: abundance intrinsic disorder pdb was discussed recent study citation
MISC--: typically disordered regions low aromatic content high net charge well low sequence complexity high flexibility citation citation
MISC--: prediction methods aim identify disordered regions through analysis amino acid sequences using mainly physico chemical properties amino acids citation citation evolutionary conservation citation citation
MISC--: suggested if one same pattern corresponds disordered regions protein structures then highly probable pattern will disordered other proteins
MISC--: search disordered patterns important task prediction disordered regions search functioning considered motifs
MISC--: identification essential features within protein domains greatly facilitate their functional characterization
MISC--: there well established databases protein motif domain information prosite interpro pfam citation citation
MISC--: creation library disordered patterns one primary tasks this respect
MISC--: there no information about library
MISC--: until now we known pest motif most cases degradation motif citation rgd motif found extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin fibrinogen prothrombin tenascin thrombospondin vitronectin etc citation citation
MISC--: exposed rgd motif constitutes major recognition site integrin binding citation
OWNX--: this work we been interested stretches disordered residues
MISC--: rule stretches short loops inside globular domains present only one type disorder because disordered proteins range molten globules chains having no structural preferences whatsoever residues several hundreds even thousands residues citation citation citation
MISC--: we analyzed disordered regions created library disordered motifs their positions protein chains entire protein databank citation
MISC--: taking into account consideration library disordered patterns will help improving accuracies predictions residues structured unstructured inside given region
MISC--: moreover our new statistics occurrence unstructured residues will useful those who dealing prediction status residues ordered disordered
MISC--: combining motif discovery disorder protein segment identification pdb new promising approach further studying understanding functional role obtained patterns different proteomes
MISC--: question about specificity patterns more important biological functioning
OWNX--: we analyzed occurrence obtained patterns some eukaryotic proteomes some bacterial proteomes
