MISC--: acute effects sex steroid hormones likely contribute observation post pubescent males shorter qt intervals than females
MISC--: however specific role hormones modulating cardiac electrophysiological parameters arrhythmia vulnerability unclear
CONT--: here we use computational modeling approach incorporate experimentally measured effects physiological concentrations testosterone estrogen progesterone cardiac ion channel targets
OWNX--: we then study hormone effects ventricular cell tissue dynamics comprised faber rudy computational models
OWNX--: female model predicts changes action potential duration at different stages menstrual cycle consistent clinically observed qt interval fluctuations
MISC--: male model predicts shortening apd qt interval at physiological testosterone concentrations
MISC--: model suggests increased susceptibility drug induced arrhythmia when estradiol levels high while testosterone progesterone apparently protective
OWNX--: simulations predict effects sex steroid hormones clinically observed qt intervals reveal mechanisms estrogen mediated susceptibility prolongation qt interval
MISC--: simulations also indicate acute effects estrogen not alone sufficient cause arrhythmia triggers explain increased risk females torsades de pointes
OWNX--: our results suggest acute effects sex steroid hormones cardiac ion channels sufficient account some aspects gender specific susceptibility long qt linked arrhythmias
MISC--: past decade studies suggested female gender independent risk factor long qt dependent cardiac arrhythmias citation citation
MISC--: since differences qt intervals males females appear time puberty citation citation sex steroid hormone effects cardiac repolarization been implicated
MISC--: clinical studies found no difference qt interval male female children but shorter qt intervals men versus women under age citation
MISC--: international long qt syndrome registry reported females had higher risk first cardiac event between years citation
MISC--: moreover clinical findings observed more than percent drug induced torsade de pointes occur women citation citation
MISC--: known one way sex steroid hormones cause functional physiological changes via transcriptional regulation
MISC--: sex hormones may bind sex hormone receptors then translocate into nucleus
OWNX--: nucleus ligand bound sex hormone receptor acts transcription factor binding promoter region genes containing hormone responsive element leading regulation gene expression
MISC--: example heart lipocalin type prostaglandli d synthase been found transcriptionally upregulated estradiol estrogen receptor citation
OWNX--: this genomic action requires several hours before effects observed
MISC--: addition genomic pathway sex steroid hormones may induce rapid activation mitogen activated protein kinase leading transcription factor activation citation citation well activation membrane bound endothelial nitric oxide synthase citation citation
MISC--: interestingly recent studies demonstrated sex steroid hormones may also act acutely rapidly modulate cardiac ion channel activity directly via pi k akt enos pathway citation citation
MISC--: testosterone induced phosphorylation ser thr kinase akt enos leads no synthase activation production nitric oxide citation
MISC--: no leads s nitrosylation cysteine residues channel underlying slow delayed rectifier k current citation
MISC--: l type ca current conversely suppressed no via cgmp dependent pathway
MISC--: regulation i ks i ca l testosterone dose dependent citation leads shortening action potential duration citation qt intervals citation citation
MISC--: adult men serum testosterone level reported nm citation however circulating levels testosterone begin decline men young citation
MISC--: qt intervals shorter adult men than adult women until around age citation suggesting likely role circulating testosterone
MISC--: females progesterone fluctuates through menstrual cycle
OWNX--: reported serum progesterone level nm follicular phase nm luteal phase citation
MISC--: was recently shown nakamura et al progesterone increases i ks current through no production pathways prevents camp enhancement i ca l citation
MISC--: apparent result acute effects progesterone testosterone shorten ventricular repolarization diminish incidence arrhythmias citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: recently experiments suggested protective effects testosterone against arrhythmia
MISC--: vivo experiments show orchiectomized male rabbits treated dihydrotestosterone had shorter qt interval apd compared non dht treated rabbits citation citation
MISC--: also experiments testosterone treated female animals shown dht reduces drug induced arrhythmia dofetilide citation
MISC--: acute effects estradiol result suppression human ether go go related gene underlying rapid delayed rectifier current directly binding channel altering channel kinetics reducing current citation
MISC--: kurokawa co workers showed estradiol increases channel rate closure lessens repolarizing current
MISC--: they also showed presence e herg more sensitive block drugs
OWNX--: group proposed aromatic centroid e may responsible increasing sensitivity herg block e via interaction aromatic side chain phe aromatic rings herg blocker
OWNX--: because concentration e not constant through menstrual cycle but rather fluctuates peak follicular phase serum e level nm nm luteal phase e dramatic effects sensitivity herg block within this range stands reason susceptibility drug induced arrhythmia herg block may vary through menstrual cycle
MISC--: although studies shown female hormones estradiol progesterone opposite effects cardiac repolarization e prolongs qt intervals progesterone reduces qt interval citation citation citation question whether normal hormonal fluctuations sufficient account variability qt during menstrual cycle not known
MISC--: neither effects physiological concentrations hormones arrhythmia susceptibility well understood
MISC--: some studies do report dynamic fluctuations qt intervals during menstrual cycle related changes susceptibility tdp risk citation citation
MISC--: other studies postmenopausal women also suggest importance female hormones estrogen hormone replacement therapy prolongs qt intervals increases arrhythmia risk citation citation citation
MISC--: other data not found marked fluctuation qt interval during specific phases menstrual cycle citation citation citation
MISC--: burke et al found corrected qt interval does not significantly change through menstrual cycle pre menopausal women however qt c reduced luteal phase after autonomic blockade citation
MISC--: study drug induced qt prolongation during menstrual cycle observed qt c did not vary during menstrual cycle but qt c shortening was more pronounced luteal phase ibutilide application citation
MISC--: nonetheless both clinical experimental data suggest women both longer qt intervals than men more likely develop long qt dependent arrhythmias tdp arrhythmias citation citation
MISC--: women especially susceptible increased arrhythmia risk response qt prolongation drugs citation citation citation citation
MISC--: major challenge specifically determine relationship between sex steroid hormones arrhythmia susceptibility males females since cardiac system extraordinarily complex

AIMX--: present study we focus acute effects sex steroid hormones cardiac ion channel targets
OWNX--: we use guinea pig models incorporate effects hormones measured experimentally guinea pig then test changes specifically within complex cellular tissue milieu
OWNX--: importantly we use model make predictions about effects physiological concentrations sex steroid hormones gender specific cardiac physiology parameters arrhythmia susceptibility
MISC--: some recent experimental studies investigating functional effects sex hormones cardiac function utilized hormone concentrations micromolar range orders magnitude higher than nanomolar physiological circulating concentration e citation
