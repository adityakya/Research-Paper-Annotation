MISC--: paired end sequencing emerging key technique assessing genome rearrangements structural variation genome wide scale
MISC--: this technique particularly useful detecting copy neutral rearrangements inversions translocations common cancer produce novel fusion genes
AIMX--: we address question how much sequencing required detect rearrangement breakpoints localize them precisely using both theoretical models simulation
OWNX--: we derive formula probability fusion gene exists cancer genome given collection paired end sequences this genome
OWNX--: we use this formula compute fusion gene probabilities several breast cancer samples we find we able accurately predict fusion genes samples relatively small number fragments large size
OWNX--: we further demonstrate how ability detect fusion genes depends distribution gene lengths we evaluate how different parameters sequencing strategy impact breakpoint detection breakpoint localization fusion gene detection even presence errors suggest false rearrangements
MISC--: results will useful calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts particularly large scale studies many cancer genomes enabled next generation sequencing technologies
MISC--: cancer disease driven selection somatic mutations
MISC--: mutations range single nucleotide changes large scale chromosomal aberrations deletion duplications inversions translocations
MISC--: while many mutations been cataloged cancer cells via cytogenetics gene resequencing array based techniques there now great interest using genome sequencing provide comprehensive understanding mutations cancer genomes
MISC--: cancer genome atlas one sequencing initiative focuses sequencing efforts pilot phase point mutations coding regions
OWNX--: this approach largely ignores copy neutral genome rearrangements including translocations inversions

MISC--: this view been challenged discovery fusion between tmprss gene several members erg protein family prostate cancer citation eml alk fusion lung cancer citation
MISC--: studies raise question what other recurrent rearrangements remain discovered
OWNX--: one strategy genome wide high resolution identification fusion genes other large scale rearrangements paired end sequencing clones other fragments genomic dna tumor samples
MISC--: resulting end sequence pairs paired reads mapped back reference human genome sequence

AIMX--: this paper we address number theoretical practical considerations assessing cancer genome organization using paired end sequencing approaches
OWNX--: we largely concerned detecting rearrangement breakpoint where pair non adjacent coordinates reference genome adjacent cancer genome
OWNX--: particular we extend this idea breakpoint examine ability detect fusion genes
OWNX--: specifically if clone end sequences mapping distant locations identifies rearrangement cancer genome does this rearrangement lead formation fusion gene
MISC--: obviously sequencing clone will answer this question but this requires additional effort cost may problematic e g most next generation sequencing technologies do not archive genome clone library later analysis
OWNX--: we derive formula probability fusion between pair genomic regions given set all mapped clones empirical distribution clone lengths
OWNX--: probabilities useful prioritizing follow up experiments validate fusion genes
OWNX--: test experiment mcf breast cancer cell line pairs genes were found near clones aberrantly mapping end sequences
OWNX--: however our analysis revealed only pairs genes high probability fusion six were tested five experimentally confirmed
MISC--: advent high throughput sequencing strategies raises important experimental design questions using technologies understand cancer genome organization
MISC--: obviously sequencing more clones improves probability detecting fusion genes breakpoints
MISC--: however even latest sequencing technologies would neither practical nor cost effective shotgun sequence assemble genomes thousands tumor samples
MISC--: thus important maximize probability detecting fusion genes least amount sequencing
MISC--: this probability depends multiple factors including number length end sequenced clones length genes fused possible errors breakpoint localization
AIMX--: here we derive several formulae elucidate trade offs experimental design both current next generation sequencing technologies
OWNX--: our probability calculations simulations demonstrate even current paired end technology we obtain extremely high probability breakpoint detection very low number reads
MISC--: example more than percent all breakpoints detected paired end sequencing less than clones
MISC--: additionally next generation sequencers potentially detect rearrangements greater than percent probability localize breakpoints rearrangements intervals less than bp single run machine
