MISC--: many behavioral phenomena been found spread interpersonally through social networks manner similar infectious diseases
MISC--: important difference between social contagion traditional infectious diseases however behavioral phenomena acquired non social mechanisms well through social transmission
OWNX--: we introduce novel theoretical framework studying phenomena adapting classic disease model include possibility automatic non social infection
AIMX--: we provide example use this framework examining spread obesity framingham heart study network
MISC--: interaction assumptions model validated using longitudinal network transmission data
MISC--: we find current rate becoming obese formula per year increases percentage points each obese social contact
MISC--: rate recovering obesity formula per year does not depend number non obese contacts
OWNX--: model predicts long term obesity prevalence approximately formula used evaluate effect different interventions steady state obesity
MISC--: model predictions quantitatively reproduce actual historical time course prevalence obesity
OWNX--: we find since s rate recovery obesity remained relatively constant while rates both spontaneous infection transmission steadily increased over time
MISC--: this suggests obesity epidemic may driven increasing rates becoming obese both spontaneously transmissively rather than decreasing rates losing weight
MISC--: key feature sisa model its ability characterize relative importance social transmission quantitatively comparing rates spontaneous versus contagious infection
MISC--: provides theoretical framework studying interpersonal spread any state may also arise spontaneously emotions behaviors health states ideas diseases reservoirs
MISC--: social network effects great importance understanding human behavior
MISC--: people interact varying number individuals some individuals more than others this affects behavior fundamental ways
MISC--: sociologists long studied social influence through networks networks now routinely appear investigations other fields including economics citation physics citation public health citation scientific publishing citation citation
MISC--: extensive reviews social networks analysis including investigations their structure their effect social dynamics include mitchell citation wasserman citation watts citation rogers citation jackson citation smith citation
MISC--: networks also long been known important many areas biology including ecological food webs evolution cooperation citation citation
MISC--: social networks also been studied determinants health ranging determining patterns infectious disease spread citation propagation phenomena emotions citation citation smoking cessation citation obesity citation suicide citation altruism citation anti social behavior citation online health forum participation citation
MISC--: studies suggest top physical environment social environment also important contributor health
MISC--: they lead suggestions public health interventions must designed work network structure network exploited spread health related information citation citation
MISC--: within network studies much work focused how information trends behaviors other entities spread between individuals social networks
MISC--: processes generally referred contagion
MISC--: suggestions contagious dynamics possible relevance network structure rigorously examined using mathematical models contagious processes
OWNX--: then used obtain accurate measures expected prevalences interventional efficacy optimized information flow
MISC--: many previous models been proposed study influential interactions between individuals
MISC--: most considered well mixed populations although more recent work focused network structured populations
MISC--: most well studied classic epidemiological models spread microbial infectious diseases citation including spread network structured populations citation citation citation citation
MISC--: various related processes been used model social influence important contributions including same epidemiological models citation citation diffusion models citation citation citation statistical mechanics type interactions citation citation threshold models citation
MISC--: each models however one more properties problematic studying social contagion
MISC--: many do not capture probabilistic nature contagion asymmetry inherent traditional infectious disease
MISC--: others only consider well mixed populations where everyone influenced everyone else ignoring effect network structure
MISC--: most models inspired epidemiology not directly applicable social spread other phenomenon because many phenomena spread social contagion may also arise spontaneously
MISC--: possible adopt trend behavior obtain information outside source without directly catching contact network
MISC--: other words top probability obtaining infection each infected contact there also non zero probability automatically obtaining infection independent local network
MISC--: this automatic non social infection not included traditional infectious disease models
MISC--: economic models diffusion innovations based early work bass citation do take into account automatic infection
MISC--: individuals move susceptible infected state adopting new product idea influenced both social non social factors
MISC--: however models do not allow recovery because innovation adoptions assumed permanent changes behavior individuals never move back susceptible state
OWNX--: this results entire population becoming adopters at equilibrium
MISC--: this does not reflect dynamics many phenomena spread socially may repeatedly acquired lost
OWNX--: through balance infection recovery steady state multiple states individuals coexisting reached
MISC--: finally most previous models make assumptions about type interaction between individuals particulars not usually validated real data
OWNX--: yet long term behavior model prevention strategies suggests depend critically specifics interaction assumptions
AIMX--: here we introduce new model study spread entities social network all important properties listed above
AIMX--: we then analyze its characteristics show how applied different contexts
MISC--: this model extension classical infectious disease model combining features other models mentioned above
MISC--: describes infections contracted both spontaneously through social transmission allows recovery infection
AIMX--: example we focus spread obesity framingham heart study network
MISC--: interaction assumptions model will validated using longitudinal network transmission data
OWNX--: we show how we quantitatively assess values rate adopting trend spontaneously versus contagion determine extent social transmission important
OWNX--: we use predict prevalences intervention effectiveness
OWNX--: results this model very different models other interaction assumptions majority rules models
OWNX--: we will show transmissive components often small compared automatic component but may still contribute materially prevalence levels
MISC--: lastly we will use pair wise approximations generate analytic results infections network structured populations well presenting simulations using real social network
