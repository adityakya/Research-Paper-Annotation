MISC--: halobacterium salinarum bioenergetically flexible halophilic microorganism generate energy respiration photosynthesis fermentation arginine
OWNX--: previous study using genome scale metabolic model we shown archaeon unexpectedly degrades essential amino acids under aerobic conditions behavior lead termination growth earlier than necessary
AIMX--: here we further integratively investigate energy generation nutrient utilization biomass production using extended methodology accounts dynamically changing transport patterns including those arise interactions among supplied metabolites
OWNX--: moreover we widen scope our analysis include phototrophic conditions explore interplay between different bioenergetic modes
MISC--: surprisingly we found cells also degrade essential amino acids even during phototropy when energy should already abundant
OWNX--: we also found under both conditions considerable amounts nutrients were taken up were neither incorporated into biomass nor used respiratory substrates implying considerable production accumulation several metabolites medium
MISC--: some likely products forms overflow metabolism
OWNX--: addition our results also show arginine fermentation contrary what typically assumed occurs simultaneously respiration photosynthesis contribute energy levels comparable primary bioenergetic modes if not more
MISC--: findings portray picture organism takes approach toward growth favors here now even at cost longer term concerns
CONT--: we believe seemingly greedy behavior exhibited actually consists adaptations organism its natural environments where nutrients not only irregularly available but may altogether absent extended periods may span several years
MISC--: setting probably predisposed cells grow much possible when conditions become favorable
MISC--: halobacterium salinarum halophilic archaeon thrives extremely saline environments salt concentrations reaching m higher
MISC--: organism perhaps most well known its retinal protein bacteriorhodopsin light driven proton pump

MISC--: accordingly h salinarum s photosynthetic capabilities its most well studied aspects
OWNX--: example d structure br been resolved its complete catalytic cycle elucidated at molecular level

MISC--: respiration citation citation well fermentation arginine citation citation other mechanisms utilized organism
MISC--: this bioenergetic flexibility makes archaeon good model system investigating interplay between different energy production modes
MISC--: h salinarum also one few reported organisms use potassium gradients long term energy storage battery like manner citation
MISC--: metabolic network organism reconstructed genomic biochemical physiological data citation citation citation
MISC--: this network consists known hypothesized reactions take place within organism considered genome scale when most all genes known metabolic function included citation
AIMX--: we previous study reconstructed proposed network halobacterium salinarum citation
MISC--: addition immediate information gained metabolic reconstructions networks analyzed gain insights emergent system properties through use appropriate computational methods
MISC--: this respect constraints based framework emerged important convenient tool modeling systems because does not require detailed information typically required full kinetic models

OWNX--: our aim this study two fold
OWNX--: first we set out investigate interplay between energy generation nutrient utilization biomass production under different bioenergetic modes
OWNX--: second we also analyzed relationships between different energy producing mechanisms respiration photosynthesis fermentation themselves typically examined individually
OWNX--: achieve we used genome scale metabolic network connects different aspects
CONT--: our results include several findings contrary assumptions typically made particularly respect utilization nutrients how bioenergetic modes operate
OWNX--: more methodological perspective we also sought out extend existing framework hybrid genome scale metabolic models handle biological systems where nutrient utilization growth rates vary time
MISC--: changes nutrient consumption example result differences between growth phases arise interactions between supplied metabolites
OWNX--: we demonstrate extended methodology not only accounts dynamics but several instances actually led identification underlying causes
