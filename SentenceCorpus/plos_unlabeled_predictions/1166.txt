MISC--: reliability each technique been extensively debated literature comprehensive analyses resulted contrasting conclusions citation citation citation
MISC--: however generally accepted any measure reliability not absolute largely dependent nature pre defined gold standard reference set

MISC--: high confidence pin extracted ap ms data gavin et al citation was revealed free abundance effects while those derived data krogan et al citation contained weak abundance biases
OWNX--: therefore would appear high quality ap ms data sets interaction specificity not coupled protein abundance
OWNX--: we note converse recently been found true y h interaction data sets citation
MISC--: high confidence pin derived data gavin et al citation was shown highly modular containing many localized densely connected regions strikingly different commensurate random network
OWNX--: we also demonstrated observed high modularity not result misinterpreting indirect associations direct interactions rather result direct physical associations
OWNX--: furthermore we suggest modularity y h interaction data sets may underrepresented indirect associations pins significantly enriched manually curated physical interactions i e they likely false negatives
MISC--: high confidence ap ms pin shows assortative mixing meaning proteins having similar numbers total interactions prefer interact each other
MISC--: consequence assortativity high degree proteins hubs prefer associate each other rather than proteins having very small numbers total interactions
AIMX--: agreement previous study citation we find consolidated y h pin shows weak disassortative mixing while manually curated set high confidence physical binary interactions displays both equal measure assortative disassortative mixing
OWNX--: therefore high quality ap ms data appear assortative while y h interaction data appear disassortative
OWNX--: we expect our scored yeast data sets ideal further investigations involving biological discovery our procedure will prove useful analysis current future ap ms data sets variety species
OWNX--: we compared our high quality ap ms interaction data sets those y h screens perceived number novel insights regarding their substances network properties
