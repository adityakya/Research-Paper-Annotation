MISC--: mechanisms stress tolerance sessile animals molluscs offer fundamental insights into adaptation organisms wide range environmental challenges
OWNX--: one best studied processes at molecular level relevant stress tolerance heat shock response genus mytilus
OWNX--: we focus upstream region mytilus galloprovincialis hsp genes their structural functional associations using comparative genomics network inference
MISC--: sequence comparison this region provides novel evidence transcription hsp regulated via dense region transcription factor binding sites also containing region similarity gamera family line like repetitive sequences genus specific element unknown function
OWNX--: furthermore we infer set gene networks tissue specific expression data specifically extract hsp class associated network genes associations exhibiting complex pattern expression across multiple tissue types
CONT--: our results suggest heat shock response genus mytilus regulated unexpectedly complex upstream region provide new directions use heat shock process biosensor system environmental monitoring
MISC--: majority molluscan species go through two principal developmental phases larval embryo followed clumping structure when they permanently attached underwater substrate
OWNX--: this lifecycle common amongst marine invertebrates poses challenges adaptation tolerance wide range conditions at littoral zone including steep salinity temperature gradients
MISC--: key model organisms molluscan biology include species genus mytilus particular m edulis m galloprovincialis m californianus
OWNX--: crucially latter species target organism genome sequencing project whose results eagerly expected community
MISC--: mytilus species group provides ideal model both fundamental questions animal adaptation stress response well biotechnological applications primarily pollution biosensor citation
MISC--: its use extends into biomimetics citation particular protein based medical adhesives citation potential applications fields dentistry citation
MISC--: moreover its relatively complex developmental structure higher taxonomic status invertebrate combined fact suffer mussel haemic neoplasia renders this organism potential model human leukemia ideal biomarker pollution induced disease citation
MISC--: this context important understand mechanisms mussels tolerate cope environmental stress given their behavioral options highly restricted due sessile phase their lifecycle
MISC--: past comparisons between motility sessility higher organisms been primarily confined animals versus plants citation follow up studies focusing comparisons between large animals e g humans versus large plants e g trees trade offs tree body plan citation
MISC--: less attention been paid adaptations sessile animals particular intertidal invertebrates citation citation molecular mechanisms through they achieve tolerance stress
MISC--: one exception represented heat shock response key factor temperature adaptation been studied this context certain extent citation specifically mytilus regard hsp citation hsp citation genes
MISC--: transcriptional regulation achieved either extensive repertoire paralogs transcription factors complex structure promoters
MISC--: analysis comprehensive datasets clearly demonstrated transcription factors transcription associated proteins not universally distributed but highly taxon specific relative tf gene content increases taxonomic scale citation citation
MISC--: comparisons been later extended follow up studies analyzed tap complements their expansion rates plants citation citation
MISC--: thus now known one way plants sessile organisms par excellence achieve finer degree regulation expansion tf tap complements gene content strategy
MISC--: yet unclear whether similar trends followed sessile animals since entire genome sequences those lacking so far limiting range comparative genome wide studies performed
MISC--: far paralogs concerned recent studies focused heat shock response plants particular arabidopsis thaliana revealed process involves up known tfs four heat shock protein families citation citation
MISC--: despite cursory resemblance mammals drosophila thermal sensing achieved unique repertoire genes citation including thermostat systems not exclusively involving heat shock proteins citation
OWNX--: other words probably different reasons gene content strategy might prevail both model organisms plants motile invertebrates
OWNX--: thus worth examining what mechanisms through stress response regulated sessile marine invertebrates general mytilus genus particular strategy dominates gene expression
AIMX--: we focus hsp family case study stress response sessile animals examine structure function hsp upstream region m galloprovincialis
MISC--: previously two distinct hsp genes same genomic organization been isolated m galloprovincialis citation herein called mghsp genes
OWNX--: detailed sequence analysis revealed two genes contain nine exons exhibit great similarities both non coding coding regions but differ their non coding regions well three introns due presence repeated sequences citation
MISC--: non coding region both genes contains non translated exon multiple binding sites various transcription factors highly suggestive potential interactions factors hsp promoter subtle patterns gene regulation citation
OWNX--: comparative analysis hsp gene content across all taxa available sequence data clearly shown invertebrate genomes contain relatively small number hsp genes compared those vertebrates citation
MISC--: thus appears mytilus genome might contain relatively small number tfs hsp genes raising question how expression hsp other heat shock genes regulated sessile invertebrates
AIMX--: present work we perform detailed analysis mghsp upstream region terms structure expression reveal presence previously undetected sequence elements unknown function
OWNX--: based tissue specific expression data we also delineate potential associations mghsp another genes involved complex pattern expression across tissues
MISC--: two discoveries discussed within context existing knowledge expected contribute towards deeper understanding heat shock response sessile organisms
