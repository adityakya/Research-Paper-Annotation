MISC--: accumulating infections highly pathogenic h n avian influenza humans underlines need track ability viruses spread among humans
MISC--: human transmissible avian influenza virus expected cause clusters infections humans living close contact
MISC--: therefore epidemiological analysis infection clusters human households key importance
OWNX--: infection clusters may arise transmission events animal reservoir humans who were infected animals humans who were infected humans
OWNX--: here we propose method analysing household infection data detect changes transmissibility avian influenza viruses humans at early stage
MISC--: method applied outbreak h n avian influenza virus netherlands was cause more than human human transmission events
MISC--: analyses indicate secondary human human transmission plausible dutch household infection data
OWNX--: based estimates within household transmission parameters we evaluate effectiveness antiviral prophylaxis conclude unlikely all household infections prevented current antiviral drugs
OWNX--: we discuss applicability our method detection emerging human human transmission avian influenza viruses particular analysis within household infection data general
MISC--: outbreaks highly pathogenic h n avian influenza southeast asia europe africa devastating consequences poultry citation citation resulted numerous infections humans citation citation
MISC--: although infections animal reservoir continue accumulate virus does not seem spread extensively among humans
MISC--: nevertheless fear human infections may ultimately spark influenza pandemic citation citation
MISC--: indeed recent clusters infections human households hint at possibility virus transmission humans who were infected poultry their household contacts citation citation
MISC--: suggestions strengthened observation mutations recent h n viruses seem predispose virus more efficient transmission mammals including humans citation citation
MISC--: likely virus pandemic potential will present itself initially through increase number infections humans who been close contact case infected animals
MISC--: therefore rapid detection control clusters infections key importance citation citation
OWNX--: clusters may result multiple introductions animal reservoir multiple transmission events humans who were infected animals multiple transmission events humans who were themselves infected humans
MISC--: obviously evidence most worrisome indicates virus acquired ability spread efficiently humans
MISC--: often thought pathogens animal reservoir made jump new host species usually not well adapted sustained transmission new host transmissibility new species will gradually increase over time process adaptation means natural selection citation citation
CONT--: interestingly however case h n avian influenza humans evidence so far does not seem fit this prediction citation citation
MISC--: mechanisms could responsible lack efficient secondary human human transmission could due dose effect whereby humans infected animals receive higher infection dose than humans infected humans behavioural changes after infection limit spread virus after been detected
AIMX--: this paper we develop method detect quantify different routes virus transmission household setting
OWNX--: our main aim investigate whether within household pathogen transmission been restricted transmission primary infected individual whether there evidence transmission chain extended beyond first generation human human infections
MISC--: our analyses based theoretical developments distribution final size epidemic finite populations allow construction flexible methods analyse within household transmission chains
OWNX--: we apply method recent study within household transmission highly pathogenic avian influenza h n subtype caused large epidemic poultry netherlands
MISC--: shortly after detection virus circulation dutch authorities undertook aggressive control strategy consisted animal movement ban affected regions tracing screening suspected flocks culling infected contiguous flocks
MISC--: all total flocks became infected during period nine weeks more than million birds were culled citation citation
MISC--: subsequent studies poultry workers revealed at least infections animal reservoir humans had taken place citation citation
OWNX--: addition more than household contacts infected poultry workers who had not been direct contact poultry were reported positive
MISC--: reports indicate human human transmission did occur individuals infected animal reservoir
MISC--: here we analyse data transmission chains households led human human transmission events measuring extent onward transmission humans who were infected humans
MISC--: we complement statistical analyses systematic power analyses obtain insight into study size needed able find significant secondary human human transmission given present
OWNX--: although we applied method specific dataset we believe our method general interest enables rapid estimation within household transmission rates based data easily gathered most infectious diseases
OWNX--: instance our method analysis not restricted analysis emerging pandemic influenza but just well used estimate different routes within household transmission rates human influenza viruses citation citation importantly assess potential effectiveness control measures
