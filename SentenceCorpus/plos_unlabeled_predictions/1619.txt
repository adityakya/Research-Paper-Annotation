MISC--: non intermingling adjacent populations cells define compartment boundaries boundaries often essential positioning maintenance tissue organizers during growth
MISC--: developing wing primordium drosophila melanogaster signaling secreted protein hedgehog required compartment boundary maintenance
MISC--: however precise mechanism hh input remains poorly understood
MISC--: here we combine experimental observations perturbed hh signaling computer simulations cellular behavior connect physical properties cells their hh signaling status
OWNX--: we find experimental disruption hh signaling observable effects cell sorting surprisingly far compartment boundary contrast previous model confines hh influence compartment boundary itself
OWNX--: we recapitulated our experimental observations simulations hh diffusion transduction coupled mechanical tension along cell cell contact surfaces
OWNX--: intriguingly best results were obtained under assumption hh signaling cannot alter overall tension force cell but will merely re distribute locally inside cell relative signaling status neighboring cells
OWNX--: our results suggest scenario homotypic interactions putative hh target molecule at cell surface converted into mechanical force
MISC--: scenario could explain why mechanical output hh signaling appears confined compartment boundary despite longer range hh molecule itself
OWNX--: our study first couple cellular vertex model describing mechanical properties cells growing tissue explicit model entire signaling pathway including freely diffusible component
OWNX--: we discuss potential applications challenges approach
MISC--: during embryonic development complex multicellular organisms spatial reference points need established within tissues
MISC--: often formed specialized groups cells capable signaling neighboring cells
MISC--: signaling centers define coordinate systems along newly arising cells orient themselves make crucial decisions regarding proliferation differentiation migration citation citation citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: because their pervasive importance tissue organizing centers need precisely controlled both spatially temporally well respect their signaling amplitude
OWNX--: one possible mechanism spatial control tissue organizers restrict movement cells at fixed boundary positions
MISC--: this phenomenon indeed observed involves separation groups cells already been spatially instructed assume distinct identities example at segment parasegment boundaries
MISC--: akin water oil two cell populations seen establish maintain relatively straight interface each other effectively minimizing their contact area
OWNX--: minimizing force assumed help stabilize interface against random perturbations may arise cell divisions arbitrary cell movements thus any organizing activity associated interface likewise stabilized
MISC--: how this separation sorting cells distinct identities achieved
MISC--: one line work attributes this differential cell adhesion citation citation cell populations might develop distinct adhesive properties affinity differences would then allow them sort out one another
MISC--: another line reasoning based differential interfacial tension citation citation this hypothesis suggests cells might actively constrict surfaces contact neighboring cells depending cellular identity neighbors depending signaling events
OWNX--: both mechanisms would ultimately lead physical forces would help keep cell populations apart
MISC--: developing wing primordium drosophila particularly well suited study boundary formation
OWNX--: not required larval viability manipulated experimentally through advanced genetic toolkit been well characterized
OWNX--: disc contains compartment boundary separates anterior posterior cells this boundary inherited specification events occurring early embryo
MISC--: initial embryonic events give rise boundary involve mutual signaling between stripes cells mediated extensively studied network genes
MISC--: once established cellular identities both sides boundaries stable throughout larval development well into adult life
MISC--: compartment boundary disc strictly respected all cells even when cells one side boundary artificially provided competitive growth advantage over cells other side boundary citation
MISC--: wing disc itself simple flat epithelial sheet orientations cell divisions appear largely random citation
MISC--: genetic analysis computational modeling this tissue simplified fact daughter cells arising cell divisions usually remain physical contact do not migrate away each other
MISC--: this been shown experimentally tracing descendents single cells most cases clone offspring cells will form coherent patch connected cells
OWNX--: this behavior suggests complicated processes cell intercalation migration neglected first approximation when studying boundary maintenance this tissue
OWNX--: working wing discs recent seminal study begun shed light possible boundary formation mechanisms citation
OWNX--: authors directly demonstrated increased mechanical tension at cell cell interfaces located immediately at boundary using laser ablation experiments
MISC--: subsequent computer simulations then revealed collectively local forces sufficient maintain stable compartment boundary
MISC--: results intriguing but they raise number new questions boundary formation wing disc known depend secreted diffusible signaling protein hedgehog produced posterior cells specifically sensed transduced anterior cells citation citation
MISC--: if diffusible hh indeed somehow influences mechanical tension what conditions must then met ensure well defined boundary
OWNX--: so far all known transcriptional responses hh signaling occurring several cell diameters wide into responding tissue
MISC--: how response this case restricted immediate boundary region
MISC--: furthermore experimental suppression hh signaling been shown lead ectopic boundary formation distant actual boundary citation
MISC--: does this mean influence hh signaling does extend beyond actual boundary if so why does this not noticeable consequence wild type situation
AIMX--: here we propose mechanistic model generate localized outcome hh signaling respect physical forces mechanical properties despite longer range molecular response terms target gene expression
OWNX--: furthermore we estimate distance boundary up hh signaling may able prime cells boundary formation this distance inferred using both experimental results well modeling results we estimate at least cell diameters
OWNX--: we approach problem first formulating explicit two dimensional model hh production diffusion transduction then coupling this setup physical model growing tissue
OWNX--: our modeling approach cells their contact surfaces described graph connected vertexes
BASE--: our model essentially follows differential interface tension hypothesis modified version model been previously established very same tissue citation
