MISC--: acquisition analysis datasets including multi level omics physiology non model species sampled field populations formidable challenge so far prevented application systems biology approaches
MISC--: if successful could contribute enormously improving our understanding how populations living organisms adapt environmental stressors relating example pollution climate
MISC--: here we describe first application network inference approach integrating transcriptional metabolic phenotypic information representative wild populations european flounder fish sampled at seven estuarine locations northern europe different degrees profiles chemical contaminants
OWNX--: we identified network modules whose activity was predictive environmental exposure represented link between molecular morphometric indices
MISC--: sub networks represented both known candidate novel adverse outcome pathways representative several aspects human liver pathophysiology liver hyperplasia fibrosis hepatocellular carcinoma
OWNX--: at molecular level pathways were linked tnf alpha tgf beta pdgf agt vegf signalling
OWNX--: more generally this pioneering study important implications applied model molecular mechanisms compensatory adaptation wide range scenarios wild populations
MISC--: modelling responses compensatory adaptations living organisms changing environment extremely important both terms scientific understanding its potential impact global health
MISC--: although computational modelling ecological systems been utilised ecotoxicology application systems biology approaches non model organisms general presents formidable difficulties partly due limited sequence information environmentally relevant sentinel species
MISC--: moreover number samples depth information available often limited there may lack truly relevant physiological endpoints
MISC--: thus omics proven effective finding responses aquatic organisms model toxicants laboratory based experiments citation but environment poses greater challenge anthropogenic contaminants present complex mixtures responses will additionally dependent upon natural life history traits other environmental factors
MISC--: relatively few omics studies focussed upon ecotoxicology environmentally sampled fish citation citation
BASE--: although we previously shown citation citation expression stress response genes could used distinguish fish environmental sampling sites different underlying contaminant burdens this gave little insight health outcomes molecular differences
OWNX--: this context identifying molecular mechanisms compensatory toxic responses observational data approach been so successful clinical studies laboratory model organisms highly challenging field studies
OWNX--: we addressed this challenge developing novel network inference strategy based integration multi level measurements populations fish exposed diverse spectrum environmental pollutants
AIMX--: this provides useful model network biology approach generally applicable non model species represents breakthrough way we study mechanisms whereby organisms respond chemical exposure environment
OWNX--: we directed our efforts towards modelling molecular networks representative populations flatfish european flounder sampled marine environments north western europe including locations significantly impacted anthropogenic chemical contaminants
MISC--: study integrated measurements representing broad spectrum samples characterized using transcriptomics metabolomics conventional biomarkers analysis chemicals sediments sampling sites
MISC--: previous studies shown both anthropogenic contamination higher prevalence pre neoplastic neoplastic lesions flounder elbe estuary citation mersey tyne citation together elevated levels hepatic dna adducts at sites citation
MISC--: data integration was achieved implementing systems biology framework network reconstruction starting cross species mapping sequence information integration multi level datasets within framework network inference citation culminating identification network modules predictive physiological responses chemical exposure valuable marine monitoring citation
OWNX--: networks we identified demonstrate remarkable parallel between human liver carcinogenesis environmental effects fish liver well revealing potentially novel adaptation mechanisms
MISC--: broader application network biology approaches other non model species sampled environment therefore likely profoundly change our understanding how living systems likely adapt complex environments
