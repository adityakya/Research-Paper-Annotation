OWNX--: we used multi round two party exchange game healthy subject played subject diagnosed dsm iv disorder applied bayesian clustering approach behavior exhibited healthy subject
MISC--: goal was characterize quantitatively style play elicited healthy subject their dsm diagnosed partner
OWNX--: approach exploits dynamics behavior elicited healthy proposer biosensor cognitive features characterize psychopathology group at other side interaction
MISC--: using large cohort subjects we found statistically significant clustering proposers behavior overlapping range dsm iv disorders including autism spectrum disorder borderline personality disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder major depressive disorder
OWNX--: further validate results we developed computer agent replace human subject proposer role show also detect same four dsm defined disorders
OWNX--: results suggest highly developed social sensitivities humans bring two party social exchange exploited automated detect important psychopathologies using interpersonal behavioral probe not directly related defining diagnostic criteria
MISC--: social interactions among humans reflect execution some most important complex behavioral software humans endowed
AIMX--: consequently we should expect computations involved human social exchange subtle perhaps even difficult expose study controlled settings
OWNX--: however exposing computations crucial if we improve our characterization understanding normal human cognitive function dysfunction
MISC--: recent years components social exchange healthy subjects been probed using interactive economic exchange games citation citation
OWNX--: games typically involve two subjects interacting one multiple rounds through exchange monetary gestures one another
OWNX--: our purposes here games require three classes computation intact functioning minds interacting subjects
MISC--: they require each subject compute norms what fair each exchange detect deviations monetary gestures deviate norms choose actions predicated deviations citation citation
OWNX--: experimental probes been used previously area behavioral economics neuroeconomics but here we show behavioral gestures elicited context economic exchange games used classify certain psychopathologies
OWNX--: twist our effort here we use data driven approach examining reactions healthy partner kind biosensor while playing exchange game subject possessing psychopathology
