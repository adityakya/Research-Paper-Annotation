OWNX--: nucleoside analogs used antiretroviral treatment been associated mitochondrial toxicity
OWNX--: polymerase hypothesis states this toxicity stems analogs inhibition mitochondrial dna polymerase leading mitochondrial dna depletion
OWNX--: we constructed computational model interaction polymerase activated nucleoside nucleotide analog drugs based experimentally measured reaction rates base excision rates together mtdna genome size human mtdna sequence mitochondrial dntp concentrations
MISC--: model predicts approximately fold difference activated drug concentration required percent probability mtdna strand termination between activated di deoxy analogs d t ddc ddi activated forms analogs tc tdf azt ftc abc
MISC--: predictions supported experimental clinical data showing significantly greater mtdna depletion cell culture patient samples caused di deoxy analog drugs
OWNX--: zidovudine we calculated very low mtdna replication termination probability contrast its reported mitochondrial toxicity vitro clinically
MISC--: therefore azt mitochondrial toxicity likely due mechanism does not involve strand termination mtdna replication
MISC--: current guidelines highly active anti retroviral treatment regimens hiv positive patients recommend two drugs nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class citation
MISC--: this class currently consists stavudine lamivudine zidovudine zalcitabine didanosine abacavir emtricitabine tenofovir
MISC--: though zalcitabine at time this writing still technically approved treatment its distribution united states was discontinued roche
MISC--: their activated tri phosphorylated forms each nrti acts nucleotide analog interacting hiv viral reverse transcriptase alternative substrate natural nucleotides citation citation
MISC--: each analogs lacks oh group necessary incorporation next nucleotide thereby terminating viral dna strand elongation
MISC--: although nrtis effective drugs helped usher hiv into category controllable chronic disease they also often toxic inducing side effects lactic acidosis neuropathy nausea lypodistrophy myopathy patients
MISC--: intolerance side effects common reason treatment discontinuation citation
MISC--: any decrease patient compliance treatment regimen serious concern lead increase viral resistance ultimately treatment failure
OWNX--: first step ameliorating side effects preventing them future antiviral treatments understand mechanisms behind mitochondrial toxicity nrtis use today
OWNX--: we discuss below many mechanisms mitochondrial toxicity been proposed
AIMX--: this paper we specifically consider plausibility currently most widely accepted hypothesis toxicity mechanism this class drugs interference mitochondrial dna replication activated drug
MISC--: polymerase only polymerase responsible mitochondrial dna replication
OWNX--: while pol not believed directly regulate mtdna levels pathogenic mutations gene polg do affect stability mtdna cause mtdna depletion citation
MISC--: polymorphisms found polg gene human population may cause natural variability activity this complex enzyme may conceivably play role patient variability nrti drug toxicities
MISC--: study conducted martin et al citation approved nrtis were shown inhibit various host dna polymerases
OWNX--: after hiv reverse transcriptase highest affinity nrtis was polymerase
MISC--: this along fact many nrti side effects resemble symptoms mitochondrial genetic disorders implicated interaction polymerase subsequent depletion mtdna potential cause nrti toxicity giving rise polymerase hypothesis citation
MISC--: indeed experiments demonstrated decreased mtdna amounts various tissue types nrti treated hiv positive patients citation citation
MISC--: addition mtdna depletion was observed parallel cell death mitochondrial morphological changes increased lactate production liver heart neuron skeletal muscle adipose blood cell cultures after incubation different nrtis citation citation
OWNX--: possible polymerase dependent toxicity mechanisms comprise polymerase hypothesis direct inhibition polymerase nrti triphosphate without incorporation into mtdna chain termination mtdna replication following incorporation nrti triphosphate incorporation analog triphosphate into mtdna without chain termination allowing nrti continue point mutation mtdna citation
MISC--: however there also exists substantial body data not consistent toxicity mechanisms resulting depletion mtdna
MISC--: martin et al citation showed no association between inhibition polymerase nrtis mtdna depletion
OWNX--: mitochondrial dysfunction been observed vitro mouse muscle white adipose brain liver heart tissue citation hepatoma cell lines citation well cd cells citation after incubation nrtis although no significant decrease mtdna amount was observed
MISC--: particularly incubation liver skeletal muscle cells ddc ddi d t azt show higher rate lactate production presence azt but least amount mtdna depletion citation citation
MISC--: clinical settings mtdna depletion been seen parallel normal cytochrome c oxidase activity sign correct mitochondrial function citation was not associated lipoatrophy citation
MISC--: taken together findings indicate weak relationship between mtdna copy number nucleoside analog toxicity
OWNX--: this warrants deeper look at data concerning interaction different nrtis polymerase
OWNX--: this end we simulated dna replication process mitochondria
MISC--: using enzyme kinetics data gathered johnson et al citation feng et al citation hanes et al citation citation we carried out series simulations mtdna replication presence various nucleoside analogs interact polymerase
MISC--: simulations bridge gap between basic enzyme kinetics data probability failure mtdna replication process
