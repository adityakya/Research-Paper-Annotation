OWNX--: calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii plays key role induction long term postsynaptic modifications following calcium entry
MISC--: experiments suggest long term synaptic changes all none switch like events between discrete states
MISC--: biochemical network involving camkii its regulating protein signaling cascade been hypothesized durably maintain evoked synaptic state form bistable switch
MISC--: however still unclear whether experimental ltp ltd protocols lead corresponding transitions between two states realistic models network
OWNX--: we present detailed biochemical model camkii autophosphorylation protein signaling cascade governing camkii dephosphorylation
OWNX--: previously shown two stable states camkii phosphorylation level exist at resting intracellular calcium concentration high calcium transients switch system weakly phosphorylated highly phosphorylated state camkii
OWNX--: we show here increased camkii dephosphorylation activity at intermediate ca concentrations lead switching up down state
MISC--: this achieved if protein phosphatase activity promoting camkii dephosphorylation activates at lower ca levels than kinase activity
MISC--: finally shown camkii system qualitatively reproduce results plasticity outcomes response spike timing dependent plasticity presynaptic stimulation protocols
MISC--: this shows camkii protein network account both induction through ltp ltd like transitions storage due its bistability synaptic changes
MISC--: synaptic plasticity thought underlie learning memory but mechanisms changes synaptic efficacy induced maintained over time still unclear
MISC--: numerous experiments shown how synaptic efficacy increased decreased spike timing presynaptic postsynaptic neurons citation citation presynaptic firing rate citation citation presynaptic firing paired postsynaptic holding potential citation
MISC--: experiments led phenomenological models capture one several aspects citation citation
MISC--: however models tell us nothing about biochemical mechanisms induction maintenance synaptic changes
MISC--: question mechanisms at biochemical level been addressed another line research work originating early work lisman citation
MISC--: models at biochemical level describe enzymatic reactions proteins postsynaptic density citation citation
MISC--: proteins form network positive feedback loops potentially provide synapse several stable states two simplest case providing means maintain evoked changes
OWNX--: hence synapses models similar binary switches exhibiting two stable states up state high efficacy down state low efficacy
MISC--: idea binary synapses supported recent experiments ca ca synapses citation citation
MISC--: one proposed positive feedback loops involves calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii kinase phosphatase system citation citation
MISC--: camkii activation governed ca calmodulin binding prolonged beyond fast decaying calcium transients its autophosphorylation citation
OWNX--: autophosphorylation camkii at residue theronine autoregulatory domain occurs after calcium calmodulin binding enables enzyme remain autonomously active after dissociation calcium calmodulin citation
MISC--: turn long camkii stays activated reversibly translocated postsynaptic density bound state where interacts multiple ltp related partners structurally organizing protein anchoring assemblies therefore potentially delivering amino hydroxyl methyl isoxazole propionate acid receptors cell surface citation citation citation
MISC--: direct phosphorylation ampa receptor glur subunit active camkii enhances ampa channel function citation citation
MISC--: network involving camkii particularly appealing terms learning memory maintenance since n methyl d aspartate receptor dependent ltp requires calcium calmodulin activation camkii potentially expressed phosphorylation level number ampa receptors both citation citation citation citation citation
MISC--: however role camkii beyond ltp induction remains controversial citation citation
MISC--: finally there experimental evidence involvement proteins associated camkii activity calcineurin ltp ltd citation citation
AIMX--: we emphasize multiple mechanisms supporting ltp ltd induction expression likely present synapses different regions we focus here synapses above statements been shown apply e g ca ca schaffer collateral synapse
MISC--: modeling studies shown system including camkii associated pathways could bistable range calcium concentrations including resting level necessary requirement maintenance long term changes citation citation citation citation
MISC--: models two states correspond two stable phosphorylation levels camkii protein given calcium concentration i e weakly highly phosphorylated state
MISC--: transition down up state could underlie long term potentiation induced sufficiently large prolonged increase calcium concentration
OWNX--: however opposite transition could underlie depotentiation ltd only occurs under unrealistic conditions example decrease calcium concentration below resting level
MISC--: furthermore not been considered how biochemical network models behave response calcium transients evoked experimental protocols known induce synaptic plasticity stdp been shown rely kinase phosphatase activation citation
MISC--: rubin et al reproduce experimental results stdp using model detector system qualitatively resembles protein network influencing camkii but this model does not exhibit bistability citation
MISC--: other studies biochemical signal transduction pathways including camkii showed ampa receptor activity reproduce bidirectional synaptic plasticity function calcium citation citation
CONT--: however realistic stimulation protocols were not investigated models again they do not show bistability
AIMX--: this paper we consider realistic model protein interactions associated camkii autophosphorylation through calcium calmodulin dephosphorylation protein phosphatase psd
OWNX--: we first study steady state phosphorylation properties camkii respect calcium changing levels pp activity
MISC--: conditions elaborated system allows ltp ltd transitions reasonable ranges calcium concentrations
OWNX--: we then demonstrate ability camkii system perform ltp ltd like transitions response stdp stimulation protocols
CONT--: we expose camkii system calcium transients evoked pairs presynaptic postsynaptic spikes given time lag show short positive time lags evoke transitions down up state short negative time lags lead transitions up down state
OWNX--: we demonstrate furthermore camkii model qualitatively reproduces experimental plasticity outcomes presynaptic stimulation protocols
OWNX--: finally we consider transition behavior response purely presynaptic postsynaptic spike pair stimulation protocols
