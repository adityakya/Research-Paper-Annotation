MISC--: text mining algorithms make mistakes extracting facts natural language texts
MISC--: biomedical applications rely use text mined data critical assess quality individual facts resolve data conflicts inconsistencies
MISC--: using large set almost manually produced evaluations we implemented tested collection algorithms mimic human evaluation facts provided automated information extraction system
OWNX--: performance our best automated classifiers closely approached our human evaluators
OWNX--: our hypothesis were we use larger number human experts evaluate any given sentence we could implement artificial intelligence curator would perform classification job at least accurately average individual human evaluator
OWNX--: we illustrated our analysis visualizing predicted accuracy text mined relations involving term cocaine
MISC--: information extraction uses computer aided methods recover structure meaning locked natural language texts
OWNX--: assertions uncovered this way amenable computational processing approximates human reasoning
MISC--: special case biomedical applications texts represented books research articles extracted meaning comprises diverse classes facts relations between molecules cells anatomical structures maladies
MISC--: unfortunately current tools information extraction produce imperfect noisy results
MISC--: although even imperfect results useful highly desirable most applications ability rank text derived facts confidence quality their extraction
OWNX--: we focus automatically extracted statements about molecular interactions small molecule binds protein b protein b activates gene c protein d phosphorylates small molecule e
MISC--: several earlier studies examined aspects evaluating quality text mined facts
MISC--: example sekimizu et al ono et al attempted attribute different confidence values different verbs associated extracted relations activate regulate inhibit citation citation
MISC--: thomas et al proposed attach quality value each extracted statement about molecular interactions citation although researchers did not implement suggested scoring system practice
MISC--: independent study citation blaschke valencia used word distances between biological terms given sentence indicator precision extracted facts
BASE--: our present analysis we applied several machine learning techniques large training set manually evaluated examples design tool mimics work human curator who manually cleans output information extraction program
OWNX--: our goal design tool used any information extraction system developed molecular biology
OWNX--: this study our training data came geneways project thus our approach biased toward relationships captured specific system
OWNX--: we believe spectrum relationships represented geneways ontology sufficiently broad our results will prove useful other information extraction projects
OWNX--: our approach followed path supervised machine learning
OWNX--: first we generated large training set facts were originally gathered our information extraction system then manually labeled correct incorrect team human curators
OWNX--: second we used battery machine learning tools imitate computationally work human evaluators
AIMX--: third we split training set into ten parts so we could evaluate significance performance differences among several competing machine learning approaches
