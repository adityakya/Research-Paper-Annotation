MISC--: dendrite morphology neuron s anatomical fingerprint neuroscientist s asset unveiling organizational principles brain
MISC--: however genetic program encoding morphological identity single dendrite remains mystery
OWNX--: order obtain formal understanding dendritic branching we studied distributions morphological parameters group four individually identifiable neurons fly visual system
OWNX--: we found parameters relating branching topology were similar throughout all cells
OWNX--: only parameters relating area covered dendrite were cell type specific
OWNX--: areas artificial dendrites were grown based optimization principles minimizing amount wiring maximizing synaptic democracy
OWNX--: although same branching rule was used all cells this yielded dendritic structures virtually indistinguishable their real counterparts
OWNX--: principles we derived fully automated model based neuron reconstruction procedure validating artificial branching rule
OWNX--: conclusion we suggest genetic program implementing neuronal branching could constant all cells whereas one responsible dendrite spanning field should cell specific
MISC--: dendrite morphology most prominent feature nerve cells typically used neuroanatomists discriminate classify them citation
MISC--: tree like ramifications represent input region neurons fulfil role complex computational unit citation citation
MISC--: typically dendritic arborizations analyzed descriptive way e g enumerating local global branching parameters citation citation
MISC--: very little known about general rule leading their distinct appearance partly due wide variety among different neurons
MISC--: insects same neurons across individuals rather invariant their anatomy constant their function
MISC--: lobula plate tangential cells fly visual system citation uniquely identifiable therefore ideal subjects investigating basic rule constraining dendrite formation
MISC--: they integrate local motion information over array retinotopically arranged columnar elements citation
MISC--: accordingly their planar dendritic trees cover area corresponding their distinct primary receptive fields
AIMX--: this paper we isolate potential fundamental principles may lead morphological identity individual lptcs
