OWNX--: retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens identify genes involved tumor development mice yielded substantial number retroviral integration sites this number expected grow substantially due introduction high throughput screening techniques
OWNX--: data various retroviral insertional mutagenesis screens compiled publicly available retroviral tagged cancer gene database
OWNX--: integrally analyzing screens presence common insertion sites requires approach corrects increased probability finding false ciss amount available data increases
MISC--: moreover significance estimates ciss should established taking into account both noise arising random nature insertion process well bias stemming preferential insertion sites present genome data retrieval methodology
OWNX--: we introduce framework kernel convolution framework find ciss noisy biased environment using predefined significance level while controlling family wise error
CONT--: where previous methods use one two three predetermined fixed scales our method capable operating at any biologically relevant scale
OWNX--: this creates possibility analyze ciss scale space varying width ciss providing new insights behavior ciss across multiple scales
OWNX--: our method also features possibility including models background bias
OWNX--: using simulated data we evaluate kc framework using three kernel functions gaussian triangular rectangular kernel function
OWNX--: we applied gaussian kc data combined set screens rtcgd found percent ciss do not reach significance threshold this combined setting
OWNX--: still fwe under control application our method resulted discovery eight novel ciss each probability less than percent being false detections
MISC--: retroviral insertional mutagenesis experiments genes involved development cancer identified determining loci viral insertions tumors induced retroviruses mice citation citation
OWNX--: after infecting host cell retrovirus inserts its own dna into host cell s genome mutating host cell s dna process
MISC--: mutation may alter expression genes vicinity insertion when inserted within gene alter gene product
OWNX--: when affected gene cancer gene activation proto oncogene inactivation tumor suppressor gene cause uncontrolled proliferation cells
MISC--: eventually this may give rise tumors
MISC--: throughout this text cancer causing insertions referred oncogenic insertions
MISC--: tumor develops when accumulation oncogenic insertions causes uncontrolled proliferation cell
MISC--: result tumor tissue contains many copies cell bearing oncogenic insertions induced proliferation but only few copies cells carrying non oncogenic insertions
MISC--: consequently when dna tumor analyzed one will encounter insertion induced proliferation larger proportions than insertions do not
MISC--: regions genome found carry insertions multiple independent tumors called common insertion sites
MISC--: result locations ciss highly correlated location genes involved tumor development
MISC--: cloning flanking sequences inserted virus determine insertion loci analyzing data find significant ciss therefore enable discovery new candidate cancer genes
OWNX--: this summarized figure s
