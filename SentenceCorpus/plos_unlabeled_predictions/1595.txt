MISC--: neural field model presented captures essential non linear characteristics activity dynamics across several millimeters visual cortex response local flashed moving stimuli
OWNX--: we account physiological data obtained voltage sensitive dye imaging reports mesoscopic population activity at high spatio temporal resolution
MISC--: stimulation included single flashed square single flashed bar line motion paradigm psychophysical studies showed flashing square briefly before bar produces sensation illusory motion within bar moving squares controls
OWNX--: we consider two layer neural field model describing excitatory inhibitory layer neurons coupled system non linear integro differential equations
OWNX--: under assumption aggregated activity both layers reflected vsd imaging our phenomenological model quantitatively accounts observed spatio temporal activity patterns
MISC--: moreover model generalizes novel similar stimuli matches activity evoked moving squares different speeds
OWNX--: our results indicate feedback higher brain areas not required produce motion patterns case illusory line motion paradigm
MISC--: physiological interpretation model suggests considerable fraction vsd signal may due inhibitory activity supporting notion balanced intra layer cortical interactions between inhibitory excitatory populations play major role shaping dynamic stimulus representations early visual cortex
OWNX--: visual cortical activity does not exclusively mirror visual input but rather reflects contribution additional recurrent processes involving lateral local feedback couplings
OWNX--: understanding cortical processing requires theoretical understanding underlying activity dynamics attained modeling at various levels abstraction
OWNX--: naturally chosen level should match level at neuronal recordings made citation
OWNX--: activity patterns observed using voltage sensitive dye imaging reflect population activity at mesoscopic level citation citation
OWNX--: this suggests application mean field models large numbers neurons averaged
OWNX--: moreover we interested relation neuronal dynamics spatial dimensions cortical sheet
BASE--: neural field models citation citation citation efficacy synaptic coupling depends notion distance between neurons ensembles neurons therefore our preferred choice
OWNX--: here we show minimalistic multiple layer nf models simulate mean vsd data space time high accuracy
OWNX--: model abstract functional description vsd recorded dynamics
OWNX--: thus first place phenomenological
MISC--: however its interpretation biological terms allows link its structure parameters neuronal functional architecture
OWNX--: imaging data we model showed two stationary stimuli presented rapid succession produce pattern signals propagation activity across bar s retinotopic representation early visual cortex
MISC--: ii obtained pattern was different activity when bar was flashed alone did not match simple superposition activities evoked individually presented square bar stimuli
OWNX--: iii rather we observed propagation wave front activity was also found when square stimulus moved physically visual space citation
OWNX--: based vsd imaging data citation we hypothesized two layer neural field citation citation model account findings i iii
MISC--: if so this would imply feedback higher brain areas not principal requirement produce motion patterns across primary visual cortex upon presentation square bar flashed rapid succession
MISC--: voltage sensitive dye imaging measures relative fluorescence changes linearly correlated changes membrane potentials citation citation
OWNX--: this technique currently allows recording vivo cortical activity at sub well suprathreshold level at least ms temporal resolution spatial resolution formulam across several millimeters cortex
CONT--: hence well suited capture real time dynamics millions neurons at once
MISC--: however signal does not distinguish between excitatory inhibitory contributions overall activity
OWNX--: therefore our model explicitly assumes vsd signal reflects mixture activity excitatory inhibitory neuronal populations thus contrasts studies interpret vsd data mainly reflecting excitatory activity
OWNX--: we expect gain insights about relative contributions excitatory inhibitory activities vsd signal because model allows separate inspection its inhibitory excitatory layers
OWNX--: following we first describe underlying data its preprocessing our model structure our parameter identification procedure
