MISC--: protein point mutations essential component evolutionary experimental analysis protein structure function
MISC--: while many manually curated databases attempt index point mutations most experimentally generated point mutations biological impacts changes described peer reviewed published literature
OWNX--: we describe application mutation grab identifies extracts verifies point mutations biomedical literature
MISC--: principal problem point mutation extraction link point mutation its associated protein organism origin
OWNX--: our algorithm uses graph based bigram traversal identify relevant associations exploits swiss prot protein database verify this information
MISC--: graph bigram method different other models point mutation extraction incorporates frequency positional data all terms article drive point mutation protein association
OWNX--: our method was tested articles describing point mutations g protein coupled receptor tyrosine kinase ion channel protein families
OWNX--: we evaluated our graph bigram metric against word proximity metric term association datasets full text literature three different protein families
CONT--: our testing shows graph bigram metric achieves higher f measure gpcrs protein tyrosine kinases ion channel transporters
MISC--: importantly situations where more than one protein assigned point mutation disambiguation required graph bigram metric achieves precision compared word distance metric precision
OWNX--: we believe graph bigram search metric significant improvement over previous search metrics point mutation extraction applicable text mining application requiring association words
MISC--: advent ultra high throughput screening high density array technology biological community come appreciate value unbiased surveys complex biological systems
MISC--: bioinformatics tools become integral part analysis extensive datasets
MISC--: when complex data collected centrally analysis straightforward
OWNX--: when data collected distributed fashion investigators must agree centralized data deposition strategy we must develop tools interrogate published literature extract relevant information
MISC--: manually curated online databases developed meet this need but they difficult maintain scale
MISC--: accordingly biological text mining field evolved identify extract information literature database storage access
MISC--: two types tasks predominate biological text mining extraction gene protein names citation citation extraction interactions between proteins citation citation
MISC--: biocreative challenge was citation focused name extraction citation additional task functional annotation citation
MISC--: other text mining applications focus hypothesis generation citation probing protein subcellular localization citation pathway discovery citation
MISC--: recent work also focused extraction protein point mutations biomedical literature citation citation
MISC--: protein point mutations substitution wild type amino acid alternate one important our understanding protein function evolutionary relationships genetic disorders
MISC--: functional perspective researchers introduce point mutations into proteins assay importance particular residue protein function
MISC--: evolution relies upon mutations polymorphisms dna mechanism creating diversity protein sequences
OWNX--: while term mutation used imply deleterious changes polymorphism means difference within species text mining purposes we refer point mutation substitution different amino acid reference amino acid
MISC--: dbsnp citation human gene mutation database citation two many databases catalog point mutations their downstream effects
MISC--: databases manually curated limits speed input into database breadth information represented but does aid incorporation complex information difficult text mining tools parse
MISC--: task point mutation extraction decomposed into two subtasks
MISC--: first necessary identify protein mutation terms discussed within article
MISC--: after entities identified association must made between point mutation its correct protein origin
AIMX--: this problem trivial when paper discusses single protein but increasingly complex when multiple proteins present
OWNX--: our evaluation mutation graph bigram we downloaded full text pdf articles related gpcr tyrosine kinase ion channel protein families pubmed provided links
OWNX--: using our dictionary based protein term identification method we counted articles out total contained point mutation could belonged multiple proteins
MISC--: few methods point mutation extraction been developed
MISC--: rebholz schuhmann et al citation describe method called mema scans medline abstracts mutations
MISC--: baker witte citation citation describe method called mutation miner integrates point mutation extraction into protein structure visualization application
MISC--: our own group presented mutext citation point mutation extraction method applied g protein coupled receptor nuclear hormone receptor literature
MISC--: mema mutext use straightforward dictionary search identify protein gene names word proximity distance measurement disambiguate between multiple protein terms
OWNX--: both methods while providing simple successful method point mutation extraction were limited two areas
MISC--: first word distance measurement not always correct disambiguating between protein terms
MISC--: second mema was evaluated set abstracts intrinsically more limited than full text article
OWNX--: our literature set abstracts contained only percent point mutations found full text
MISC--: point mutations were also validated against omim citation only contains disease related point mutations
MISC--: mutext was trained evaluated gpcr intranuclear hormone receptor literature contained customizations algorithm dealing problematic protein naming amino acid numbering cases
MISC--: mutation miner approaches problem differently
OWNX--: this method identifies relates proteins organisms point mutations using nlp analysis at sentence level
MISC--: entity pair assigned if both entities match noun phrase patterns
OWNX--: this method would work well if all point mutations were described conjunction associated proteins organisms at sentence level we observed not always case
MISC--: mutation miner also incorporates protein sequence information but use annotating protein d structures mutation information instead point mutation validation
MISC--: our method improves mema mutext mutation miner using novel graph bigram metric incorporates frequency location terms disambiguate between proteins searches full text information
MISC--: like mutext mutation grab utilizes swiss prot protein database citation sequence validation intrinsically contains more sequence variation than omim
OWNX--: we addressed utility our application standardizing algorithm all protein families evaluating our method three different protein family literature sets covering articles
OWNX--: more detailed comparisons mema mutation miner described discussion section
MISC--: our task associating point mutations protein terms not sufficient minimally tag protein name literature we must also find its correct gene identifier corresponding database
MISC--: biocreative challenge addressed this problem b subtask identifying protein gene mentioned text annotating its correct gene identifier
MISC--: solutions this challenge ranged rule based methods citation machine learning approaches citation combination both
CONT--: unfortunately some methods may not applicable our point mutation extraction task
MISC--: participants biocreative challenge were provided large set annotated sentences categorized under three different organisms human yeast fly
MISC--: some solutions subtask b consisted learning training data each organism then applying learned functions test set also divided organism
OWNX--: this approach suboptimal our task two reasons
MISC--: first because point mutations frequently analyzed at protein family superfamily level methods trained protein names organism specific lexicons would not well suited analysis across many species
OWNX--: second our goal create broadly applicable methodology point mutation extraction utilized any categorization proteins
MISC--: machine learning approaches benefit large detailed annotated training sets
MISC--: our experience manual labor involved annotating amount text necessary learn protein family specific nomenclature scale presented biocreative likely undermine benefits automated point mutation extraction
MISC--: methods relying solely rule based features protein name identification generally perform at lower precision recall than methods incorporating machine learning
MISC--: however since rule based methods do not necessarily require annotated training data they advantageous when data unavailable difficult acquire
MISC--: our approach protein term identification similar other rule based approaches citation citation citation
MISC--: we first create dictionary using names synonyms proteins protein family protein names retrieved their respective swiss prot entrezgene entries
MISC--: terms dictionary then searched journal literature
OWNX--: depending character length composition terms we search different regular expressions varying levels specificity
OWNX--: further description this detailed methods section
