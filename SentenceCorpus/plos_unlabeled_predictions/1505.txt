MISC--: development systemic approaches biology put emphasis identifying genetic modules whose behavior modeled accurately so gain insight into their structure function
CONT--: however most gene circuits cell under control external signals thus quantitative agreement between experimental data mathematical model difficult
MISC--: circadian biology been one notable exception quantitative models internal clock orchestrates biological processes over hour diurnal cycle been constructed few organisms cyanobacteria plants mammals
MISC--: most cases complex architecture interlocked feedback loops been evidenced
OWNX--: here we present first modeling results circadian clock green unicellular alga ostreococcus tauri
MISC--: two plant like clock genes been shown play central role ostreococcus clock
OWNX--: we find their expression time profiles accurately reproduced minimal model two gene transcriptional feedback loop
MISC--: remarkably best adjustment data recorded under light dark alternation obtained when assuming oscillator not coupled diurnal cycle
MISC--: this suggests coupling light confined specific time intervals no dynamical effect when oscillator entrained diurnal cycle
MISC--: this intringuing property may reflect strategy minimize impact fluctuations daylight intensity core circadian oscillator type perturbation been rarely considered when assessing robustness circadian clocks
MISC--: real time monitoring gene activity now allow us unravel complex dynamical behavior regulatory networks underlying cell functions citation
MISC--: however understanding collective behavior even few molecular actors defies intuition depends not only topology interaction network but also strengths response times its links citation
MISC--: mathematical description regulatory network thus necessary qualitatively quantitatively understand its dynamical behavior but obtaining challenging
MISC--: state variables parameters subject large fluctuations citation create artificial complexity mask actual network structure
MISC--: genetic modules usually not isolated but coupled larger network given gene involved different modules pathways citation
OWNX--: thus important identify gene circuits whose dynamical behavior modeled quantitatively serve model circuits
MISC--: one strategy obtaining circuits been construct synthetic networks isolated design citation citation
MISC--: recent experiments shown excellent quantitative agreement obtained incorporating when needed detailed descriptions various biochemical processes citation
OWNX--: another strategy study natural gene circuits whose function makes them relatively autonomous stable
MISC--: circadian clocks drive biological processes around day night cycle many living organisms natural candidates genetic oscillators keep track most regular environmental constraint alternation daylight darkness caused earth rotation citation citation
MISC--: informed experiments circadian clock models progressively become more complex evolving single loops featuring self repressed gene citation citation networks interlocked feedback loops citation citation
AIMX--: here we report surprisingly good agreement between mathematical model single transcriptional feedback loop expression profiles two central clock genes ostreococcus tauri
MISC--: this microscopic green alga smallest free living eukaryote known date belongs prasinophyceae one most ancient groups green lineage
MISC--: ostreococcus displays very simple cellular organization only one mitochondrion one chloroplast citation citation
MISC--: its small genome sequence revealed high compaction very low gene redundancy citation
MISC--: cell division cycle ostreococcus under control circadian oscillator cell division occurring at end day light dark cycles citation
MISC--: daily rhythms cell division meet criteria characterizing circadian clock they entrained different photoperiods persist under constant conditions respond light pulses phase shifts depend internal time citation
MISC--: very recently some light been shed molecular workings ostreococcus clock corellou et al citation
MISC--: since clock closely related arabidopsis been extensively studied they searched ostreococcus genome orthologs higher plant clock genes found only two similar arabidopsis central clock genes toc cca citation
OWNX--: two genes display rhythmic expression both under light dark alternation constant light conditions
OWNX--: functional analysis overexpression antisense strategy showed toc cca important clock genes ostreococcus
OWNX--: overexpression toc led increased levels cca while overexpression cca resulted lower levels toc
MISC--: furthermore cca was shown bind conserved evening element sequence required circadian regulated activity toc promoter
MISC--: whether toc cca work negative feedback loop could not inferred this study since ostreococcus clock appeared rely more than simple toc cca negative feedback loop
OWNX--: interestingly arabidopsis genes toc cca were core actors first plant clock model based transcriptional loop where toc activates cca similar gene lhy whose proteins dimerize repress toc citation citation
CONT--: however this model did not reproduce well expression peaks toc cca arabidopsis citation was extended adjust experimental data citation
MISC--: current arabidopsis clock models feature several interlocked feedback loops citation citation
MISC--: this led us investigate whether transcriptional feedback loop model where toc activates cca repressed cca would relevant ostreococcus
OWNX--: we not only found this two gene loop model reproduces perfectly transcript profiles ostreococcus toc cca but excellent adjustment data recorded under light dark alternation obtained when no model parameter depends light intensity
CONT--: this counterintuitive finding suggests oscillator not permanently coupled light across hour cycle but only during specific time intervals supported numerical simulations
OWNX--: this article we propose invisibility coupling entrainment conditions reflects strategy shield oscillator natural fluctuations daylight intensity
