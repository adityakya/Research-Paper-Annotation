MISC--: natural proteins often partake several highly specific protein protein interactions
MISC--: they thus subject multiple opposing forces during evolutionary selection
OWNX--: functional multispecific proteins need stable complex each interaction partner at same time maintain affinity toward all partners
OWNX--: how this multispecificity acquired through natural evolution
AIMX--: answer this compelling question we study prototypical multispecific protein calmodulin evolved interact hundreds target proteins
OWNX--: starting high resolution structures sixteen cam target complexes we employ state art computational methods predict hundred cam sequences best suited interaction each individual cam target
OWNX--: then we design cam sequences most compatible each possible combination two three all sixteen targets simultaneously producing almost low energy cam sequences
OWNX--: comparing sequences their energies we gain insight into how nature managed find compromise between need favorable interaction energies need multispecificity
OWNX--: we observe designing more partners simultaneously yields cam sequences better match natural sequence profiles thus emphasizing importance strategies nature
OWNX--: furthermore we show cam binding interface nicely partitioned into positions critical affinity all cam target complexes those molded provide interaction specificity
OWNX--: we reveal several basic categories sequence level tradeoffs enable compromise necessary promiscuity this protein
OWNX--: we also thoroughly quantify tradeoff between interaction energetics multispecificity find facilitating seemingly competing interactions requires only small deviation optimal energies
OWNX--: we conclude multispecific proteins been subjected rigorous optimization process fine tuned their sequences interactions precise set targets thus conferring their multiple cellular functions

MISC--: proteins interact large number partners play central role modular organization protein interaction networks citation
MISC--: proteins usually referred protein hubs tend more essential than others cell survival citation usually exhibit slower rates evolution citation
OWNX--: moreover comprehensive biological activity proteins typically requires them recognize precise set targets specific way

MISC--: proteins diverse binding capacity also been termed multispecific proteins citation citation
MISC--: central function multispecific proteins within interaction networks imposes constraints their amino acid sequences especially their protein protein interfaces i e regions used mediate intermolecular interactions various targets

MISC--: remarkably cam targets display considerable variability sequence structure
MISC--: cam binding regions within target proteins generally rich hydrophobic positively charged residues

MISC--: this affinity reduced at least fold absence formula allowing quick dissociation cam its targets when formula depleted
MISC--: multitude binding constraints placed cam during evolution likely produced sequence may not optimal binding any particular cam target but rather presents compromise essential interaction large number partners
OWNX--: this study we employ computational design approach citation understand how compromises required functional promiscuity citation achieved both level amino acid sequences level binding energetics
OWNX--: first we computationally evolve cam interact single targets second we evolve this protein bind multiple partners simultaneously
