MISC--: changes synaptic connection strengths between neurons believed play role memory formation
OWNX--: important mechanism changing synaptic strength through movement neurotransmitter receptors regulatory proteins synapse
MISC--: several activity triggered biochemical events control movements
AIMX--: here we use computer models explore how putative memory related changes stabilised long after initial trigger beyond lifetime synaptic molecules
OWNX--: we base our models published biochemical data experiments activity dependent movement glutamate receptor ampar calcium dependent kinase camkii
OWNX--: we find both molecules participate distinct bistable switches
OWNX--: simulated switches effective long periods despite molecular turnover biochemical fluctuations arising small numbers molecules synapse
MISC--: ampar switch arises novel self recruitment process where presence sufficient receptors biases receptor movement cycle insert still more receptors into synapse
MISC--: camkii switch arises autophosphorylation kinase
MISC--: switches may function tightly coupled manner relatively independently
OWNX--: latter case leads multiple stable states synapse
AIMX--: we propose similar self recruitment cycles may important maintaining levels many molecules undergo regulated movement may lead combinatorial possible stable states systems like synapse
MISC--: long term storage neuronal information believed occur through alterations synaptic efficacy
MISC--: many mechanisms been identified changes synaptic strength including modulation neurotransmitter release conductivity changes receptors changes numbers receptors active synapses structural alterations synapse
MISC--: among insertion glutamate receptors alpha amino hydroxy methyl isoxazole propionate subtype into postsynaptic membrane modulation receptor conductance phosphorylation key events modulating synaptic efficacy
OWNX--: fundamental issue challenges all mechanisms how they last lifetime
OWNX--: synaptic memories decay at least three ways turnover diffusive exchange stochasticity
MISC--: turnover major postsynaptic molecules ranges periods few minutes few days may further enhanced synaptic activity citation
MISC--: one solution loss memory due molecular turnover concept self sustaining molecular switches citation
MISC--: typically involve some form molecular feedback giving rise chemical systems stably settle into one two states
MISC--: two state bistable systems store information binary manner
MISC--: provided there steady supply replacement molecules molecular turnover tolerated since newly synthesised na ve molecules become entrained current state system
MISC--: some current proposals bistable synaptic switches include calcium calmodulin type ii kinase hypothesis citation mitogen activated protein kinase feedback loop citation citation recently mammalian target rapamycin protein synthesis loop citation
MISC--: camkii model been posed most detail most complete structural correlates
MISC--: according this model camkii at synapse undergo autophosphorylation leads activation kinase
MISC--: activated kinase molecules catalyze phosphorylation yet more camkii molecules resulting self sustaining cycle
OWNX--: mapk feedback loop model also involves self sustaining cycle but this case several intermediate molecules participate loop
MISC--: protein synthesis loop model based observation local protein translation machinery associated synapses
MISC--: messenger rna several proteins including ribosomes themselves also present
OWNX--: thus high local protein synthesis creates machinery maintaining high levels synthesis
MISC--: this protein synthetic loop regulated mtor
OWNX--: second mechanism decay synaptic memory diffusive exchange synaptic proteins leading washout specific states synapse
MISC--: extrapolations free diffusion constants suggest diffusive exchange between synaptic spine dendrite likely rapid under s even proteins citation
MISC--: postsynaptic density elaborate cytoskeletal signalling complex provides anchors synaptic proteins close region presynaptic neurotransmitter release
MISC--: this anchoring solves problem free diffusion washout active molecules but introduces problem regulating insertion molecules into correct locations
MISC--: there considerable evidence targeted trafficking molecules psd
MISC--: one trafficking cycle insertion removal glutamate receptors ampa subtype into synaptic membrane citation
MISC--: striking physiologically important example receptor insertion conversion silent synapses lacking ampa receptors into active synapses full complement receptors
OWNX--: delivery ampars synaptic membrane involves two streams constitutive pathway involving glutamate receptor heteromers activity dependent pathway involving glur citation
MISC--: based current evidence activity dependent insertion glur into synaptic membrane stimulated phosphorylation ser citation citation
MISC--: there also evidence phosphorylation being implicated synaptic plasticity citation citation
MISC--: camkii also translocates psd upon calmodulin binding stimulation citation
MISC--: thus addition their known involvement synaptic plasticity ampars camkii mechanisms activity dependent recruitment psd manner acts counter washout processes citation
OWNX--: this combination attributes makes molecules interesting candidates analysing molecular memory mechanisms
MISC--: nevertheless over long term even anchoring events reversible additional processes must considered stability
MISC--: third important obstacle stable memory formation biochemical stochasticity
OWNX--: this causes uncertainty outcome biochemical reactions involving small numbers molecules
MISC--: fluctuations severe at synapse where many important signalling molecules present low numbers less than molecules
MISC--: typical synaptic volume fl citation there estimated five free ca ions
MISC--: under stochastic conditions there finite probability spontaneous state flips bistable molecular switches citation citation
MISC--: lifetime stable states depends both reaction rates number molecules
MISC--: example proposed mapk switch does not fare well synaptic volumes spontaneously flips state time scale minutes citation
OWNX--: nevertheless time estimates highly dependent assumptions about diffusion anchoring levels noise other synaptic pathways
CONT--: putting themes together plausible synaptic memory mechanism might look like bistable molecular switch resistant turnover incorporates traffic molecules psd unlikely spontaneously flip state even when small synaptic molecule numbers taken into account
AIMX--: this study we report novel glutamate receptor based switch emerges consideration its traffic satisfies criteria
OWNX--: we also examine possible camkii switch context criteria
OWNX--: finally we integrate switches explore how multiple synaptic states may arise citation
