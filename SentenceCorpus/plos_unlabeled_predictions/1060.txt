MISC--: pitch one most important features natural sounds underlying perception melody music prosody speech
OWNX--: however temporal dynamics pitch processing still poorly understood
MISC--: previous studies suggest auditory system uses wide range time scales integrate pitch related information effective integration time both task stimulus dependent
OWNX--: none existing models pitch processing account task stimulus dependent variations processing time scales
OWNX--: this study presents idealized neurocomputational model provides unified account multiple time scales observed pitch perception
CONT--: model evaluated using range perceptual studies not previously been accounted single model new results neurophysiological experiment
OWNX--: contrast other approaches current model contains hierarchy integration stages uses feedback adapt effective time scales processing at each stage response changes input stimulus
OWNX--: model features common hierarchical generative process suggests key role efferent connections central sub cortical areas controlling temporal dynamics pitch processing
OWNX--: modelling neural processing pitch essential understanding perceptual phenomenology music speech
MISC--: pitch one most important features auditory perception usually associated periodicities sounds citation
MISC--: hence number models pitch perception based upon temporal analysis neural activity evoked stimulus citation citation
MISC--: most models compute form short term autocorrelation simulated auditory nerve activity using exponentially weighted integration time window citation citation
MISC--: autocorrelation models been able predict reported pitches wide range complex stimuli
CONT--: however choosing appropriate integration time window been problematic none previous models been able explain wide range time scales encountered perceptual data unified fashion
MISC--: data show certain conditions auditory system capable integrating pitch related information over time scales several hundred milliseconds citation citation while at same time being able follow changes pitch pitch strength resolution only few milliseconds citation citation citation citation
MISC--: limits temporal resolution pitch perception also been explored determining pitch detection discrimination performance function frequency modulation rate citation citation main conclusion being auditory system limited ability process rapid variations pitch
OWNX--: trade off between temporal integration resolution not exclusive pitch perception but general characteristic auditory temporal processing
MISC--: instance long integration time several hundred milliseconds required explain way detectability perceived loudness sounds increases increasing sound duration citation citation
MISC--: contrast much shorter integration times necessary explain fact auditory system resolve sound events separated only few milliseconds citation citation
OWNX--: therefore appears integration time auditory processing varies stimulus task
OWNX--: previously was proposed integration resolution reflect processing separate parallel streams different stimulus independent integration times citation
CONT--: more recently order reconcile perceptual data pertaining temporal integration resolution tasks was suggested auditory system makes its decisions based multiple looks at stimulus citation using relatively short time windows
CONT--: however our knowledge no model yet quantitatively explained stimulus task dependency integration time constants
MISC--: another major challenge pitch modelling relate perceptual phenomena neurophysiological data
MISC--: functional brain imaging studies strongly suggest pitch processed hierarchical manner citation starting sub cortical structures citation continuing up through heschl s gyrus planum polare planum temporale citation citation
MISC--: within this processing hierarchy there increasing dispersion response latency lower pitches eliciting longer response latencies than higher pitches citation
MISC--: this suggests time window over auditory system integrates pitch related information depends pitch itself
CONT--: however no attempt yet been made explain this latency dispersion
OWNX--: this study we present unified account multiple time scales involved pitch processing
OWNX--: we suggest top down modulation within hierarchical processing structure important explaining stimulus dependency effective integration time extracting pitch information
MISC--: highly idealized model formulated terms interacting neural ensembles presented
MISC--: model represents natural extension previous autocorrelation models pitch form resembling hierarchical generative process citation citation higher levels modulate responses lower levels via feedback connections
OWNX--: without modification model account not only wide range perceptual data but also novel neurophysiological data pitch processing
