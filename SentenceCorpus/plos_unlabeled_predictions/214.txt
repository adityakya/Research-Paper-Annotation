MISC--: deleterious mutations considered major impediment adaptation there straightforward expectations rate at they accumulate function population size mutation rate
OWNX--: simulation model evolving population asexually replicating rna molecules initially deleterious mutations accumulated at rates nearly equal initially beneficial mutations without impeding evolutionary progress
MISC--: mutation rate was increased within moderate range deleterious mutation accumulation mean fitness improvement both increased
OWNX--: fixation rates were higher than predicted many population genetic models
MISC--: this seemingly paradoxical result was resolved part observation during time fixation selection coefficient initially deleterious mutations reversed confer selective advantage
MISC--: significantly more than half fixations initially deleterious mutations involved fitness reversals
MISC--: fitness reversals had substantial effect total fitness genome thus contributed its success population
OWNX--: despite relative importance fitness reversals however probabilities fixation both initially beneficial initially deleterious mutations were exceedingly small
MISC--: modern evolutionary theory recognizes deleterious mutations may reduce fitness retard adaptation citation citation
MISC--: accumulation deleterious mutations expected affect rate course many biological processes sexual selection development cancer senescence citation
MISC--: theoretical work underlying predictions makes important assumption fitness effect deleterious mutation constant until mutation disappears fixes
MISC--: standard infinite population experiencing combination natural selection random mutation deleterious mutations should not fix but accumulate level perfectly balanced mutation selection
MISC--: some processes lead deleterious mutations fixing infinite populations however
MISC--: example eigen s quasispecies model high rates mutation overwhelm selection shift mutation selection balance deleterious mutations accumulate exceedingly high levels citation citation
MISC--: finite populations several processes may also allow deleterious mutation fixation citation
OWNX--: best studied random genetic drift stochastic fixation deleterious mutations relatively small populations
MISC--: additionally if recombination rare population size finite then deleterious mutations hitchhike fixation independently acting beneficial mutations citation citation
MISC--: fixation deleterious mutations certainly reduces fitness populations
MISC--: may possible however fitness effect initially deleterious mutation change over time
MISC--: particular compensatory mutations may evolve reduce negative impact deleterious mutations extreme cases resulting fitness may even higher than fitness ancestor deleterious mutation arose citation
MISC--: compensatory mutations may appear before deleterious mutation fixed
MISC--: metaphorically speaking while fixed deleterious mutations generally expected bad they may stepping stones distant adaptive peaks
MISC--: evolutionary geneticists long considered mutations ameliorate compensate deleterious effect prior mutation
MISC--: literature this subject however focuses almost exclusively compensatory mutations occurring after fixation initial deleterious mutation therefore does not address likelihood initial mutation will fix first place citation citation
MISC--: one possible explanation this emphasis convenience both mathematical experimental
MISC--: greatly simplify evolutionary dynamics population genetic models adaptation typically assume selection much stronger than mutation strong selection weak mutation
MISC--: under this assumption deleterious mutation will disappear fix before secondary mutations arise genome thus fitness effect deleterious mutation remains unchanged throughout its evolutionary trajectory either fixation loss citation
MISC--: if mutation rate relatively large however additional mutations may arise genome carrying initially deleterious mutation before fixes lost
MISC--: secondary mutations change genetic background thus potentially change fitness effect initial deleterious mutation
MISC--: background selection literature frequently considered scenario good mutation driven extinction bad mutations
OWNX--: our interest however process involving epistasis between mutations results amelioration deleterious effect ultimately fixation initially bad mutation
CONT--: although this process seems been largely ignored population genetics literature one notable study kimura shows mutations at two linked alleles singly deleterious but jointly neutral both fix relatively rapidly even large populations citation
MISC--: there also been recent interest ability populations escape local optima via less fit intermediate genotypes
AIMX--: here we use computational model asexually replicating rna molecules study fixation deleterious mutations
OWNX--: we first observe initially deleterious mutations fix at far greater rate than expected evolving asexual population some populations achieve high mean fitness despite rapidly accumulating deleterious mutations
OWNX--: we then reconcile this paradox systematically characterizing processes leading fixation include random genetic drift hitchhiking upon independently acting beneficial mutations fitness effect reversals upon secondary mutations
