MISC--: while many models biological object recognition share common set broad stroke properties performance any one model depends strongly choice parameters particular instantiation model e g number units per layer size pooling kernels exponents normalization operations etc since number parameters typically large computational cost evaluating one particular parameter set high space possible model instantiations goes largely unexplored
