MISC--: quasispecies clouds genotypes appear population at mutation selection balance
MISC--: this concept recently attracted attention virologists because many rna viruses appear generate high levels genetic variation may enhance evolution drug resistance immune escape
MISC--: literature important evolutionary processes however quite challenging
MISC--: here we use simple models link mutation selection balance theory most novel property quasispecies error threshold mutation rate below populations equilibrate traditional mutation selection balance above population experiences error catastrophe loss favored genotype through frequent deleterious mutations
MISC--: models show single fitness landscape may contain multiple hierarchically organized error thresholds error threshold affected extent back mutation redundancy genotype phenotype map
OWNX--: importantly error threshold distinct extinction threshold complete loss population through lethal mutations
OWNX--: based this framework we argue lethal mutagenesis viral infection mutation inducing drugs not true error catastophe but extinction catastrophe
MISC--: concept mutation selection balance one oldest most fundamental pillars population genetics natural selection increases frequency fit variants while mutations introduce unfit variants giving rise equilibrium distribution balanced between two effects
MISC--: mutation selection balance been invoked explain persistence undesirable genes example those underlying inbreeding depression genetic diseases even senescence
MISC--: despite long history concept some its consequences were only realized when manfred eigen studied mutation selection dynamics long genomes citation
MISC--: he found populations do not necessarily attain classic mutation selection balances wild type allele most common but rather attain equilibrium abundant assemblage mutant genotypes rare wild type
MISC--: he peter schuster later called this collection genotypes at equilibrium quasispecies citation
MISC--: this concept offered not only intuitive extension mutation selection theory based simple one two locus systems but also novel insight into impact mutation rate evolutionary dynamics
MISC--: particular eigen found there states trivial boost mutation rate lead fundamental change composition genotypes population
MISC--: this change phase transition physics terms called error catastrophe
MISC--: error catastrophe been applied liberally metaphor complications high mutation rates likely plagued primordial life citation currently challenges extant viruses rna genomes citation
MISC--: error catastrophe model inspired treatments extirpate viral populations mutation enhancement citation citation model been generalized explain attraction populations mutationally robust regions fitness landscapes citation
MISC--: error catastrophe imparted mystique quasispecies concept much literature rna virus evolution now uses quasispecies enriched synonym high mutation rate
MISC--: excellent short review topic its relationship population genetics theory provided wilke citation
OWNX--: eigen s insights were developed context genomes many loci each suffered mutation
MISC--: appropriately quasispecies since been considered this large genome context
MISC--: yet many its concepts easily illustrated much simpler case few genotypes our approach here
OWNX--: our results not new per se but our models should convey quasispecies error catastrophe concepts broad audience correct some common misunderstandings
