MISC--: finding functional dna binding sites transcription factors throughout genome crucial step understanding transcriptional regulation
MISC--: unfortunately binding sites typically short degenerate posing significant statistical challenge many more matches known tf motifs occur genome than actually functional
MISC--: however information about chromatin structure may help identify functional sites
MISC--: particular been shown active regulatory regions usually depleted nucleosomes thereby enabling tfs bind dna those regions
OWNX--: here we describe novel motif discovery algorithm employs informative prior over dna sequence positions based discriminative view nucleosome occupancy
OWNX--: when gibbs sampling algorithm applied yeast sequence sets identified chip chip correct motif found percent more cases our informative prior than commonly used uniform prior
OWNX--: this first demonstration nucleosome occupancy information used improve motif discovery
OWNX--: improvement dramatic even though we using only statistical model predict nucleosome occupancy we expect our results improve further high resolution genome wide experimental nucleosome occupancy data becomes increasingly available
MISC--: finding functional dna binding sites transcription factors throughout genome necessary step understanding transcriptional regulation
MISC--: however despite explosion tf binding data high throughput technologies like chip chip dip chip citation pbm citation gene expression arrays finding functional occurrences binding sites tfs remains difficult problem because binding sites most tfs short degenerate sequences occur frequently genome chance
MISC--: particular matches known tf motifs genome often do not appear bound respective tfs vivo
OWNX--: one popular explanation this when dna form chromatin not all parts dna equally accessible tfs
MISC--: this state dna wrapped around histone octamers forming nucleosomes
MISC--: positioning nucleosomes along dna believed provide mechanism differential access tfs at potential binding sites
MISC--: indeed been shown functional binding sites tfs at regulatory regions typically depleted nucleosomes vivo citation citation
OWNX--: if we knew precise positions nucleosomes throughout genome under various conditions we could increase specificity motif finders restricting search functional binding sites nucleosome free areas
MISC--: here we describe method incorporating nucleosome positioning information into motif discovery algorithms constructing informative priors biased toward less occupied promoter positions
OWNX--: our method should improve motif discovery most when access high resolution nucleosome occupancy data gathered under various vivo conditions
OWNX--: unfortunately this data not currently available any organism at whole genome scale let alone under variety conditions
OWNX--: nevertheless because our method probabilistic even noisy evidence regarding nucleosome positioning effectively exploited
MISC--: example segal et al citation recently published computational model based high quality experimental nucleosome binding data predicts probability each nucleotide position yeast genome being bound nucleosome predictions intrinsic dna sequence thus independent condition but were purported explain around half nucleosome positions observed vivo
MISC--: addition lee et al citation used chip chip profile average nucleosome occupancy each yeast intergenic region
OWNX--: we show informative positional priors whether learned computational occupancy predictions low resolution average occupancy data significantly outperform not only commonly used uniform positional prior but also state art motif discovery programs
