MISC--: accessibility multiple structures resolved given protein different forms now possible identify principal changes structure assumed given protein upon binding different ligands observed conform those intrinsically accessible protein prior ligand binding citation citation
OWNX--: observations suggest dominance proteins intrinsic dynamics defining modes interactions ligands
MISC--: this contrast induced fit model citation where ligand induces change conformation
MISC--: instead monod wyman changeux citation model allostery where selection amongst those conformers already accessible triggered upon ligand binding
AIMX--: yet choice between intrinsic vs induced dynamics correlations between dynamics function still established presumably depend particular systems study citation

MISC--: paramount importance this respect clear understanding collective motions their relationship binding catalytic activities if any toward gaining deeper insights into functional mechanisms shared members protein families
MISC--: protein dynamics explored means all atom force fields simulations coarse grained models methods
MISC--: all atom simulations molecular dynamics describe conformational fluctuations system over broad range timescales
MISC--: except small proteins main limitation md timescales computationally attainable do not allow accurate sampling slow large amplitude motions usually biological interest

MISC--: ecnagk homodimer residues each monomer being folded into sandwich
MISC--: n domain each subunit monomer makes intersubunit contacts hosts nag binding site whereas c domain binds atp
MISC--: phosphoryl transfer reaction takes place at interface between two domains within each subunit
CONT--: kinetic studies show no evidence cooperativity between subunits citation suggesting dimeric structure provides thermodynamic stability only monomeric fold been evolutionary selected perform catalytic function
MISC--: diverse crystallographic structures solved bound state this enzyme indicate two types functional motions citation x ray structures ecnagk complexed either adp inert atp analogue amppnp too narrow active site let substrates bind directly whereas unbound structure more open active site
OWNX--: this suggests enzyme undergoes conformational closure likely triggered upon nucleotide binding since all complexes display closed structure whether nag bound not
OWNX--: ternary complex adp nag displays ability exchange nag sulphate ion solution without opening active site
