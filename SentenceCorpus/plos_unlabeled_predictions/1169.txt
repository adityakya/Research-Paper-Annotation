OWNX--: here we use minimal model combines cell extrinsic cell intrinsic elements regulation order understand how both instructive stochastic events inform cell commitment decisions hematopoiesis
MISC--: our results suggest cytokine mediated positive receptor feedback induce switch like response external stimuli during multilineage differentiation providing robustness both bipotent committed states while protecting progenitors noise induced differentiation decommitment
OWNX--: our model provides support both instructive stochastic theories commitment cell fates ultimately driven lineage specific transcription factors but cytokine signaling strongly bias lineage commitment regulating inherently noisy cell fate decisions complex pertinent behaviors ligand mediated ultrasensitivity robust multistability
OWNX--: simulations further suggest kinetics differentiation mature cell state depend starting progenitor state well route commitment chosen
OWNX--: lastly our model shows good agreement lineage specific receptor expression kinetics microarray experiments provides computational framework integrate both classical alternative commitment paths hematopoiesis been observed experimentally

OWNX--: exact molecular events direct lineage commitment at stem cell stage at multipotent progenitor level remain elusive but well appreciated lineage specific transcription factors cytokine receptors play critical roles
MISC--: lineage specific transcription factors been identified master regulators commitment differentiation
MISC--: they drive expression pertinent lineage specific genes thereby initiating phenotypic change progenitor cell down specific differentiation path citation citation
MISC--: developmental potency multipotent progenitor reflected co expression multiple lineage specific transcription factors at low levels phenomenon known transcriptional priming citation
MISC--: this promiscuous gene expression pattern progenitor cell necessitates during cell differentiation specific transcription factor upregulated chiefly positive autoregulation citation citation other lineage transcription factors downregulated primarily through cross antagonism citation citation
MISC--: addition lineage specific transcription factors cell differentiation also believed tightly regulated cytokines
MISC--: cytokines signal via their cognate receptors whose cytoplasmic domains activate various pathways involved survival proliferation differentiation citation citation
MISC--: been extensively debated whether cell fate during differentiation stochastic instructive process
MISC--: stochastic theory claims differential expression lineage specific transcription factors due intrinsic noise progenitor cells dictates commitment decision citation citation whereas instructive theory argues absolute dependence lineage specific cytokine receptor signals during differentiation shows cell fate decisions regulated extrinsic growth factor cues citation citation citation citation
MISC--: underlying question evoked both theories whether cytokines provide instructive cues select lineage committed progenitors providing permissive survival proliferation signals
