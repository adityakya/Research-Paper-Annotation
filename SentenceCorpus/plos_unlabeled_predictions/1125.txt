MISC--: at low speeds rotor moves springs relax but quickly restretched formula passage so system remains quasi equilibrium torque set pmf
MISC--: spring stretching may vary slightly among units but since there several motor units we assume instantaneous torque self averages nearly constant time
OWNX--: under this scenario steps cannot explained at level single pair mota b flig subunits but must arise at global level rotor stator interaction
