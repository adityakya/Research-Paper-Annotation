MISC--: understanding intracellular molecular machinery responsible complex collective behavior multicellular populations exigent problem modern biology
MISC--: quorum sensing allows bacteria activate genetic programs cooperatively provides instructive tractable example illuminating causal relationships between molecular organization gene networks complex phenotypes they control
BASE--: this work we our knowledge first time present detailed model population wide transition quorum sensing using example agrobacterium tumefaciens
OWNX--: we construct model describing ti plasmid quorum sensing gene network demonstrate behaves off gene expression switch robust molecular noise activates plasmid conjugation program response increase autoinducer concentration
MISC--: this intracellular model then incorporated into agent based stochastic population model also describes bacterial motion cell division chemical communication
OWNX--: simulating transition quorum sensing liquid medium biofilm we explain experimentally observed gradual manifestation quorum sensing phenotype showing transition individual model cells into state spread stochastically over broad range autoinducer concentrations
OWNX--: at same time population averaged values critical autoinducer concentration threshold population density shown robust variability between individual cells predictable specific particular growth conditions
OWNX--: our modeling approach connects intracellular population scales quorum sensing phenomenon provides plausible answers long standing questions regarding ecological evolutionary significance phenomenon
OWNX--: thus we demonstrate transition quorum sensing requires much higher threshold cell density liquid medium than biofilm this basis we hypothesize agrobacterium quorum sensing serves detector biofilm formation
MISC--: molecular networks integrate signal transduction gene expression into unified decision circuitry ultimately responsible realization all life activities biological cells including internal developmental programs responses environmental factors
MISC--: one main challenges systems biology uncover understand relationships between properties molecular circuits macroscopic cellular phenotypes controlled them citation
OWNX--: particularly important phenotypes involving interaction cooperative action multiple cells
MISC--: mapping networks onto phenotypes still difficult accomplish multicellular eukaryotic organisms owing their staggering complexity
MISC--: less complex more experimentally accessible prokaryotic organisms became systems choice dissecting social behavior at genetic level citation
MISC--: phenomenon bacterial quorum sensing gives us particularly unique opportunity follow causal relationships molecular circuitry cooperative population dynamics
MISC--: qs refers ability bacterial populations collectively activate certain gene expression programs e g toxin release antibiotic production once some critical population density been reached
MISC--: qs found vast variety bacterial species been extensively studied experimentally citation citation
MISC--: gram negative bacteria qs phenomenon usually controlled small gene expression network functions environmentally activated off gene expression switch citation citation whose operation analogous radar
OWNX--: at low cell density normally corresponds off switch state key transcription factor required expression proteins responsible phenotype suppressed
OWNX--: at same time cell steadily produces small amount qs signaling molecule termed autoinducer freely diffuse out cell
MISC--: while population density low most autoinducer molecules washed out dispersed environment diffusion
MISC--: cell density grows more molecules autoinducer enter bacterium outside
MISC--: once certain cell quorum reached inbound autoinducer signal triggers transition qs network state resulting production transcription factor expression target genes
OWNX--: this transition both intracellular population wide scales focus our study
OWNX--: we investigate phenomenon qs soil dwelling plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens causative agent crown gall disease citation
MISC--: bacteria this species often harbor ti plasmids endow their hosts unique ability genetically modify susceptible plants through cross kingdom dna transfer
MISC--: like many other soil bacteria agrobacterium chemotactic exudates released plant wounds capable catabolizing various nutrients leave injured plant roots
MISC--: once bacteria form physical contact surface wound ti plasmids offer their hosts extraordinary advantage over their plasmidless competitors
MISC--: fragment plasmid termed vir region injected into plant cell form virion like complex stably incorporated into plant genome citation
OWNX--: one imported genes responsible synthesis opines class low molecular weight nitrogen rich metabolites utilized nutrient only bacteria harbor ti plasmid
OWNX--: other transferred genes cause vigorous proliferation infected plant cells eventually results formation characteristic gall tumor
MISC--: once productive infection established ti plasmids attempt propagate themselves into plasmidless bacteria same related species means genetic conjugation
MISC--: been shown conjugal transfer ti plasmids requires qs phenomenon citation
MISC--: functional significance qs control ti plasmid conjugation remains ecological evolutionary puzzle
MISC--: widely believed citation citation qs controls processes production toxins antibiotics either inefficient devoid adaptive value if not performed population scale
MISC--: thus fact establishment qs upstream initiation conjugation seems imply plasmids await critical density donors collectively begin transfer recipients
OWNX--: since multiple donors cannot cooperate dna transfer necessity collective action does not seem relevant our case
MISC--: instead increase probability successful conjugation would appear beneficial exceed certain number recipients per donor
MISC--: however density plasmidless recipients cannot estimated using qs since they do not produce autoinducer
CONT--: this seemingly paradoxical situation may imply our understanding biological function qs not yet complete
MISC--: indeed alternative function qs sensor volume enclosing bacteria also been proposed citation
MISC--: answer what bacteria really measure using qs each particular situation necessary consider ecologically relevant conditions bacterial growth citation
MISC--: experimental approach this problem often complicated technical difficulty work real ecosystems
MISC--: other hand mathematical modeling significantly aid complement experimental methods answering biological questions involve spatial temporal scales qs phenomenon
MISC--: some aspects either intracellular citation citation population citation citation dynamics been mathematically modeled gain insight into qs phenomenon pseudomonas aeruginosa vibrio fischeri
MISC--: however because lack detailed molecular information experimentally testable conclusions connections between intracellular population dynamics rarely been made
OWNX--: here we develop multi level modeling approach describes both intracellular population wide dynamics allows us follow connections between them explicitly
MISC--: although much been learned about molecular details agrobacterium qs network not always clear what functions they perform
AIMX--: here we construct detailed model qs network agrobacterium analyze both quantitatively qualitatively
OWNX--: we demonstrate network possesses properties off gene expression switch robust molecular noise
OWNX--: we further develop population scale model incorporates bacterial motion cell division chemical communication while explicitly considering individual intracellular dynamics each cell
OWNX--: this allows us describe transition qs both cellular population scales quantitatively predict values critical autoinducer concentration threshold cell density functions various intracellular environmental parameters
OWNX--: finally comparing feasibility transition qs homogeneous medium biofilm we present hypothesis explaining ecological evolutionary roles qs regulation ti plasmid conjugal transfer
MISC--: all genes thought constitute qs network located ti plasmid itself citation
MISC--: entire qs network controlled upstream availability plant produced opines ensure energetically expensive conjugation machinery activated only after establishment successful plant wound infection
MISC--: based chemical nature encoded opines ti plasmids divided into two major types citation we consider only octopine type
MISC--: we reconstructed layout qs network octopine type ti plasmids published experimental data
MISC--: this plasmid class octopine molecules imported through cell wall eventually cause activation transcription operon occ citation
OWNX--: model we assume octopine constitutively available at saturating concentration results maximal rate occ transcription
MISC--: last open reading frame this operon codes qs transcription activator trar
MISC--: binding trar its cognate autoinducer thought occur only within narrow window time during trar mrna translation when newly formed protein chain tightly winds around single molecule agrobacterium autoinducer citation citation
OWNX--: this total engulfment aai molecule makes formation trar aai complex practically irreversible
MISC--: furthermore trar protein translated absence aai misfolded insoluble unable bind aai citation citation
MISC--: this important consequence rate production trar depends concentrations trar mrna aai does not depend accumulation misfolded trar protein explicitly shown figure
MISC--: once formed trar quickly dimerizes form stable transcriptionally active trar dimer relatively short half life min citation
MISC--: trard capable activating number operons encode proteins necessary conjugation
MISC--: first open reading frame trb operon codes acyl homoserine lactone synthetase trai utilizes two metabolites abundant bacterial cell create aai citation
OWNX--: since our model considers transition qs mostly nutrient rich stress free conditions optimized growth medium we assume substrates trai present excess their concentrations do not limit rate aai production
MISC--: both trar trai were shown expressed at some low constitutive rate even absence octopine citation
MISC--: trar trai couple constitutes classic qs positive feedback loop found many gram negative bacteria
MISC--: additional feedback loops also involve other components qs network specific agrobacterium
MISC--: thus negative control qs provided antiactivator tram whose transcription directly activated trard citation
MISC--: tram effectively sequesters trard through formation very stable complex trard unable bind dna citation citation
MISC--: recently number authors reported like trar tram also forms dimer citation citation
MISC--: stoichiometry reaction between trar tram however remains controversial citation citation
OWNX--: our model we follow original hypothesis swiderska et al citation assumes complex consists one trard one monomer tram
MISC--: this hypothesis partially supported chen et al citation who showed tram dimer must dissociate form complex trar
OWNX--: under assumptions we disregard dimerization tram not affecting network behavior
OWNX--: additional positive feedback loop arises because trard activates transcription msh operon suboperon occ contains trar itself
MISC--: several lines evidence suggest active transporters facilitate traffic qs signaling molecules through cell wall number bacterial species including agrobacterium citation citation
OWNX--: our model we explore hypothesis aai imported environment active pump also under transcriptional control trard
MISC--: indeed msh operon contains five open reading frames encode putative abc type importer whose function not completely understood but been hypothesized active transporter aai into cell citation
MISC--: taking into consideration this uncertainty putative aai importer model denoted simply imp
