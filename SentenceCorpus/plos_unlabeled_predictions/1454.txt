OWNX--: rates hospital acquired infections methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus increasingly used quality indicators hospital hygiene
MISC--: alternatively rates may vary between hospitals because hospitals differ admission referral potentially colonized patients
MISC--: we assessed if different referral patterns between hospitals health care networks influence rates hospital acquired infections like mrsa
OWNX--: we used dutch medical registration measure connectedness between hospitals
MISC--: this allowed us reconstruct network hospitals netherlands
OWNX--: we used mathematical models assess effect different patient referral patterns potential spread hospital acquired infections between hospitals between categories hospitals
MISC--: university hospitals higher number shared patients than teaching general hospitals therefore more likely among first receive colonized patients
MISC--: moreover network directional towards university hospitals they higher prevalence even when infection control measures equally effective all hospitals
MISC--: patient referral patterns profound effect spread health care associated infections like hospital acquired mrsa
MISC--: mrsa prevalence therefore differs between hospitals position each hospital within health care network
MISC--: any comparison mrsa rates between hospitals benchmark hospital hygiene should therefore take position hospital within network into account
MISC--: pathogens typically cause hospital acquired infections opportunistic nature
MISC--: organisms usually part normal bacterial flora humans only cause disease when reaching body sites normally free bacterial colonization e g when anatomical barriers breached due trauma medical surgical interventions
MISC--: this reason severe problems nosocomial pathogens mainly seen very young elderly most frequently institutions hospitals long term care facilities where patients treated acute chronic conditions
MISC--: methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus antimicrobial resistant variant s aureus common bacteria frequently colonizing healthy humans animals
MISC--: emergence mrsa due acquisition large dna fragment seems rare citation citation
MISC--: expansion limited number mrsa clones characterizes current epidemic hospitals worldwide therefore believed result between patient transmission only minor extent due de novo emergence patients exposed antibiotics
MISC--: mrsa therefore become marker success failure hospital infection control citation
MISC--: prevalence mrsa differs considerably within between countries citation citation
MISC--: currently about percent s aureus causing bloodstream infections uk resistant methicillin against only percent netherlands scandinavian countries citation
MISC--: although high endemic countries mrsa infections frequent all hospitals proportions highest large teaching hospitals citation citation also report highest frequency newly occurring mrsa clones citation citation
CONT--: severity underlying medical condition patients well higher antibiotic use frequency invasive procedures been proposed main reasons this difference citation
MISC--: patients carry mrsa asymptomatically long time citation
MISC--: when readmitted they may introduce pathogen acquired during previous admission into new hospital citation
MISC--: failure one hospital s infection control measures therefore affect prevalence hospitals shares patients citation
MISC--: patients referred hospitals at different rates depending function hospitals within health care system likely affect prevalence at different institutions
OWNX--: referral patterns might therefore offer explanation high mrsa incidence hospitals tertiary referral level citation
MISC--: but referral patterns account differences spread between hospitals differences observed prevalence
MISC--: answer questions we been mapping health care network based large national medical registry evaluated occurrence hospital acquired infections different care categories under simulated epidemic conditions
