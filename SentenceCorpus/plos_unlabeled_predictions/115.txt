MISC--: g protein coupled receptors encoded about percent human genes comprise largest family integral membrane proteins act cell surface receptors responsible transduction endogenous signal into cellular response
MISC--: although tertiary structural information crucial function annotation drug design there few experimentally determined gpcr structures
OWNX--: address this issue we employ recently developed threading assembly refinement method generate structure predictions all putative gpcrs human genome
CONT--: unlike traditional homology modeling approaches tasser modeling does not require solved homologous template structures moreover often refines structures closer native
MISC--: features essential comprehensive modeling all human gpcrs when close homologous templates absent
MISC--: based benchmarked confidence score approximately predicted models should correct folds
MISC--: majority gpcr models share characteristic seven transmembrane helix topology but orfs predicted different structures
MISC--: this due gpcr fragments predominantly extracellular intracellular domains well database annotation errors
CONT--: our preliminary validation includes automated modeling bovine rhodopsin only solved gpcr protein data bank
MISC--: homologous templates excluded final model built tasser global c root mean squared deviation native root mean squared deviation transmembrane helix region
MISC--: models several representative gpcrs compared mutagenesis affinity labeling data consistent agreement demonstrated
MISC--: structure clustering predicted models shows gpcrs similar structures tend belong similar functional class even when their sequences diverse

MISC--: while knowledge protein s structure furnishes important information understanding its function drug design citation progress solving gpcr structures been slow citation
MISC--: nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy x ray crystallography two major techniques used determine protein structures
MISC--: nmr spectroscopy advantages protein does not need crystallized dynamical information extracted
OWNX--: however high concentrations dissolved proteins needed yet no complete gpcr structure been solved method
MISC--: x ray crystallography provide very precise atomic information globular proteins but gpcrs extremely difficult crystallize

MISC--: among three types structure prediction algorithms homology modeling citation citation threading citation citation ab initio folding citation citation cm builds models aligning target sequence evolutionarily related template structure provides most accurate models
MISC--: however its success largely dictated evolutionary relationship between target template proteins
MISC--: example proteins greater than percent sequence identity their templates cm models tend quite close native structure root mean squared deviation native their backbone atoms comparable low resolution x ray nmr experiments citation citation
MISC--: when sequence identity drops below percent termed twilight zone cm model accuracy sharply decreases because lack significant structure match substantial alignment errors
MISC--: here models provided cm often closer template model based rather than native structure sequence interest
MISC--: this been significant unsolved problem citation
MISC--: among all registered human gpcrs there only four sequences sequence identity bovine rh greater than percent
MISC--: ninety nine percent human gpcrs average sequence identity bovine rh percent lie outside traditional comparative modeling regimen citation

MISC--: absence additional gpcr crystal structures computer based modeling may provide best alternative obtaining structural information citation citation
MISC--: this work we exploit tasser predict tertiary structures all gpcr sequences human genome less than amino acids length
AIMX--: only sequence given gpcr passed tasser no other extrinsic knowledge incorporated into our structure prediction approach
MISC--: because rearrangements tm helices rh may occur nonhomologous gpcrs ability refine templates most important advantage using tasser comprehensive gpcr modeling
MISC--: also distinct many other gpcr modeling methods only attempt model tm helical regions citation citation citation tasser generates reasonable predictions loop regions
MISC--: benchmark tests citation percent loops four more residues tasser models global rmsd less than native
MISC--: contrast using widely used homology modeling tool modeller citation citation percentage loops this accuracy percent citation
MISC--: if one considers only accuracy loop conformation itself then percent tasser generated loops local rmsd less than average rmsd loops up residues below
MISC--: this especially important gpcr modeling extracellular loops often critical determining ligand specificity citation citation
MISC--: therefore full length tasser models offer substantial advantages over traditional comparative modeling methods likely greater aid understanding ligand signaling interactions gpcrs
