MISC--: evolutionary dynamics hiv during chronic phase infection driven host immune response selective pressures exerted through drug treatment
MISC--: understand model evolution hiv quantitatively parameters governing genetic diversification strength selection need known
MISC--: while mutation rates measured single replication cycles relevant effective recombination rate depends probability coinfection cell more than one virus only inferred population data
MISC--: however most population genetic estimators recombination rates assume absence selection hence limited applicability hiv since positive purifying selection important hiv evolution
MISC--: yet little known about distribution selection differentials between individual viruses impact single polymorphisms viral fitness
MISC--: here we estimate rate recombination distribution selection coefficients time series sequence data tracking evolution hiv within single patients
OWNX--: examining temporal changes genetic composition population we estimate effective recombination recombinations per site generation
OWNX--: furthermore we provide evidence selection coefficients at least percent observed non synonymous polymorphisms exceed percent per generation
OWNX--: results provide basis more detailed understanding evolution hiv
MISC--: particularly interesting case evolution response drug treatment where recombination facilitate rapid acquisition multiple resistance mutations
MISC--: methods developed here more precise more detailed studies will possible soon data higher time resolution greater sample sizes available
MISC--: human immunodeficiency virus ranks among most rapidly evolving entities known citation enabling virus continually escape immune system
MISC--: after infection hiv patients typically enter asymptomatic period lasting several years during virus present at low medium levels typically at viral load formula formula copies per ml plasma
MISC--: nevertheless number virions produced removed estimated around formula per day generation time slightly less than two days citation
MISC--: due this rapid turnover high mutation rate formula per site generation sequence diversity hiv within single patient rise formula percent within few years divergence founder strain increases formula percent per year citation although this rate not constant citation
MISC--: genotypic diversity subject positive selection novel variants not recognized host immune system reduce sensitivity anti retroviral drugs citation citation well purifying selection functional constraints citation
MISC--: addition high substitution rates strong selection genomes different hiv particles within same host frequently exchange genetic information
MISC--: this form viral recombination works follows whenever cell coinfected two more viruses daughter virions contain two rna strands different viruses citation citation
MISC--: next round infection recombinant genomes generated template switching reverse transcriptase while producing cdna
MISC--: been shown recombination hiv contributes significantly genetic diversity within patient citation citation
MISC--: cases super infection several hiv subtypes recombination give rise novel forms become part global epidemic citation
MISC--: observation recombinant viruses after change anti retroviral drug therapy citation suggests recombination might play important role evolution drug resistance predicted theoretical models citation
MISC--: amount recombination speeds up evolution drug resistance depends parameters governing population dynamics citation many not known sufficient accuracy
MISC--: vitro estimates recombination rate shown reverse transcriptase switches templates about formula times while transcribing entire genome resulting recombination rate formula per site generation citation citation
MISC--: however bare template switching rate only secondary importance since recombination generate diversity only if virion contains two rna strands originate different viruses requires coinfection host cells citation
MISC--: effective vivo recombination rate therefore compound quantity template switching rate probability coinfection single host cell contribute
MISC--: this effective recombination rate been estimated coalescent based methods developed population genetics citation citation
MISC--: methods use single sample sequences obtained diverse population estimate recombination rate topological incongruencies phylogenetic tree sequence sample
MISC--: together estimate mutation rate this allows estimate recombination rate real time units
MISC--: shriner et al citation report estimate formula per site generation implying almost ubiquitous coinfection host cells
MISC--: here we present different method estimate recombination rates longitudinal sequence data been obtained patients at approximately month intervals citation citation
MISC--: comparing sequence samples successive time points we estimate recombination rates distance time dependence probability cross over between pairs polymorphic sites
OWNX--: we find effective rate recombination formula per site generation
OWNX--: furthermore we estimate strength selection nonsynonymous polymorphisms measuring rate at allele frequencies change
OWNX--: we find fraction about percent observed nonsynonymous polymorphisms selected stronger than formula percent per generation
