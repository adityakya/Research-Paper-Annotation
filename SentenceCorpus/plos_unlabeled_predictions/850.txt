MISC--: predicting protein function structure remains active area interest particularly structural genomics initiatives where substantial number structures initially solved little no functional characterisation
MISC--: although global structure comparison methods used transfer functional annotations relationship between fold function complex particularly functionally diverse superfamilies evolved through different secondary structure embellishments common structural core
MISC--: majority prediction algorithms employ local templates built known predicted functional residues
OWNX--: here we present novel method automatically generates structural motifs associated different functional sub families within functionally diverse domain superfamilies
OWNX--: templates created purely basis their specificity given fsg method makes no prior prediction functional sites nor assumes specific physico chemical properties residues
MISC--: flora able accurately discriminate between homologous domains different functions substantially outperforms popular structure comparison methods leading function prediction method
OWNX--: we benchmark flora large data set enzyme superfamilies all three major protein classes demonstrate functional relevance motifs identifies
MISC--: we also provide novel predictions enzymatic activity large number structures solved protein structure initiative
OWNX--: overall we show flora able effectively detect functionally similar protein domain structures purely using patterns structural conservation all residues
MISC--: prediction protein function structure become increasing interest significant proportion citation structures solved structural genomics initiatives lack functional annotation
MISC--: furthermore structure based approaches particular interest predicting binding sites catalytic sites purposes protein engineering pharmaceutical development
MISC--: many current methods focus encoding template functional residues then aligning this template whole structures
MISC--: problems taking this approach deciding what qualifies functional residue creating biologically accurate templates ever increasing number available protein structures being deposited pdb citation
MISC--: resources catalytic site atlas citation carefully curated hand restricted residues directly involved catalysis whereas msdsite citation pdbsite citation citation generate templates based active site residues defined pdb file authors
MISC--: although resources undoubtedly extremely valuable questionable whether sufficient coverage pdb maintained when manual intervention required
MISC--: address problem generating templates all protein structures there number methods aim do this automatically
MISC--: example reverse template method citation decomposes query structure into tri peptide fragments then matched against non redundant set pdb structures using search algorithm jess citation
MISC--: hits evaluated according sequence similarity local environment template
MISC--: gasp method citation uses genetic algorithm construct templates based their ability discriminate between different protein families against background representatives scop database citation
MISC--: similarly drespat citation implements graph theoretical approach discover structural patterns associated given family proteins locate ligand binding motifs
MISC--: multiprot citation provide template structures through multiple structure alignment
OWNX--: recent extension evolutionary trace method binding site prediction was used create structural templates based predicted functional residues citation
MISC--: siteengines citation produces templates matching geometry physico chemical properties residues binding site clefts
MISC--: well atom residue level templates other non template based approaches seek compare electrostatic properties binding sites surface accessible clefts often co locate active sites
MISC--: one inherent complexity using pdb structures transfer annotations between enzymes binding state protein crystallised example structures crystallised non cognate ligands substrate analogs transition states apo enzymes citation
MISC--: consequence precise geometric matching active site region problematic due conformational changes occur ligand binding
CONT--: address this issue methods mentioned above use variety approaches graph matching geometric hashing various tolerance levels
MISC--: soippa method citation citation takes alternative approach using geometric potential characterise shape formed given set c atoms account both local global relationships between residues across protein structure
MISC--: recent ligand binding site comparison analysis soippa was able detect distant similarities between very different protein folds binding range adenine containing ligands citation
MISC--: despite many template methods present literature very few publicly available general user
MISC--: hence first step assigning function structure often use global structure comparison methods detect distant evolutionary relationships even where sequence similarity weak
MISC--: methods been specifically applied function prediction assign confidence values when inheriting go terms between related structures
MISC--: however detecting very distant relatives remains challenge structure comparison methods generally give absolute measure structural distance rmsd applying cut off at one deduce two proteins perform related functions results many missed relationships
MISC--: analyses cath citation citation shown although function structure well conserved majority superfamilies there significant number highly diverse superfamilies where this not case citation
MISC--: moreover latter superfamilies disproportionately represented both pdb genomes tend exhibit wide range core biological functions across large range species citation
MISC--: analysis reeves et al citation showed relatives within superfamilies tend share common evolutionary core but this core embellished different insertions secondary structure elements often correlate changes function
MISC--: however although structural embellishments might change some facet function others found relatives still retain other aspects common citation citation
MISC--: therefore calculating global measure structural similarity distance between two proteins less informative than focussing structural motifs relevant given aspect function
MISC--: flora algorithm presented here was designed derive structural templates functional sub groups within diverse cath superfamilies
MISC--: flora first performs global structure alignment across superfamily recognise distinctive structural patterns associated each fsg builds templates based patterns
MISC--: new functional homologues then detected using global structural alignments relatives each fsg again but only scoring similarity over positions identified flora motif
CONT--: this approach performs very well discriminating between different enzymatic functions compared global methods another motif based approach
OWNX--: although we benchmark here enzyme superfamilies method applicable superfamilies containing non enzymatic relatives
OWNX--: test flora we automatically generated large data set domains diverse superfamilies
OWNX--: our data set allows us look at variation flora results between superfamilies stress importance using large test data set benchmarking methods
MISC--: we benchmarked flora against ce citation cathedral citation reverse templates citation give indication how performs comparison other standard methods function prediction
OWNX--: we also present some examples structural motifs identified flora explain their functional relevance
AIMX--: finally we use flora make novel predictions function proteins solved protein structure initiative
