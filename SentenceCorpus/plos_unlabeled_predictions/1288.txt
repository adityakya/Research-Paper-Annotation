MISC--: computational methods attempting identify instances cis regulatory modules genome face challenging problem searching potentially interacting transcription factor binding sites while knowledge specific interactions involved remains limited
MISC--: without comprehensive comparison their performance reliability accuracy tools remains unclear
OWNX--: faced large number different tools address this problem we summarized categorized them based search strategy input data requirements
MISC--: twelve representative methods were chosen applied predict crms drosophila crm database redfly across human encode regions
OWNX--: our results show optimal choice method varies depending species composition sequences question
MISC--: when discriminating crms non coding regions those methods considering evolutionary conservation stronger predictive power than methods designed run single genome
MISC--: different crm representations search strategies rely different crm properties different methods complement one another
MISC--: example some favour homotypical clusters binding sites while others perform best short crms
MISC--: furthermore most methods appear sensitive composition structure genome they applied
OWNX--: we analyze principal features distinguish methods performed well identify weaknesses leading poor performance provide guide users
OWNX--: we also propose key considerations development evaluation future crm prediction methods
MISC--: cis acting transcriptional regulation involves sequence specific binding transcription factors dna citation citation
MISC--: most cases multiple transcription factors control transcription single transcription start site cooperatively
MISC--: limited repertoire transcription factors performs this complex regulatory step through various spatial temporal interactions between themselves their binding sites
MISC--: genome wide scale transcription factor binding interactions clustered distinct modules rather than distributed evenly
MISC--: modules called cis regulatory modules
MISC--: dna sequences promoters enhancers silencers others examples modules
MISC--: appropriate transcription factors compete bind elements act activators repressors
MISC--: generally crm ranges few hundred basepairs long few thousand basepairs long several transcription factors bind each transcription factors multiple binding sites
MISC--: berman et al citation demonstrated feasibility identifying crms sequence analysis
MISC--: they scanned drosophila genome clusters potential binding sites five gap gene transcription factors known together regulate early drosophila embryo
MISC--: they found more than third dense clusters binding sites correspond crms regulating early embryo gene expressions characteristic genes regulated maternal gap transcription factors
MISC--: similarly exploiting property many crms contain clusters similar transcription factor binding sites schroeder et al citation computationally predicted crms over genomic regions genes interest gap mixed maternal gap transcription factors identified both known novel crms within segmentation gene network
CONT--: recent study confirmed importance crm functions revealed how subtle changes original arrangement module elements affect its function
MISC--: gompel et al citation found modifications cis regulatory elements pigmentation gene yellow cause wing pigmentation spot appear drosophila biarmipes similar seen drosophila melanogaster thus showing mutations crms generate novelty between species
MISC--: later study citation they showed creation destruction distinct regulatory elements same gene lead same morphological change
MISC--: williams et al citation investigated genetic switch whereby hox protein abd b controls bab expression sexually dimorphic trait drosophila
MISC--: they discovered functional difference this case lies not only creation destruction binding sites but also their orientations spacings
MISC--: there also evidence showing disruption cooperations within specific crm lead malformation disease
MISC--: one example given kleinjan et al citation
MISC--: deletion any distal regulatory elements pax changes its expression level causes congenital eye malformation aniridia brain defects human
