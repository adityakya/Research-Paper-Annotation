MISC--: centrality lethality rule notes high degree nodes protein interaction network tend correspond proteins essential suggests topological prominence protein protein interaction network may good predictor its biological importance
MISC--: even though correlation between degree essentiality was confirmed many independent studies reason this correlation remains illusive
MISC--: several hypotheses about putative connections between essentiality hubs topology protein protein interaction networks been proposed but we demonstrate explanations not supported properties protein interaction networks
MISC--: identify main topological determinant essentiality provide biological explanation connection between network topology essentiality we performed rigorous analysis six variants genomewide protein interaction network saccharomyces cerevisiae obtained using different techniques
OWNX--: we demonstrated majority hubs essential due their involvement essential complex biological modules group densely connected proteins shared biological function enriched essential proteins
MISC--: moreover we rejected two previously proposed explanations centrality lethality rule one relating essentiality hubs their role overall network connectivity another relying recently published essential protein interactions model
MISC--: intriguing question analysis biological networks whether biological characteristics protein essentiality explained its placement network i e whether topological prominence implies biological importance
MISC--: one first connections between two context protein interaction network so called centrality lethality rule was observed jeong colleagues citation who demonstrated high degree nodes hubs protein interaction network saccharomyces cerevisiae contain more essential proteins than would expected chance
MISC--: since then correlation between degree essentiality was confirmed other studies citation citation but until recently there was no systematic attempt examine reasons this correlation
OWNX--: particular what main topological determinant essentiality
MISC--: number immediate neighbors some other more global topological property essential proteins may protein interaction network
MISC--: jeong colleagues citation suggested overrepresentation essential proteins among high degree nodes attributed central role hubs play mediating interactions among numerous less connected proteins
MISC--: indeed removal hubs disrupts connectivity network measured network diameter size largest connected component more than removal equivalent number random nodes citation citation
MISC--: therefore under assumption organism s function depends connectivity among various parts its interactome hubs would predominantly essential because they play central role maintaining this connectivity
MISC--: recently he colleagues challenged hypothesis essentiality being function global network structure proposed majority proteins essential due their involvement one more essential protein protein interactions distributed uniformly at random along network edges citation
MISC--: under this hypothesis hubs proposed predominantly essential because they involved more interactions thus more likely involved one essential
OWNX--: this work we carefully evaluate each proposed explanations centrality lethality rule
MISC--: recently several hypotheses linked structural properties protein interaction networks biological phenomena come under scrutiny main concern being observed properties due experimental artifacts other biases present networks lack any biological implication
BASE--: limit impact biases results reported our study we use six variants genomewide protein interaction network saccharomyces cerevisiae compiled diverse sources interaction evidence citation citation
MISC--: assess whether essentiality hubs related their role maintaining network connectivity we performed two tests
OWNX--: first if this were case then we would expect essential hubs more important maintaining network connectivity than nonessential hubs
OWNX--: we found this not case
OWNX--: next addition node degree we consider several other measures topological prominence we demonstrate some them better predictors role node plays network connectivity than node degree
MISC--: thus if essentiality were related maintaining network connectivity then one would expect essentiality better correlated centrality measures than node degree
OWNX--: however we found node degree better predictor essentiality than any other measure tested
OWNX--: reject essential protein interaction model citation we used hypothesis testing approach
OWNX--: namely we observed this model implies probability protein essential independent probability another noninteracting protein essential
OWNX--: however tested networks essentiality noninteracting proteins share interaction partners correlated
OWNX--: thus we reject independence assumption result essential protein interaction model high confidence
OWNX--: motivated our findings we propose alternative explanation centrality lethality rule
OWNX--: our explanation draws growing realization phenotypic effect gene knockout experiments function group functionally related genes genes whose gene products members same multiprotein complex citation
MISC--: well known densely connected subnetworks enriched proteins share biological function
MISC--: therefore one would expect dense subnetworks protein interaction networks should either enriched depleted essential proteins
MISC--: indeed hart colleagues observed essential proteins not distributed evenly among set automatically indentified multiprotein complexes citation
AIMX--: this work we observe same phenomenon holds potentially larger groups densely connected functionally related proteins we call complex biological modules
AIMX--: we demonstrate due uneven distribution essential proteins among cobims majority essential proteins lie those cobims enriched essential proteins we call essential complex biological modules
MISC--: very definition ecobims contain relative their size more essential nodes than random group proteins same size
OWNX--: but what fraction all essential hubs members ecobims
OWNX--: how does this number relate what expected chance
OWNX--: fact how does enrichment hubs members nonmembers ecobims essential proteins relate enrichment values expected chance under suitable randomization protocol
OWNX--: we propose membership ecobims largely accounts enrichment hubs essential proteins
OWNX--: support this hypothesis we found fraction essential proteins among non ecobim hubs depending network only percent almost low network average
CONT--: furthermore essentiality nodes not members ecobims only weakly correlated their degree
MISC--: finally using randomization experiment we demonstrated properties characteristic protein interaction network unlikely corresponding randomized network
