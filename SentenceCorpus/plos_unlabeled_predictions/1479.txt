MISC--: exposure environmental chemicals drugs may negative effect human health
MISC--: better understanding molecular mechanism compounds needed determine risk
MISC--: we present high confidence human protein protein association network built upon integration chemical toxicology systems biology
MISC--: this computational systems chemical biology model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds diseases thus predicting compounds may risk factors human health
MISC--: additionally network used identify unexpected potential associations between chemicals proteins
MISC--: examples shown chemicals associated breast cancer lung cancer necrosis potential protein targets di ethylhexyl phthalate tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin pirinixic acid permethrine
OWNX--: chemical protein associations supported through recent published studies illustrate power our approach integrates toxicogenomics data other data types
MISC--: humans daily exposed diverse hazardous chemicals via skincare products plastic cups computers pesticides mention but few sources
MISC--: potential effect environmental compounds human health major concern citation citation
MISC--: example chemicals phthalate plasticizers been widely linked allergies reproductive disorders neurological defects
MISC--: humans intentionally exposed drugs used treatment cure diseases
MISC--: many drugs affect multiple targets may interact affect same proteins environmental chemicals citation citation
MISC--: mechanism action small molecules often not completely understood associated adverse toxic effects through example drug drug interactions citation
MISC--: there thus need improve our understanding underlying mechanism action chemicals biological pathways they perturb fully evaluate impact small molecules human health
OWNX--: essential step towards deciphering effect chemicals human health identify all possible molecular targets given chemical
MISC--: various network oriented chemical pharmacology approaches been published recently identify novel protein candidates drugs using structural chemical similarity citation citation
MISC--: example keiser et al citation applied network analysis drugs their targets
OWNX--: authors identified unexpected molecular targets muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m alpha adrenergic receptor neurokinin nk receptor methadone emetine loperamide respectively
MISC--: additionally recent studies demonstrated chemicals could classified based upon their effect mrna expression detected microarrays citation citation
MISC--: lamb et al showed genomic signatures could used recognize drugs common mechanism action allowing discovery unknown modes action
MISC--: despite explosion chemical biological networks chemical toxicity remains major issue human health
MISC--: analysis environmental chemicals similar gene expression profiles still lacking
MISC--: recent advances toxicogenomics information gene protein activity response small molecule exposures becomes more available
OWNX--: this provide necessary data develop computational systems biology models predict both high level associations more detailed associations
OWNX--: this paper we present method associate chemicals disease identify potential molecular targets based integration toxicogenomics data chemical structures protein protein interaction data disease information functional annotation
MISC--: core our procedure derived target hopping concept defined previously citation
OWNX--: but instead considering only binding activity we extended concept gene expression
MISC--: if two proteins affected two chemicals then both proteins deemed associating chemical space
MISC--: our approach not only statistical model but mimics true biological system constructing network associations between human proteins defined protein protein association network
OWNX--: we validated our network comparison two high confidence protein protein interaction networks assessing functional enrichment clusters network generated
MISC--: p pan revealed both known well many novel surprising connections between chemicals diseases proteins
OWNX--: we provide literature support some unexpected associations connection between diethylhexylphthalate gamma aminobutyric acid receptor beta target citation well between apocarotenal chemical found spinach necrosis
OWNX--: this illustrates usefulness approach integrates toxicogenomics data other diverse data types
