OWNX--: genes common functions often exhibit correlated expression levels used identify sets interacting genes microarray data
MISC--: microarrays typically measure expression across genomic space creating massive matrix co expression must mined extract only most relevant gene interactions
OWNX--: we describe graph theoretical approach extracting co expressed sets genes based computation cliques
OWNX--: unlike results traditional clustering algorithms cliques not disjoint allow genes assigned multiple sets interacting partners consistent biological reality
MISC--: graph created thresholding correlation matrix include only correlations most likely signify functional relationships
OWNX--: cliques computed graph correspond sets genes significant edges present between all members set representing potential members common interacting pathways
OWNX--: clique membership used infer function about poorly annotated genes based known functions better annotated genes they share clique membership
OWNX--: we illustrate our method applying microarray data collected spleens mice exposed low dose ionizing radiation
OWNX--: differential analysis used identify sets genes whose interactions impacted radiation exposure
OWNX--: correlation graph also queried independently clique extract edges impacted radiation
OWNX--: we present several examples multiple gene interactions altered radiation exposure thus represent potential molecular pathways mediate radiation response
OWNX--: guilt association assumption genes similar expression patterns participate common cellular functions drives growing body effort extract cellular pathways microarray data citation citation
OWNX--: general tenet genes encoding proteins participating common pathway will display correlated expression levels when analyzed at sufficient scale identities known functions genes used highlight existing assimilate new functional pathways
MISC--: number recent studies validate concept guilt association demonstrating genes co expressed across multiple conditions more likely represent common functions than would expected chance alone citation citation
MISC--: date computational methods extract patterns lag far behind general agreement about their utility
OWNX--: majority methods extract pathways co regulation microarray data begin measure similarity e g euclidean distance pearson s correlation coefficient describes degree expression levels between pairs genes correlated across multiple conditions citation
MISC--: matrix correlations across microarray typically representing pairwise similarity expression patterns thousands genes starting point organize genes into clusters
MISC--: clustering includes wide variety algorithms organizing multivariate data into groups approximately similar expression patterns wealth clustering approaches been proposed citation
MISC--: however there several important limitations vast majority clustering algorithms contrast reality biology
OWNX--: first they disjoint requiring gene assigned only one cluster
OWNX--: while this simplifies amount data evaluated places artificial limitation biology under study many genes play important roles multiple but distinct pathways
MISC--: other main problem most measures similarity used clustering algorithms do not permit recognition negative correlations also common equally meaningful
MISC--: alternative assigning genes clusters correlation matrix thresholded create graph comprised only edges whose weights exceed predefined value
MISC--: allocco colleagues originally described graphs relevance networks citation
MISC--: relevance network both positive negative correlations exceeding specified threshold retained displayed graphically allowing visual recognition highly connected subsets genes
MISC--: recent studies mined relevance networks extract co expressed genes cancer cells citation citation myopathic muscle biopsies citation
CONT--: while those efforts provided gene subsets biological relevance respective conditions they were limited pairwise relationships could extracted manually graphs
MISC--: relevance networks contain many dense sub graphs tightly interconnected gene sets intuitively represent greatest potential identifying members common pathways
MISC--: without systematic means extract aggregate relationships between multiple genes however many most interesting relationships remain embedded within web correlations
OWNX--: we developed computational approach exploits graph theoretical algorithms identify comprehensively tightly connected subsets genes present relevance networks
OWNX--: most extreme case sub graph contains all possible edges between vertices sub graph this structure called clique
MISC--: terms gene expression clique represents most trusted potential identifying set interacting genes
