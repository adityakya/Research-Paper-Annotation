MISC--: representing analyzing complex networks remains roadblock creating dynamic network models biological processes pathways
MISC--: study cell fate transitions reveal much about transcriptional regulatory programs underlie phenotypic changes give rise coordinated patterns expression changes we observe
OWNX--: application gene expression state space trajectories capture cell fate transitions at genome wide level one approach currently used literature
AIMX--: this paper we analyze gene expression dataset huang et al follows differentiation promyelocytes into neutrophil like cells presence inducers dimethyl sulfoxide all trans retinoic acid
MISC--: huang et al build work kauffman who raised attractor hypothesis stating cells exist expression landscape their expression trajectories converge towards attractive sites this landscape
OWNX--: we propose alternative interpretation explains this convergent behavior recognizing there two types processes participating cell fate transitions core processes include specific differentiation pathways promyelocytes neutrophils transient processes capture those pathways responses specific inducer
BASE--: using functional enrichment analyses specific biological examples analysis trajectories their core transient components we provide validation our hypothesis using huang et al dataset
OWNX--: our understanding molecular basis wide range biological processes including development differentiation disease evolved significantly recent years
OWNX--: increasingly we coming recognize not single genes but rather complex networks genes gene products other cellular elements drive cellular metabolism cell fate when perturbed lead development disease phenotypes
MISC--: representing analyzing complex networks encompassing thousands tens thousands elements presents significant challenges
MISC--: one approach begun applied representation transcriptional changes transitions occur state space defined expression states all genes within cell citation citation
CONT--: this approach number advantages including providing framework predictive modeling incorporation stochastic components biological process
MISC--: underlying assumption analysis each cellular phenotype invariably traced back particular class genome wide gene expression signatures representing specific region gene expression state space
OWNX--: described huang et al citation this signature particular cellular state at particular instant time represented multidimensional gene expression vector high dimensional space where each coordinate represents expression level particular gene
OWNX--: considering all possible configurations this signature take we create multidimensional landscape referred expression state space citation
OWNX--: each observed phenotype represented single point state space
MISC--: when cells transition through successive phenotypes example during different stages hematopoietic differentiation specific sets genes alter their expression levels dictated underlying transcriptional program changes represented continuous trajectory expression state space ultimately represent transcriptional program being played out cell s collection gene networks complex pathways
OWNX--: kauffman citation first proposed idea stable cell fates cellular phenotypes we observe correspond attractors expression state space stable points system would return if subjected small perturbation
OWNX--: he points out principle cells could adopt any permutation gene expression states however this not what we observe nature
MISC--: according kauffman since there about different cell types there must approximately number attractors state space either valleys peaks landscape represent stable cell fates cell types cells will ultimately converge presence inducer perturbation
CONT--: while this interesting model direct experimental evidence supporting its overall utility explaining cellular mechanism remain seen
MISC--: huang et al citation reported evidence they claim demonstrated existence attractor
MISC--: they conducted gene expression time course experiment differentiation human hl promyelocytic cells into neutrophils using two different inducers dimethyl sulfoxide all trans retinoic acid
OWNX--: time course data was collected using affymetrix u av genechips analyzed provide gene expression level measures necessary create state space model
MISC--: using principal components analysis they develop two dimensional state space representation dmso atra induce initially divergent trajectories over time converge common trajectory leading final expression state representing neutrophils
MISC--: they argue instead observing trajectories explore state space trajectories display convergence single point this therefore provides empirical proof attractive states exist nature
OWNX--: here we propose alternative interpretation this convergent behavior does not appeal attractor hypothesis but rather explores this observation context superposition components reflect pathways activated applied perturbations
BASE--: this end we extend work huang et al citation decomposing state space trajectories into components comprising two sets genes core group transient group capture stimulus independent stimulus dependent effects respectively
MISC--: superposition components reflect observation both sources effects independently influence overall shape trajectory taken during cell fate transition
OWNX--: we show how this division allows us look at functional behavior genes their contribution cell fate transitions more enlightening way
AIMX--: using regression models we isolate core genes common both stimuli represent those critical differentiation process
MISC--: genes outside core represent transient component trajectory corresponding perturbation effects
OWNX--: illustrate our ideas we apply our method same published dataset generated huang et al citation
OWNX--: hl cell line long been used model understand molecular mechanisms driving progression pathogenesis acute promyelocytic leukemia citation
MISC--: normal promyelocytes proliferation differentiation tightly coupled processes
MISC--: however this balance comes unstuck apl cells result cells proliferate disregulated fashion
MISC--: discovery inducers like ra dmso could reprogram apl cells overcome this block resume differentiation led emergence class therapeutics known differentiation therapy citation
MISC--: dmso organic solvent but also functions cryoprotective agent tissue cell culture citation
OWNX--: although widely used veterinary medicine treatment pain inflammation not generally used humans because known hepatotoxic
MISC--: hormone atra derivative vitamin belongs class molecules called retinoids citation
MISC--: atra currently used differentiation therapies treat human patients apl
MISC--: current complete remission rates apl patients atra based differentiation therapy combination chemotherapy been reported high percent citation
OWNX--: at molecular level both dmso atra arrest cell cycle at g s phase transition point induce terminal differentiation hl cells resulting neutrophil like cells
MISC--: atra dmso biochemically distinct molecules activate slightly different sets pathways hl cells
MISC--: huang et al citation explain this reason why trajectories initially diverge explore different parts expression state space
MISC--: they argue presence attractor then causes trajectories converge different directions eventually arrive at common endpoint discount possibility specific unique differentiation pathway may triggered both inducers
OWNX--: while this argument may seem conceptually appealing upon further inspection attractor hypothesis greatly limits our ability develop mechanistic interpretations build predictive models cell fate transitions
MISC--: we believe there exists alternative more plausible interpretation huang et al citation kauffman citation not considered
MISC--: our interpretation based recognition there two types processes contribute cell fate transitions one core biological process inherent transition specific event two transient process related direct effects particular inducing agent exerts cell
MISC--: early divergence seen state space trajectories described huang et al citation reflective cells response specific perturbation compound specific response follows
OWNX--: we expect transient processes dominate only at initial period time course since most drugs metabolized quickly cell
MISC--: once this disorder subsided targeted effects each inducer expected begun triggering core processes this occurs directions both trajectories adopt become more more convergent because overlap activated pathways dmso induced cells atra induced cells growing larger cells transition towards their common endpoint
MISC--: source this convergence therefore not necessarily due existence attractor but instead explained combination two types processes exerting their temporal effects cells
MISC--: indeed if attractor existed then there should whole class perturbations would cause transitions initial final state rather than small number activate single core pathway
MISC--: if one adopts attractor hypothesis basis cell fate transitions then our interpretation much closer conrad waddington he argued canalization state space through existence defined paths canals between attractor states citation citation
