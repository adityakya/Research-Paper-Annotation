MISC--: computational methods discovery sequence elements enriched target set compared background set fundamental molecular biology research
MISC--: one example discovery transcription factor binding motifs inferred chip chip measurements
MISC--: several major challenges sequence motif discovery still require consideration need principled approach partitioning data into target background sets lack rigorous models exact p value measuring motif enrichment need appropriate framework accounting motif multiplicity tendency many existing methods report presumably significant motifs even when applied randomly generated data
AIMX--: this paper we present statistical framework discovering enriched sequence elements ranked lists resolves four issues
OWNX--: we demonstrate implementation this framework software application termed drim identifies sequence motifs lists ranked dna sequences
OWNX--: we applied drim chip chip cpg methylation data obtained following results
MISC--: identification novel putative transcription factor binding sites yeast chip chip data
MISC--: biological function some them was further investigated gain new insights transcription regulation networks yeast
MISC--: example our discoveries enable elucidation network tf aro
MISC--: another finding concerns systematic tf binding enhancement sequences containing ca repeats
MISC--: discovery novel motifs human cancer cpg methylation data
MISC--: remarkably most motifs similar dna sequence elements bound polycomb complex promotes histone methylation
OWNX--: our findings thus support model histone methylation cpg methylation mechanistically linked
AIMX--: overall we demonstrate statistical framework embodied drim software tool highly effective identifying regulatory sequence elements variety applications ranging expression chip chip cpg methylation data
OWNX--: drim publicly available at link
AIMX--: this paper examines problem discovering interesting sequence motifs biological sequence data
OWNX--: widely accepted more formal definition this task given target set background set sequences identify sequence motifs enriched target set compared background set
AIMX--: purpose this paper extend this formulation make more flexible so enable determination target background set data driven manner
OWNX--: discovery sequences attributes enriched target set compared background set become increasingly useful wide range applications molecular biology research
MISC--: example discovery dna sequence motifs overabundant set promoter regions co expressed genes suggest explanation this co expression
MISC--: another example discovery dna sequences enriched set promoter regions certain transcription factor binds strongly inferred chromatin immuno precipitation microarray citation measurements
MISC--: same principle may extended many other applications discovery genomic elements enriched set highly methylated cpg island sequences citation
MISC--: due its importance this task discovering enriched dna subsequences capturing their corresponding motif profile gained much attention literature
CONT--: any approach motif discovery must address several fundamental issues
OWNX--: first issue way motifs represented
MISC--: there several strategies motif representation using k mer iupac symbols where each symbol represents fixed set possible nucleotides at single position using position weight matrix specifies probability observing each nucleotide at each motif position
MISC--: both representations assume base position independence
MISC--: alternatively higher order representations capture positional dependencies been proposed
MISC--: while representations circumvent position independence assumption they more vulnerable overfitting lack data determining model parameters
OWNX--: method described this paper uses k mer model symbols above iupac
MISC--: second issue devising motif scoring scheme
MISC--: many strategies scoring motifs been suggested literature
CONT--: one simple yet powerful approach uses hypergeometric distribution identifying enriched motif kernels set sequences then expanding motifs using em algorithm citation
AIMX--: framework described this paper natural extension approach citation
MISC--: ymf citation citation exhaustive search algorithm associates each motif z score
MISC--: alignace citation uses gibbs sampling algorithm finding global sequence alignments produces map score
OWNX--: this score internal metric used determine significance alignment
MISC--: meme citation uses expectation maximization strategy outputs log likelihood relative entropy associated each motif
MISC--: once scoring scheme devised defined motif search space scanned motifs significantly high scores identified
MISC--: determine statistical significance obtained scores many methods resort simulations ad hoc thresholds
MISC--: several excellent reviews narrate different strategies motif detection use quantitative benchmarking compare their performance citation citation
AIMX--: related aspect motif discovery outside scope this paper focuses properties clusters modules tf binding sites
MISC--: examples approaches search combinatorial patterns modules underlying tf binding gene expression include citation citation
