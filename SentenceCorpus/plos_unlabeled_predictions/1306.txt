MISC--: synchronization hz oscillatory activity principle neurons olfactory bulb believed important odor discrimination
MISC--: previous theoretical studies fast rhythms other brain areas proposed principle neuron synchrony mediated short latency rapidly decaying inhibition
OWNX--: this phasic inhibition provides narrow time window principle neurons fire thus promoting synchrony
OWNX--: however olfactory bulb inhibitory granule cells produce long lasting small amplitude asynchronous aperiodic inhibitory input thus narrow time window required synchronize spiking does not exist
OWNX--: instead been suggested correlated output granule cells could serve synchronize uncoupled mitral cells through mechanism called stochastic synchronization wherein synchronization arises through correlation inputs two neural oscillators
MISC--: almost all work synchrony due correlations presumes correlation imposed fixed
