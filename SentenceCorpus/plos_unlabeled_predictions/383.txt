MISC--: drug molecules not only interact specific targets but also alter state function associated biological network
OWNX--: how design drugs evaluate their functions at systems level becomes key issue highly efficient low side effect drug design
MISC--: arachidonic acid metabolic network network produces inflammatory mediators several enzymes including cyclooxygenase been used targets anti inflammatory drugs
MISC--: however neither century old nonsteriodal anti inflammatory drugs nor recently revocatory vioxx provided completely successful anti inflammatory treatment
MISC--: gain more insights into anti inflammatory drug design authors studied dynamic properties arachidonic acid metabolic network human polymorphous leukocytes
MISC--: metabolic flux exogenous aa effects drug efficacy been analyzed using ordinary differential equations
MISC--: flux balance aa network was found important efficient safe drug design
MISC--: when only lipoxygenase inhibitor was used flux cox pathway was increased significantly showing single functional inhibitor cannot effectively control production inflammatory mediators
MISC--: when both cox lox were blocked production inflammatory mediators could completely shut off
MISC--: authors also investigated differences between dual functional cox lox inhibitor mixture two types inhibitors
MISC--: their work provides example integration systems biology drug discovery
OWNX--: nonsteriodal anti inflammatory drugs widely used treatment musculoskeletal pain other conditions
MISC--: us more than percent population uses nsaids daily citation market nsaids now amounts more than billion annually worldwide citation
MISC--: although nsaids do alleviate aches pains drugs undesirable side effects gastrointestinal tract central nervous system addition potential exacerbation conditions asthma citation
MISC--: findings cyclooxygenase plays major role inflammation inhibition cox causes gastrointestinal toxicity mild bleeding diathesis citation had suggested selective cox inhibitor would effective anti inflammatory drug low gastrointestinal side effects citation
MISC--: ironically unexpected cardiovascular side effects selective cox inhibitors surfaced citation citation
MISC--: thus september merck company announced voluntary withdrawal company s cox inhibitor vioxx citation
MISC--: other fda approved cox inhibitors celecoxib valdecoxib being re evaluated citation citation
MISC--: despite years studies safe anti inflammatory drug design remains great challenge
MISC--: failures anti inflammatory drug design illustrate limitations current drug discovery paradigm
OWNX--: steady waning productivity pharmaceutical industry past decade been observed
MISC--: this decline coincides introduction target based drug discovery citation
MISC--: recently medicinal chemists started think about drug discovery systems biology perspective citation citation
MISC--: studying cross talks between biological responses rather than one one may provide better understanding disease development achieve accurate evaluation drug efficacy toxicity citation citation
MISC--: this new approach been applied safe drug design citation citation
MISC--: example former smithkline beecham focused blood coagulation cascade biochemical network citation citation
MISC--: armed good understanding disease regulatory network level company used model predictions develop fully humanized anti factor ix antibody entered clinical trials
MISC--: rajasethupathy et al recently reviewed advances practical applications systems biology drug discovery citation
MISC--: researchers promote development network based drug design devises drug treatment strategies level disease system using computational models high throughput experiments
AIMX--: this paper we study dynamic properties arachidonic acid metabolic network human polymorphonuclear leukocytes hope gaining more insights into anti inflammatory drug design
MISC--: ordinary differential equation model aa metabolic network was developed
AIMX--: flux analysis simulation addition exogenous aa were performed study network balance
OWNX--: therapeutic effects anti inflammatory inhibitors were simulated difference between dual functional cox lipoxygenase inhibitors mixture two types inhibitors was studied
OWNX--: corresponding experiments introduction exogenous aa cox lox inhibitors were performed were found consistent model predictions
BASE--: our work shows flux balance important efficacy safety drugs
OWNX--: compared traditional single target drugs drugs against multiple targets control network balance lead safer treatment
