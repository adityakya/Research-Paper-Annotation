MISC--: tracing potentially infectious contacts become important part control strategy many infectious diseases early cases novel infections endemic sexually transmitted infections
AIMX--: here we make use mathematical models consider case partner notification sexually transmitted infection however models sufficiently simple allow more general conclusions drawn
MISC--: we show when contact network structure considered addition contact tracing standard mass action models generally inadequate
OWNX--: consider impact mutual contacts we develop improvement existing pairwise network models we use demonstrate ceteris paribus clustering improves efficacy contact tracing large region parameter space
MISC--: this result sometimes reversed however case highly effective contact tracing
MISC--: we also develop stochastic simulations comparison using simple re wiring methods allow generation appropriate comparator networks
OWNX--: this way we contribute general theory network based interventions against infectious disease
MISC--: modelling become central tool understanding epidemiology infectious disease designing control strategies
MISC--: one control method contact tracing been considered large number disease contexts
MISC--: include sars pandemic citation citation uk fmd epidemic citation citation contingency planning deliberate release smallpox citation citation control sexually transmitted infections citation citation
OWNX--: particular benefit tracing allows targeting control at cost effort spent finding individuals at risk
MISC--: since contact tracing takes place process over network interactions between hosts natural consider network based models this process
MISC--: theoretical work so far dealt contact tracing branching process citation through modifications mean field equations citation pairwise approximations citation simulation citation
MISC--: this work means implications heterogeneous numbers contacts efficacy contact tracing reasonably well understood
MISC--: case clustering due analytical challenge posed existence short closed loops contact network generally been more difficult make similar progress
MISC--: existing theoretical work therefore either been restricted limiting case clump structured populations all clustering due completely connected cliques citation else simulation exemplar networks citation citation citation
AIMX--: this work we derive improved triple closure clustered pairwise models removes two significant problems existing closure regimes use this make systematic investigation impact clustering efficacy contact tracing keeping other network epidemiological parameters constant appropriate
MISC--: we find many parameter choices there intuitive explanations borne out modelling increased impact contact tracing clustering increases
OWNX--: this not however completely general result meaning full implications clustering efficacy contact tracing subtle should subject case case investigation
OWNX--: we perform our analysis within sis paradigm meaning while some our terminology will general all infectious disease epidemiology other statements will geared towards modelling sexually transmitted infections where recovery treatment does not confer lasting immunity
