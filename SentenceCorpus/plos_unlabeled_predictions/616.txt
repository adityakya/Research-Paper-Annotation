MISC--: progress understanding brain mechanisms underlying vision requires construction computational models not only emulate brain s anatomy physiology but ultimately match its performance visual tasks
OWNX--: recent years natural images become popular study vision been used show apparently impressive progress building models
OWNX--: here we challenge use uncontrolled natural images guiding progress
OWNX--: particular we show simple v like model neuroscientist s null model should perform poorly at real world visual object recognition tasks outperforms state art object recognition systems standard ostensibly natural image recognition test
OWNX--: counterpoint we designed simpler recognition test better span real world variation object pose position scale we show this test correctly exposes inadequacy v like model
OWNX--: taken together results demonstrate tests based uncontrolled natural images seriously misleading potentially guiding progress wrong direction
OWNX--: instead we reexamine what means images natural argue renewed focus core problem object recognition real world image variation
MISC--: visual object recognition extremely difficult computational problem
OWNX--: core problem each object world cast infinite number different d images onto retina object s position pose lighting background vary relative viewer
MISC--: yet brain solves this problem effortlessly
OWNX--: progress understanding brain s solution object recognition requires construction artificial recognition systems ultimately aim emulate our own visual abilities often biological inspiration
MISC--: computational approaches critically important because they provide experimentally testable hypotheses because instantiation working recognition system represents particularly effective measure success understanding object recognition
MISC--: however major challenge assessing recognition performance models
OWNX--: ideally artificial systems should able do what our own visual systems but unclear how evaluate progress toward this goal
MISC--: practice this amounts choosing image set against test performance
BASE--: although controversial popular recent approach study vision use natural images citation citation citation part because they ostensibly capture essence problems encountered real world
MISC--: example computational vision caltech image set emerged gold standard testing natural object recognition performance citation
MISC--: set consists large number images divided into object categories plus additional background category
CONT--: while number specific concerns been raised this set its images still currently widely used neuroscientists both theoretical experimental contexts
MISC--: logic caltech sheer number categories diversity those images place high bar object recognition systems require them solve computational crux object recognition
MISC--: because there object categories chance performance less than percent correct
MISC--: recent years several object recognition models shown what appears impressively high performance this test better than percent correct citation citation citation suggesting approaches while still well below human performance at least heading right direction
OWNX--: however we argue here caution not clear what extent natural image tests actually engage core problem object recognition
MISC--: specifically while caltech set certainly contains large number images variations object view position size etc between within object category poorly defined not varied systematically
MISC--: furthermore image backgrounds strongly covary object category
OWNX--: majority images also composed photographs human decided how shot should framed thus placement objects within image not random set may not properly reflect variation found real world
OWNX--: furthermore if caltech object recognition task hard not easy know what makes hard different kinds variation all inextricably mixed together
MISC--: problems not unique caltech set but also apply other uncontrolled natural image sets
