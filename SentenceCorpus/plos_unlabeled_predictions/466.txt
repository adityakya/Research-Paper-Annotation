MISC--: network analysis transcends conventional pairwise approaches data analysis context components network graph taken into account
OWNX--: approaches increasingly being applied genomics data where functional linkages used connect genes proteins
CONT--: however while microarray gene expression datasets now abundant high quality few approaches been developed analysis data network context
AIMX--: we present novel approach d visualisation analysis transcriptional networks generated microarray data
MISC--: networks consist nodes representing transcripts connected virtue their expression profile similarity across multiple conditions
OWNX--: analysing genome wide gene transcription across mouse tissues we describe unusual topography large highly structured networks produced demonstrate how they used visualise cluster mine large datasets
CONT--: this approach fast intuitive versatile allows identification biological relationships may missed conventional analysis techniques
MISC--: this work been implemented freely available open source application named biolayout express d
MISC--: complete genome sequencing hundreds pathogenic model organisms provided parts list required large scale studies gene function citation
MISC--: enormous amounts data pertaining nature genes proteins their interactions cell now been generated techniques including but not limited gene coexpression analysis yeast two hybrid assays mass spectrometry rna interference citation
MISC--: functional genomics proteomics approaches when combined computational biology emerging discipline systems biology finally allow us begin comprehensive mapping cellular molecular networks pathways citation citation
OWNX--: one main difficulties we currently face how best integrate disparate data sources use them better understand biological systems health disease citation
MISC--: visualisation analysis biological data networks becoming increasingly important approach explore wide variety biological relationships
MISC--: approaches already been used successfully study sequence similarity protein structure protein interactions evolution citation citation
MISC--: shifting biological data into graph network paradigm allows one use algorithms techniques ideas statistics previously developed graph theory engineering computer science computational systems biology
MISC--: classical graph theory graph network consists nodes connected edges
MISC--: biological networks nodes usually genes transcripts proteins while edges tend represent experimentally determined similarities functional linkages between them citation
MISC--: conventional analysis techniques generally pairwise where individual relationship between two biological entities studied without considering higher order interactions their neighbours
MISC--: graph network analysis techniques allow exploration position biological entity context its local neighbourhood graph network whole citation
MISC--: another important advantage techniques noisy datasets spurious edges tend not form structure resultant graph but instead randomly link nodes although this may not case data generated techniques inherent technical biases
MISC--: because many network analysis techniques exploit local structure networks between biologically related nodes they far less troubled inherent noise may confound conventional pairwise approaches citation
MISC--: one example network analysis clustering protein protein similarity interaction networks
MISC--: techniques illustrate graph clustering performs extremely well allows discovery novel aspects biological function citation
MISC--: techniques hence provide insight into both local features networks also global features network
MISC--: although network analysis biological data shown great promise little attention been paid microarray gene expression data
OWNX--: data now abundant generally high quality consist type high dimensional data approaches well suited
MISC--: principle transformation gene expression data into network graph holds few challenges
MISC--: similarity between individual expression profiles may determined one number possible statistical techniques e g pearson spearman correlation coefficients citation
MISC--: networks constructed connecting transcripts edges infer varying degrees coexpression based arbitrary correlation threshold citation
MISC--: indeed number groups previously sought apply network paradigm microarray data establishing relationships between genes based correlation expression citation citation
CONT--: while studies suggested power this approach limitations functionality visualisation capabilities tools supporting their attempts severely limited their approaches general application
AIMX--: this manuscript we describe development application new network analysis tool biolayout express d facilitates construction visualisation clustering analysis microarray gene expression data
OWNX--: specifically we chose analyse genomics institute novartis research foundation mouse tissue gene expression atlas demonstrate efficacy this approach citation
OWNX--: gnf data was generated so provide genome wide analysis transcript abundance across wide range normal tissue cell types
MISC--: this dataset represents one most complete systematic studies tissue specific expression mammalian transcriptome date
MISC--: however common other large datasets analysis data presents significant challenges
MISC--: certain genes known only expressed single cell type at specific times during development response explicit stimuli
OWNX--: others thought expressed all cells simultaneously at about same level
MISC--: between two extremes there many other genes expressed most number cell types but whose transcription may regulated give specific temporal spatial pattern expression
MISC--: also known genes play distinct roles common pathway biological process often expressed similar manner i e they coexpressed citation
OWNX--: hence when genes found analogous expression profiles this may indicate genes linked functional activities
AIMX--: better understand aspects gene regulation functional role encoded proteins we chose explore utility network analysis explore innate structure this dataset
OWNX--: we demonstrate this approach accurately locate clusters genes sharing similar network connectivity relationships between clusters statistical analysis functional annotations
