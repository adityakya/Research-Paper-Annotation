OWNX--: circulation important delivery method both natural synthetic molecules but microenvironment interactions regulated endothelial cells critical molecule s fate difficult interpret using traditional approaches
AIMX--: this work we analyzed predicted growth factor capture under flow using computer modeling three dimensional experimental approach includes pertinent circulation characteristics pulsatile flow competing binding interactions limited bioavailability
OWNX--: understanding controlling features this process was desired
MISC--: experimental module consisted bioreactor synthetic endothelial lined hollow fibers under flow
MISC--: physical design system was incorporated into model parameters
OWNX--: heparin binding growth factor fibroblast growth factor was used both experiments simulations
AIMX--: our computational model was composed three parts media flow equations mass transport equations cell surface reaction equations
MISC--: model based flow reactions within single hollow fiber was scaled linearly total number fibers comparison experimental results
OWNX--: our model predicted experiments confirmed removal heparan sulfate system would result dramatic loss binding heparin binding proteins but not proteins do not bind heparin
OWNX--: model further predicted significant loss bound protein at flow rates only slightly higher than average capillary flow rates corroborated experimentally suggesting probability capture single pass at high flow rates extremely low
MISC--: several other key parameters were investigated coupling between receptors proteoglycans shown critical impact successful capture
MISC--: combined system offers opportunities examine circulation capture straightforward quantitative manner should prove advantageous biologicals drug delivery investigations
MISC--: bioavailability molecules they circulate through bloodstream crucial factor their signaling capability
MISC--: half life circulation determine effectiveness drug simply regulating opportunities molecule interact vessel wall
MISC--: although vivo measurements routinely made researchers monitor serum levels molecules determine half lives interactions microenvironment not easily measured observed
MISC--: while some molecules may long circulation life many may only single opportunity interact blood vessel walls before being filtered through liver kidneys
MISC--: addition even molecules long circulation life may still face impediments direct interaction endothelium
MISC--: this example case vascular endothelial growth factor when bound bevacizumab monoclonal antibody vegf citation citation
MISC--: bevacizumab been shown increase circulating concentration vegf cancer patients when compared patients not undergoing therapy because increased half life growth factor antibody complex however complex unable bind vegf receptors citation making delivery vegf questionable
OWNX--: order better understand vessel microenvironment accurately monitor drug interactions context microenvironment better tools needed provide meaningful measurements predict fate molecules circulation
MISC--: many important measurements continue made using vitro mammalian tissue culture methods but there obvious limitations traditional two dimensional culture approach
OWNX--: circulation influence flow whether molecule remains fluid phase binds vessel wall dominant factor
MISC--: this influence cannot ascertained static tissue culture studies
MISC--: example velocity blood aorta mm sec while at capillary level less than mm sec citation
MISC--: this reduction velocity allows exchange processes at capillary level take place more efficiently citation likely also affects activity molecules circulation rely cell surface binding order fulfill their roles
CONT--: while direct measurement this binding process difficult our model makes use commercial bioreactor endothelial lined hollow tubes operating under pulsatile flow mimic vascular environment architecture directly measure loss molecules they pass through hollow fibers
OWNX--: we used single pass method allow better assessment effect flow either retaining molecules circulation permitting their interaction vessels
OWNX--: our approach also makes use bolus administration since this typical way drugs would delivered clinical setting
