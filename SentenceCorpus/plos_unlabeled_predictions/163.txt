MISC--: we developed software program weights integrates specific properties genes pathogen so they may ranked drug targets
AIMX--: we applied this software produce three prioritized drug target lists mycobacterium tuberculosis causative agent tuberculosis disease new drug desperately needed
MISC--: each list based individual criterion
MISC--: first list prioritizes metabolic drug targets uniqueness their roles m tuberculosis metabolome their similarity known druggable protein classes
MISC--: second list prioritizes targets would specifically impair m tuberculosis weighting heavily those closely conserved within actinobacteria class but lack close homology host gut flora
MISC--: m tuberculosis survive asymptomatically its host many years adapting dormant state referred persistence
MISC--: final list aims prioritize potential targets involved maintaining persistence m tuberculosis
MISC--: rankings current candidate proposed drug targets highlighted respect lists
MISC--: some features were found more accurate than others prioritizing studied targets
MISC--: also shown targets prioritized using evolutionary programming optimize weights each desired property
OWNX--: we demonstrate this approach prioritizing persistence targets
MISC--: cost research development pharmaceutical industry been rising steeply steadily last decade but amount time required bring new product market remains around ten fifteen years citation
MISC--: this problem been labeled innovation gap necessitates investment inexpensive technologies shorten length time spent drug discovery
BASE--: target identification stage first step drug discovery process citation provide foundation years dedicated research pharmaceutical industry
OWNX--: all other steps drug discovery this stage complicated fact identified drug target must satisfy variety criteria permit progression next stage
MISC--: important factors this context include homology between target host activity target diseased state citation citation essentiality target pathogen s growth survival citation citation
MISC--: values some selection criteria found easily querying publicly available bioinformatics resources including metabolic pathway databases kegg citation protein classification sets cogs citation databases druggable proteins citation citation citation
OWNX--: traditional prioritization approaches literature searches mental integration multiple criteria quickly become overwhelming researcher
MISC--: more effective alternative computational integration over different criteria create ranking function
OWNX--: this article we describe application assessdrugtarget ranks genes genome according given set weighted criteria
