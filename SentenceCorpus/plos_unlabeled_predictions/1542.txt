OWNX--: when movement outcome differs consistently intended movement errors used correct subsequent movements updating internal model motor sensory systems
AIMX--: here we examine changes internal model motor system under changes variance structure movement errors lacking overall bias
MISC--: we introduced horizontal visuomotor perturbation change statistical distribution movement errors anisotropically while monetary gains losses were awarded based movement outcomes
OWNX--: we derive predictions simulated movement planners each differing its internal model motor system
OWNX--: we find humans optimally respond overall change error magnitude but ignore anisotropy error distribution
OWNX--: through comparison simulated movement planners we found aimpoints corresponded quantitatively ideal movement planner updates strictly isotropic internal model error distribution
MISC--: aimpoints were planned manner ignored direction dependence error magnitudes despite continuous availability unambiguous information regarding anisotropic distribution actual motor errors
MISC--: motor system exquisitely sensitive perturbation
MISC--: ability sense discrepancy between planned executed movement respond accordingly one hallmarks motor learning citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: here we concerned nature error signal used update future movement plans when result movement does not match intended outcome
MISC--: course there infinite number statistics error signal cns might use update future motor plans ranging running average recent errors n th order moments distribution past errors
OWNX--: we interested exploring limits what statistics modeled nervous system
MISC--: previous work focused neuromotor corrections imposed bias where corrective responses found opposite direction previous errors proportional prior error extents citation citation citation
MISC--: this work supports motor learning models future motor plans incorporate inverse command would produced previous error
MISC--: this deterministic model motor learning suggests errors past movements subtracted off future motor plans
OWNX--: models traced at least helmholtz citation who used this type model describe perceptual constancy following eye movements
MISC--: however deterministic models fail recognize cns neither simply read off motor error noisy sensory signals nor produce identical motor outcomes repetitions motor commands
MISC--: relationships between sensory signal motor error between motor command motor outcome must inferred those inferences far certain
MISC--: recognizing this current research examined role uncertainty motor learning citation citation
MISC--: example sheidt et al citation added stochastic element average force field found subjects adapted uncertain field strength tracking its expectation over recent errors
OWNX--: here we interested response changes motor uncertainty ask whether responses result updating internal model motor variance if so aspects variance structure uncertain error signal modeled
MISC--: studies we increased motor noise anisotropically stimulating reflexive motor response known occur when reaching presence horizontal visual field motion drift citation
OWNX--: trial trial observers were shown leftward motion rightward motion static stimulus random order
MISC--: motion if present began at halfway point reach resulted perturbation reach direction visual motion
MISC--: subjects could not plan advance any particular drift condition since were randomly intermixed nor could they compensate drift online because timing reach drift onset insured reaches were completed before feedback correction was possible citation
AIMX--: because this reflexive manual following response affects only horizontal component reach was possible test aspects new anisotropic distribution motor errors was modeled cns
MISC--: we test changes internal representation motor noise monitoring changes reach plans toward visible targets depend details information available cns concerning motor uncertainty
MISC--: experiments successful reaches targets earn subjects monetary bonus reaches instead intersect neighboring region screen induce monetary loss
MISC--: two sessions each beginning reaches targets without penalties subjects learn their natural perturbed noise distributions then respond target penalty pairs later session allowing us assess their internal representation motor uncertainty
OWNX--: our results indicate cns updates strictly circular internal model motor variance even when distribution actual errors anisotropic
MISC--: this result consistent recent psychophysical neurophysiological results citation citation citation citation indicating independent encoding directions extents movement errors because system updates only circular internal representation errors equivalent system monitors only magnitudes those errors ignoring their directions
