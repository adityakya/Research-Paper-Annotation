MISC--: diversity virus populations within single infected hosts presents major difficulty natural immune response well vaccine design antiviral drug therapy
MISC--: recently developed pyrophosphate based sequencing technologies used quantifying this diversity ultra deep sequencing virus samples
AIMX--: we present computational methods analysis sequence data apply techniques pyrosequencing data obtained hiv populations within patients harboring drug resistant virus strains
OWNX--: our main result estimation population structure sample pyrosequencing reads
OWNX--: this inference based statistical approach error correction followed combinatorial algorithm constructing minimal set haplotypes explain data
OWNX--: using this set explaining haplotypes we apply statistical model infer frequencies haplotypes population via expectation maximization algorithm
OWNX--: we demonstrate pyrosequencing reads allow effective population reconstruction extensive simulations comparison sequences obtained directly clonal sequencing four independent diverse hiv populations
MISC--: thus pyrosequencing used cost effective estimation structure virus populations promising new insights into viral evolutionary dynamics disease control strategies
MISC--: pyrosequencing novel experimental technique determining sequence dna bases genome citation citation
MISC--: method faster less laborious cheaper than existing technologies but pyrosequencing reads also significantly shorter more error prone than those obtained sanger sequencing citation citation
AIMX--: this paper we address computational issues arise applying this technology sequencing rna virus sample
MISC--: within host rna virus populations consist different haplotypes evolutionarily related
MISC--: population exhibit high degree genetic diversity often referred quasispecies concept originally described mutation selection balance citation citation
MISC--: viral genetic diversity key factor disease progression citation citation vaccine design citation citation antiretroviral drug therapy citation citation
MISC--: ultra deep sequencing mixed virus samples promising approach quantifying this diversity resolving viral population structure citation citation
MISC--: pyrosequencing virus population produces many reads each originates exactly one but unknown haplotype population
OWNX--: thus central problem reconstruct read data set possible haplotypes consistent observed reads infer structure population i e relative frequency each haplotype
AIMX--: here we present computational four step procedure making inference about virus population based set pyrosequencing reads
OWNX--: first reads aligned reference genome
MISC--: second sequencing errors corrected locally windows along multiple alignment using clustering techniques
OWNX--: next we assemble haplotypes consistent observed reads
AIMX--: we formulate this problem search set covering paths directed acyclic graph show how search problem solved very efficiently
OWNX--: finally we introduce statistical model mimics sequencing process we employ maximum likelihood principle estimating frequency each haplotype population
MISC--: alignment step proposed procedure straightforward data analyzed here been discussed elsewhere citation
MISC--: due presence reference genome only pair wise alignment necessary between each read reference genome
OWNX--: we will therefore focus core methods error correction haplotype reconstruction haplotype frequency estimation
OWNX--: two independent approaches pursued validating proposed method
OWNX--: first we present extensive simulation results all steps method
OWNX--: second we validate procedure reconstructing four independent hiv populations pyrosequencing reads comparing populations results clonal sanger sequencing same samples
MISC--: datasets consist approximately reads average length bp sequenced kb region pol gene clinical samples hiv populations
MISC--: pyrosequencing produce up usable reads single run
OWNX--: part our contribution analysis interaction between number reads sequencing error rate theoretical resolution haplotype reconstruction
AIMX--: methods developed this paper scale huge datasets under reasonable assumptions
OWNX--: however we concentrate mainly sample size produces finer resolution than what typically obtained using limiting dilution clonal sequencing
OWNX--: since many samples run simultaneously independently this raises possibility obtaining data about populations one pyrosequencing run
MISC--: estimating viral population structure set reads general extremely hard computational problem because huge number possible haplotypes
MISC--: decoupling error correction haplotype reconstruction haplotype frequency estimation breaks this problem into three smaller more manageable tasks each also interest its own right
MISC--: presented methods not restricted rna virus populations but apply whenever reference genome available aligning reads read coverage sufficient genetic distance between haplotypes large enough
MISC--: clonal data indicates typical variation hiv pol gene about percent single patient citation
OWNX--: we find populations grow more diverse they become easier reconstruct
OWNX--: even at percent diversity we find much population reconstructed using our methods
MISC--: pol gene been sequenced extensively only one specific insertion seems occur namely insertion complex occurs under nrti pressure citation
OWNX--: none our samples were treated nrtis sanger clones did not display this indel
MISC--: therefore we assume throughout there no true indels population
AIMX--: however algorithms developed this paper generalize straightforward manner case true indels
MISC--: problem estimating population structure sequence reads similar assembly highly repetitive genome citation
OWNX--: however rather than reconstructing one genome we seek reconstruct population very similar genomes
MISC--: problem also related environmental sequencing projects try assess genomes all species community citation
MISC--: while associated computational biology problems related those appear other metagenomics projects citation novel approaches required deal short error prone pyrosequencing reads complex structure viral populations
MISC--: problem also similar haplotype reconstruction problem citation main difference being number haplotypes unknown advance estimating diversity alternative splicing citation
MISC--: more generally problem estimating diversity population genome sequence samples been studied extensively microbial populations
MISC--: example spectrum contig lengths been used estimate diversity shotgun sequencing data citation
MISC--: using pyrosequencing reads microbial diversity been assessed counting blast hits sequence databases citation
AIMX--: our methods differ previous work we show how analyze highly directed ultra deep sequencing data using rigorous mathematical statistical framework
