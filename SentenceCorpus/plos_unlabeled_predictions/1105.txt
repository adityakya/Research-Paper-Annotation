MISC--: experimental work shown t cells immune system rapidly specifically respond antigenic molecules presented surface antigen presenting cells able discriminate between potential stimuli based kinetic parameters t cell receptor antigen bond
MISC--: antigenic molecules presented among thousands chemically similar endogenous peptides raising question how t cells reliably make decision respond certain antigens but not others within minutes encountering antigen presenting cell
OWNX--: this theoretical study we investigate role localized rebinding between t cell receptor antigen
OWNX--: we show allowing signaling state individual receptors persist during brief unbinding events t cells able discriminate antigens based both their unbinding rebinding rates
OWNX--: we demonstrate t cell receptor coreceptors but not receptor clustering important promoting localized rebinding show requiring rebinding productive signaling reduces signals high concentration endogenous pmhc
OWNX--: developing our main results we use relatively simple model based kinetic proofreading
OWNX--: however we additionally show all our results recapitulated when we use detailed t cell receptor signaling model
OWNX--: we discuss our results context existing models recent experimental work propose new experiments test our findings

MISC--: scanning apcs t cells rapid estimates suggesting individual t cell spends only minutes interacting single apc if lacks specific pmhc citation
MISC--: experiments demonstrated t cells extremely sensitive specific pmhc responding few pmhc sea thousands chemically similar self pmhc citation citation citation citation
MISC--: also been demonstrated single amino acid substitution presented peptide dramatically alter t cell response citation
MISC--: speed sensitivity specificity been dubbed s characteristics antigen detection t cells citation
MISC--: observation t cells transiently interact apcs do not express specific pmhc suggests decision respond occurs within seconds encounter
MISC--: rapid turnover t cell apc contacts vivo accelerates search specific pmhc allowing numerous unique t cell apc interactions
MISC--: decision respond gives rise stop signal citation commonly followed formation immune synapse citation stable adhesion between t cell apc persists upwards minutes facilitates second sustained phase signaling
OWNX--: experiments mathematical modeling been extensively used understand efficiency t cell activation
MISC--: during sustained signaling phase serial binding many tcr single pmhc been postulated increase t cell sensitivity citation
MISC--: serial binding expected because bonds formed between tcr agonist pmhc transient half lives range s citation citation citation
MISC--: other hand t cell specificity been addressed kinetic proofreading model citation citation
MISC--: this model postulates series tcr proximal steps binding subsequent phosphorylation tcr associated immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs signaling molecules occur upon pmhc binding signaling events require continued tcr engagement proceed
MISC--: productive signal transduced only after several transformations taken place
MISC--: this model t cells able discriminate between different pmhc imposing threshold tcr pmhc dissociation rate constant
MISC--: combining serial binding kinetic proofreading reveals balance between sensitivity specificity gives rise optimal formula efficient t cell activation citation citation citation effect been experimentally observed citation citation citation
MISC--: efficiency t cell activation models others citation citation usually quantified number activated tcrs integrated over whole cell after relatively long period interaction apc
MISC--: additionally several studies reported correlations between tcr pmhc bond dissociation constant but not formula efficiency t cell activation measured after formula hour cytoxicity cytokine assays citation citation citation
MISC--: however t cells been observed respond stimulatory pmhc less than minute citation at least cytotoxic t cells stable contact interface not required pmhc detection citation
MISC--: serial binding kinetic proofreading models do not predict specificity short time scales part because signals generated high concentrations weakly binding self pmhc found comparable signals generated low concentrations high affinity agonist pmhc citation citation
MISC--: moreover early t cell response unlikely determined equilibrium parameter formula quite unlikely t cell apc interface attains equilibrium at short times
MISC--: more likely formula important determinant efficiency t cell activation during sustained phase signaling well after initial decision respond
AIMX--: this paper we investigate putative mechanism antigen discrimination during early phase tcr signaling
OWNX--: specifically we examine role tcr pmhc rebinding allowing t cells make rapid reliable decisions respond
OWNX--: explicitly accounting tcr pmhc rebinding within existing formulations diffusion limited membrane reactions we find rebinding very little effect canonical proofreading models
OWNX--: simple modification accounts signal persistence at tcr allows individual tcr integrate duration multiple rebinding events
OWNX--: consequence this scheme discrimination this sum binding model now sensitive both association dissociation rate constants tcr pmhc bond
OWNX--: this enhanced sensitivity leads finding t cell discriminate between wider spectrum antigens than would predicted traditional serial binding kinetic proofreading model
OWNX--: we further show coreceptors but not tcr clustering important achieve rapid rebinding events
OWNX--: addition we show signal persistence at tcr does not allow high concentrations endogenous pmhc generate spurious signals
OWNX--: finally we show our general conclusions unchanged when our cartoon kinetic proofreading model replaced detailed model tcr proximal signaling
OWNX--: we propose t cells discriminate antigen based formula formula via threshold sum binding allows rapid reliable t cell responses specific pmhc
