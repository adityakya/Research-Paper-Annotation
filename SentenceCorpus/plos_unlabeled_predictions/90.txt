MISC--: many proteins especially eukaryotes contain tandem repeats several domains same family
MISC--: repeats variety binding properties involved protein protein interactions well binding other ligands dna rna
MISC--: rapid expansion protein domain repeats assumed evolved through internal tandem duplications
CONT--: however exact mechanisms behind tandem duplications not well understood
AIMX--: here we studied evolution function protein structure gene structure phylogenetic distribution domain repeats
OWNX--: this purpose we assigned pfam domain families proteomes more sensitive domain assignments repeat regions
MISC--: assignments confirmed previous findings eukaryotes particular vertebrates contain much higher fraction proteins repeats compared prokaryotes
MISC--: internal sequence similarity each protein revealed domain repeats often expanded through duplications several domains at time while duplication one domain less common
MISC--: many repeats appear been duplicated middle repeat region
OWNX--: this strong contrast evolution other proteins mainly works through additions single domains at either terminus
OWNX--: further we found some domain families show distinct duplication patterns e g nebulin domains mainly been expanded unit seven domains at time while duplications other domain families involve varying numbers domains
MISC--: finally no common mechanism expansion all repeats could detected
OWNX--: we found duplication patterns show no dependence size domains
OWNX--: further repeat expansion some families possibly explained shuffling exons
OWNX--: however exon shuffling could not created all repeats
MISC--: proteins composed domains recurrent protein fragments distinct structure function evolutionary history
MISC--: protein domains may occur alone but more frequently found combination other domains multidomain proteins
MISC--: while creation new multidomain architectures through shuffling protein domains been studied extensively during last few years citation citation one type domain recombination often been ignored creation domain repeats
MISC--: domain repeats contain two more domains same domain family tandem
MISC--: large repeats more then ten domains tandem common eukaryotes
MISC--: repeating domains often short leucine rich repeat family repeating unit residues
MISC--: some repeated domain families mainly found repeats e g lrr c h zinc fingers while other families also frequently found single unit
MISC--: repeats may form regular structures antiparallel sheets solenoids while others form filaments only structured upon binding their ligands citation
MISC--: some examples repeats protein structures found propeat database
MISC--: single amino acids short peptide motifs may repeated proteins too
OWNX--: however this study we focused larger repeating units domains
MISC--: therefore when repeats mentioned this text refers repeats protein domains
MISC--: domain repeats often involved interactions proteins other ligands dna rna
MISC--: even if repeated domains well defined conserved structure sequence conservation often low only few conserved residues required correct fold
MISC--: their variable sequences variation number domains provide flexible binding multiple binding partners
MISC--: hence repeats found proteins highly diverse functions tetratrico peptide repeats involved cell cycle regulation transcriptional regulation protein transport assisting protein folding citation
MISC--: addition flexible binding properties sequence variability repeats been exploited create high affinity binders alternative antibodies citation
MISC--: domain repeats found all kingdoms life long repeats containing several domains tandem been observed particularly common multicellular species citation citation
OWNX--: repeats been proposed provide eukaryotes extra source variability compensate low generation rates citation
MISC--: one example lrrs plant defense systems enable plants adapt new pathogens citation
MISC--: domain repeats thought arise via tandem duplications within gene citation where segment duplicated copy inserted next its origin
CONT--: however exact mechanism behind this phenomenon not fully understood
OWNX--: nonhomologous recombination intron regions i e exon shuffling may responsible internal duplications repeats this issue been addressed this study
MISC--: another possible explanation dna slippage due formation dna hairpins common creation nucleotide repeats short protein repeats citation
MISC--: however marcotte coworkers shown protein repeats more likely created recombination than dna slippage since repeat expansion shows weak dependence repeat length citation
OWNX--: addition internal duplications frequent duplications repeat containing genes occurred mammalian genomes citation
MISC--: this part explain their abundance higher eukaryotes
MISC--: addition variation number repeats between orthologous genes indicates loss gain domains repeats frequent evolution citation
MISC--: interestingly rapid expansion repeats eukaryotes could partly explained tandem duplication units containing several repeated domains citation citation
OWNX--: this study we aim investigate how frequent duplications multiple domains
MISC--: further number domains duplicated compared among different domain families
MISC--: domains defined pfam database citation were detected using hmm alignments
MISC--: coverage was increased relaxed detection criteria domains repeated regions proteins
MISC--: addition investigation duplication sizes domain assignments been used study distribution repeats repeated domain families three kingdoms life position repeat expansion location exon boundaries repeats
