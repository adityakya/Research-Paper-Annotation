MISC--: dominant paradigm describing functioning proteins well defined structured molecular machines undergoing concerted conformational changes while carrying out their function citation citation
MISC--: however over past few years become clear reality much more complex there proteins simply do not defined tertiary structure yet still carry out multitudes different important functions
MISC--: intrinsically disordered proteins protein segments also called natively unfolded natively disordered definition difficult study using classical methods structural biology but they recent years received significant attention largely due two facts citation citation
