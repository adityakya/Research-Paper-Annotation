MISC--: structure protein determines its function
MISC--: knowledge structure therefore used guide design drugs improve interpretation other information locations mutations identify remote protein homologs
MISC--: indirect methods x ray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy required determine tertiary structure protein
MISC--: membrane proteins essential variety processes including small molecule transport signaling significant biological interest
CONT--: however they not easily amenable existing crystallization methods even though some most difficult problems this area been overcome recent years number known tertiary structures membrane structures remains very low
MISC--: computational methods accurately predict basic topology transmembrane proteins easily available information therefore continue great interest
CONT--: most valuable predicted topology include not only locations membrane spanning segments but should also correctly localize n c termini relative membrane
MISC--: many proteins include short n terminal signal peptide initially directs post translational transport protein across membrane subsequently cleaved off after transport
MISC--: signal peptide includes strongly hydrophobic segment not part mature protein but often misclassified membrane spanning portion transmembrane protein
MISC--: conversely transmembrane protein membrane spanning segment near n terminus often misclassified having signal peptide
MISC--: therefore signal peptide prediction transmembrane topology prediction should performed simultaneously rather than being treated two separate tasks
MISC--: membrane proteins classically divided into two structural classes those traverse membrane using helical bundle bacteriorhodopsin those use barrel porin
OWNX--: barrel motif found only small fraction all membrane proteins
MISC--: lately some attention been given some irregular structures re entrant loops random coil regions
MISC--: this work however we focus helical class both because most membrane proteins fall into this class because they constitute most known d structures
MISC--: two most common machine learning approaches applied prediction both signal peptides topology transmembrane proteins hidden markov models artificial neural networks while some predictors use combination two approaches
MISC--: hmms particularly well suited sequence labeling tasks task specific prior knowledge encoded into structure hmm while anns learn make classification decisions based hundreds inputs
MISC--: first hmm based transmembrane protein topology predictors were introduced ten years ago tmhmm citation hmmtop citation
MISC--: both predictors define set structural classes capture variation amino acid composition different portions membrane protein
MISC--: example membrane spanning helix known highly hydrophobic cytoplasmic loops generally contain more positively charged amino acids than non cytoplasmic loops
MISC--: during training hmm learns set emission distributions one each structural classes
CONT--: tmhmm trained using two pass discriminative training approach followed decoding using one best algorithm citation
MISC--: hmmtop introduced hypothesis difference between amino acid distributions various structural classes main driving force determining final protein topology therefore most likely topology one maximizes this difference given protein
MISC--: hmmtop citation was also first allow constrained decoding incorporate additional evidence regarding localization one more positions within protein sequence
MISC--: presence signal peptide within given protein also been successfully predicted using both hmms citation anns citation

OWNX--: we also introduce set confidence measures at three different levels at level protein type at level individual topology segment at level full topology
BASE--: confidence measures topology predictions were introduced mel n et al citation we expand upon this work three types scores correlate well observed precision
MISC--: finally based philius predictions entire yeast resource center citation protein database we provide overview relative percentages different types proteins different organisms well composition class membrane proteins
MISC--: transmembrane protein topology prediction stated supervised learning problem over amino acid sequences
MISC--: training set consists pairs sequences form where o o o n sequence amino acids protein known topology s s s n corresponding sequence labels
MISC--: o i drawn alphabet amino acids formula s i drawn alphabet topology labels formula corresponding respectively cytoplasmic loops membrane spanning segments non cytoplasmic loops signal peptides
