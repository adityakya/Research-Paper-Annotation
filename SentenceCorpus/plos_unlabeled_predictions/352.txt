MISC--: noncoding rnas important functional rnas do not code proteins
OWNX--: we present highly efficient computational pipeline discovering cis regulatory ncrna motifs de novo
MISC--: pipeline differs previous methods structure oriented does not require multiple sequence alignment input capable detecting rna motifs low sequence conservation
OWNX--: we also integrate rna motif prediction rna homolog search improves quality rna motifs significantly
OWNX--: here we report results applying this pipeline firmicute bacteria
OWNX--: our top ranking motifs include most known firmicute elements found rna family database
OWNX--: comparing our motif models rfam s hand curated motif models we achieve high accuracy both membership prediction base pair level secondary structure prediction
OWNX--: ncrna candidates not rfam we find compelling evidence some them functional analyze several potential ribosomal protein leaders depth
MISC--: recent discoveries novel noncoding rnas micrornas riboswitches suggest ncrnas important diverse functional regulatory roles impact gene transcription translation localization replication degradation citation citation
MISC--: last few years several groups performed genome scale computational ncrna predictions based comparative genomic analysis
MISC--: particular barrick et al citation used pairwise blast based approach discover novel riboswitch candidates bacterial genomes many now been experimentally verified
MISC--: similar studies been conducted various bacterial groups citation citation
MISC--: more recent work extended searches eukaryotes citation citation discovering large number known micrornas while producing thousands novel ncrna candidates
MISC--: some exceptions citation citation approaches follow similar paradigm search conserved secondary structures multiple sequence alignments constructed based sequence similarity alone
MISC--: typically schemes use measures mutual information between pairs alignment columns signal base paired regions
MISC--: however signals methods seek namely compensatory base pair mutations exactly signals may cause sequence based alignment methods misalign alternatively refuse align homologous ncrna sequences
CONT--: even local misalignments may weaken this key structural signal making methods sensitive alignment quality especially problematic diverged sequences
AIMX--: this paper we present novel structure oriented computational pipeline genome scale prediction cis regulatory ncrnas
MISC--: exploits but does not require sequence conservation
MISC--: pipeline differs previous methods three respects
OWNX--: first searches unaligned upstream sequences homologous genes instead well aligned regions constructed sequence based methods
BASE--: second we predict rna motifs unaligned sequences using tool called cmfinder citation very sensitive rna motifs low sequence conservation robust inclusion long flanking regions unrelated sequences
OWNX--: finally we integrate rna motif prediction rna homology search
OWNX--: every predicted motif we scan genome database more homologs then used refine model
OWNX--: this iterative process improves model expands motif families automatically
OWNX--: this study we apply this pipeline discover ncrna elements prokaryotes
OWNX--: we chose prokaryotes mainly because large number fully sequenced genomes great sequence divergence among species well exploited our approach
OWNX--: our approach two key advantages
OWNX--: first efficient highly automated
MISC--: earlier steps more computationally efficient than later steps we apply filters between steps so poor candidates eliminated subsequent analysis
MISC--: thus even though we use some computationally expensive algorithms pipeline scalable larger problems
OWNX--: besides providing rna motif prediction pipeline also integrates gene context functional analysis facilitates manual biological evaluation
MISC--: second this pipeline highly accurate finding prokaryotic ncrnas especially rna cis regulatory elements
OWNX--: demonstrate performance this approach we report our search results firmicutes gram positive bacterial division includes bacillus subtilis relatively well studied model organism many known ncrnas
OWNX--: method exhibits low false positive rates negative controls low false negative rates known firmicute ncrnas
MISC--: rna family database citation partially hand curated database noncoding rnas includes ncrna families categorized cis regulatory elements representatives b subtilis
OWNX--: included among our top predictions th appears somewhat lower our ranking
OWNX--: two other rfam families also represented among our top predictions
OWNX--: addition both secondary structure prediction identified family members excellent agreement rfam annotation
