MISC--: accumulated experimental observations demonstrate protein stability often preserved upon conservative point mutation
MISC--: contrast less known about effects large sequence structure changes stability particular fold
MISC--: almost completely unknown degree stability different regions protein generally preserved throughout evolution
MISC--: this work questions addressed through thermodynamic analysis large representative sample protein fold space based remote yet accepted homology
OWNX--: more than proteins were computationally analyzed using structural thermodynamic algorithm corex best
OWNX--: estimated position specific stability its component enthalpy entropy were quantitatively compared between all proteins sample according all vs all pairwise structural alignment
MISC--: was discovered local stabilities homologous pairs were significantly more correlated than those non homologous pairs indicating local stability was indeed generally conserved throughout evolution
CONT--: however position specific enthalpy entropy underlying stability were less correlated suggesting overall regional stability protein was more important than thermodynamic mechanism utilized achieve stability
OWNX--: finally two different types statistically exceptional evolutionary structure thermodynamic relationships were noted
MISC--: first many homologous proteins contained regions similar thermodynamics despite localized structure change suggesting thermodynamic mechanism enabling evolutionary fold change
OWNX--: second some homologous proteins extremely similar structures nonetheless exhibited different local stabilities phenomenon previously observed experimentally this laboratory
MISC--: two observations conjunction principal conclusion homologous proteins generally conserved local stability may provide guidance future thermodynamically informed classification protein homology
MISC--: protein structure function ultimately determined thermodynamics
MISC--: example anfinsen s seminal work citation demonstrated native state protein exists at minimum gibbs free energy stability under physiological conditions
MISC--: binding catalysis also governed free energy sign magnitude free energy change each functional reaction controls reaction s direction equilibrium extent respectively citation citation
MISC--: gibbs free energy results summed often opposing contributions enthalpy entropy g h t s generally case proteins changes free energy small compared underlying enthalpic entropic changes citation
MISC--: reactions dominated either enthalpy entropy but most often case sometimes delicate balance between enthalpy entropy controls protein structure function
MISC--: unfortunately goal thermodynamic characterization protein folds each quantities challenging accurately predict
MISC--: while enthalpy rationalized terms information derived atomic coordinates citation entropy harder estimate frequently requiring knowledge not apparent single structure information about conformational degeneracy protein citation citation
MISC--: equally challenging task developing robust analysis reports position specific stability within protein rather than reporting either energetic contribution residue stability protein whole
MISC--: due part inherent difficulty accurately computing global local enthalpy entropy free energy all protein structure classification strategies we aware do not incorporate thermodynamic information
OWNX--: our hypothesis this theoretical omission limits complete understanding protein fold space
MISC--: there may also practical consequences omission
MISC--: example possible thermodynamic information protein observable independent sequence structure citation could improve computational tools sequence alignment fold recognition citation homology detection thereby clarifying discrepancies existing classification schemes based only sequence structure
MISC--: thermodynamic information may also yield new understanding not available current schemes about evolutionary sequence structure functional relationships citation
MISC--: one particularly important yet unanswered question degree protein stability its components conserved during fold evolution does concept thermodynamic homology meaningfully exist beyond conservative point mutations
MISC--: step towards integration thermodynamic information into existing protein classification schemes local free energy stability enthalpy entropy here computed large representative database protein domains using previously described corex best algorithm citation citation
MISC--: importantly diverse proteins studied accepted evolutionary relationships citation expertly curated citation any homologs remote
MISC--: thus experimental design trivial comparisons between thermodynamics closely related proteins explicitly excluded this analysis
MISC--: central aim this work assess degree thermodynamic conservation among remotely homologous protein domains
MISC--: three findings relating thermodynamics protein sequence structure reported
