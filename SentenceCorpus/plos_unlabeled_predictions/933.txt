MISC--: new monotonicity constrained maximum likelihood approach called partial order optimum likelihood presented applied problem functional site prediction protein d structures important current challenge genomics
MISC--: input consists electrostatic geometric properties derived d structure query protein alone
MISC--: sequence based conservation information where available may also incorporated
MISC--: electrostatics features thematics combined multidimensional isotonic regression form maximum likelihood estimates probabilities specific residues belong active site
MISC--: this allows likelihood ranking all ionizable residues given protein based thematics features
MISC--: corresponding roc curves statistical significance tests demonstrate this method outperforms prior thematics based methods turn been shown previously outperform other d structure based methods identifying active site residues
OWNX--: then shown addition one simple geometric property size rank cleft given residue contained yields improved performance
MISC--: extension method include predictions non ionizable residues achieved through introduction environment variables
AIMX--: this extension results even better performance than thematics alone constitutes date best functional site predictor based d structure only achieving nearly same level performance methods use both d structure sequence alignment data
MISC--: finally method also easily incorporates sequence alignment data when this information included resulting method shown outperform best current methods using any combination sequence alignments d structures
MISC--: included analysis demonstrating when thematics features cleft size rank alignment based conservation scores used individually combination thematics features represent single most important component classifiers
MISC--: development function prediction capabilities major challenge genomics
OWNX--: structural genomics projects determining d structures expressed proteins high throughput basis
MISC--: however determination function d structure proved challenging task functions most structural genomics proteins remain unknown
MISC--: computationally based predictive methods help guide accelerate functional annotation
MISC--: first step toward prediction function protein its d structure determine its local site interaction where catalysis ligand recognition occurs
MISC--: capabilities many important practical implications biology medicine
OWNX--: we reported thematics citation citation theoretical microscopic titration curves technique prediction local interaction sites protein its three dimensional structure alone
MISC--: application thematics one begins d structure query protein solves poisson boltzmann equations using well established methods then performs hybrid procedure compute proton occupations ionizable sites functions ph
MISC--: residues involved catalysis recognition different chemical properties ordinary residues
MISC--: particular functionally important residues anomalous theoretical proton occupation curves
MISC--: thematics exploits this difference utilizes information shapes theoretical titration curves ionizable residues calculated approximately computed electrical potential function
MISC--: thematics utilizes only d structure query protein input neither sequence alignments nor structural comparisons used
MISC--: recently was shown citation among methods based d structure query protein only thematics achieves far best performance measured sensitivity precision annotated catalytic residues
AIMX--: purpose present paper five fold we present monotonicity constrained maximum likelihood approach called partial order optimum likelihood improve performance expand capabilities active site prediction
MISC--: then shown pool thematics input data alone outperforms previous statistical citation support vector machine citation implementations thematics when applied test set annotated protein structures
OWNX--: then demonstrated inclusion one additional d structure based feature representing ordinal size surface cleft each residue belongs result some improved performance demonstrated roc curves validated wilcoxon signed rank tests
MISC--: introduction environment features pool then use thematics data predict both ionizable non ionizable residues
AIMX--: this all residues extension thematics together cleft size rank feature results simple d structure based functional site predictor performs better than other d structure based methods nearly well very best current methods utilize both d structure sequence homology
MISC--: finally pool approach able take advantage sequence alignment based conservation scores when available addition structure based features
MISC--: when this additional information included resulting classifier shown outperform all other currently available methods using any combination structure sequence information
MISC--: prior implementations thematics identification active site residues d structure query protein citation citation titration curve shapes were described moments their first derivative functions
OWNX--: first derivative functions essentially probability density functions give unity when integrated over all space
MISC--: ko et al citation third fourth central moments probability functions were used
MISC--: moments measure asymmetry roughly area under tails relative area near mean respectively
MISC--: tong et al citation first moment second central moment were also used
MISC--: each approaches moments measure deviations normal curve shape analyses identify outliers residues deviate most normal proton occupation behavior
MISC--: prior approaches all use spatial clustering so outlier residues reported positive method if only if they sufficiently close spatial proximity at least one other outlier
OWNX--: thus previous thematics identifications involve two stages where first stage makes binary decision each residue second stage finds spatial clusters outliers
MISC--: new approach reported here every residue assigned probability active site residue
OWNX--: here alternative clustering approach we introduce features describe residue s neighbors we call environment features
MISC--: given scalar feature x we define value environment feature x env given residue r formulawhere r ionizable residue whose distance d residue r less than weight w given d
OWNX--: this study we use same features used ko citation approach along additional features env env
MISC--: thus every ionizable residue any protein structure assigned dimensional feature vector
CONT--: present approach number advantages
MISC--: specifically active residues may selected one step they rank ordered according probability involvement active site
CONT--: furthermore while thematics previously been applied ionizable residues only present approach opens door direct prediction non ionizable active site residues because environment features env env well defined all residues including non ionizable ones
CONT--: finally additional geometric features obtainable d structure only may readily combined four thematics features order enhance performance
MISC--: geometric features relative sizes clefts surface protein structure been shown correlate active site location citation citation
OWNX--: instance majority single chain proteins catalytic residues largest cleft
CONT--: however geometric features alone do not perform comparatively well active residue prediction particularly because they not very selective
MISC--: shown here cleft size information combined thematics electrostatic features yields high performance purely d structure based functional site predictions
