MISC--: widely believed modular organization cellular function reflected modular structure molecular networks
MISC--: common view module network cohesively linked group nodes densely connected internally sparsely interacting rest network
MISC--: many algorithms try identify functional modules protein interaction networks searching cohesive groups proteins
OWNX--: here we present alternative approach independent any prior definition what actually constitutes module
MISC--: self consistent manner proteins grouped into functional roles if they interact similar ways other proteins according their functional roles
MISC--: grouping may well result cohesive modules again but only if network structure actually supports this
BASE--: we applied our method pin human protein reference database found representation network terms cohesive modules at least global scale does not optimally represent network s structure because focuses finding independent groups proteins
MISC--: contrast decomposition into functional roles able depict structure much better also takes into account interdependencies between roles even allows groupings based absence interactions between proteins same functional role
MISC--: this example case transmembrane proteins could never recognized cohesive group nodes pin
OWNX--: when mapping experimental methods onto groups we identified profound differences coverage suggesting our method able capture experimental bias data too
OWNX--: example yeast two hybrid data were highly overrepresented one particular group
MISC--: thus there more structure protein interaction networks than cohesive modules alone we believe this finding significantly improve automated function prediction algorithms
MISC--: biological function believed organized modular hierarchical fashion citation
BASE--: genes make proteins proteins form cells cells form organs organs form organisms organisms form populations populations form ecosystems
CONT--: while higher levels this hierarchy well understood genetic code been deciphered unraveling inner workings proteome poses one greatest challenges post genomic era citation
MISC--: development high throughput experimental techniques delineation protein protein interactions well modern data warehousing technologies make data available searchable key steps towards understanding architecture eventually function cellular network
MISC--: data now allow searching functional modules within networks computational approaches putatively assigning protein function
MISC--: recent review sharan et al citation surveys current methods network based prediction methods protein function
MISC--: proteins must interact function
MISC--: hence we expect protein function encoded protein interaction network
MISC--: basic underlying assumption all methods automated functional annotation pairwise interaction strong indication common function
MISC--: sharan et al differentiate two basic approaches network based function prediction direct methods seen local methods applying guilt association principle citation immediate second neighbors network module assisted methods first cluster network into modules according some definition then annotate proteins inside module based known annotations other proteins module
MISC--: so instead guilt association one could speak kin liability
MISC--: latter approach function prediction necessitates concept what considered module network
MISC--: most researchers consider cohesive sets proteins highly connected internally but only sparsely rest network citation citation
MISC--: methods yielded considerable success at level very small scale modules particular protein complexes
MISC--: concept module group cohesively interacting proteins also useful larger scales
MISC--: some researchers argued modularity this sense universal principle small cohesive modules combine form larger cohesive entities nested hierarchy citation citation
MISC--: but this view really adequate describe architecture protein interactions
MISC--: recently wang zhang citation questioned whether cohesive clusters protein interaction networks carry biological information at all suggested simple network growth model based gene duplication would produce observed structural cohesiveness evolutionary byproduct without biological significance
MISC--: we will not go far questioning content biological information network structure but rather argue against model cohesively linked group nodes network adequate proxy functional module all scales network
MISC--: consider first example protein complexes
MISC--: indeed they consist proteins working together experimentally isolated together
MISC--: only large scale analysis protein complexes citation citation revealed they more dynamic than previously assumed
MISC--: many proteins not only found single but multitude complexes
MISC--: information about proteins connecting complexes will lost when searching only cohesively interacting groups proteins
MISC--: second example consider transmembrane proteins like receptors signal transduction cascades
MISC--: they tend interact many different cytoplasmic proteins well their extra cellular ligands
MISC--: still only rarely do different transmembrane receptors interact each other
MISC--: thus functional class transmembrane receptors will not identified when looking cohesive modules
AIMX--: here we ask whether features not discovered algorithms searching cohesive modules also present overall structure cellular network
MISC--: if this case methods searching only cohesive modules would not able identify them
MISC--: we group proteins self consistently into functional roles if they interact similar ways other proteins according their functional roles
MISC--: role may well cohesive module meaning proteins this class predominantly interact other proteins this class but does not
OWNX--: other words we do not impose structure cohesive modules network our analysis but rather find structural representation best supported data
MISC--: using abstraction functional role we generate image graph original network depicts only predominant interactions among classes proteins thus allowing bird s eye view network
MISC--: case protein interaction network studied here we found sound evidence cohesive modules global scale do not adequately represent network s global structure
OWNX--: we found cohesive groups proteins acting intermediates specifically connecting other groups proteins
OWNX--: furthermore we even identified groups proteins only sparsely connected within themselves but similar patterns interaction other proteins
CONT--: thus approaches searching only cohesive modules sparsely connected rest network might not sufficient represent all characteristics cellular networks
OWNX--: our findings suggest hierarchical modularity nested cohesively interacting groups proteins reconsidered universal organizing principle
MISC--: cases does clustering network into cohesive modules not reflect its original architecture
MISC--: consider toy network figure there four known types proteins this network
MISC--: type formula may represents some biological process involving five proteins connected four proteins type formula
MISC--: linked another biological process formula involves five further proteins finally linked four proteins type formula
MISC--: not all nodes same type necessarily share same set neighbors
MISC--: some nodes same type do not any neighbors common nodes their type more neighbors common nodes different type
MISC--: this shows this hypothetical example direct methods functional annotations may limited their accuracy
MISC--: clustering network into cohesive modules cannot capture full structure network
MISC--: nodes type b will never recognized proper cluster because they not connected internally at all
MISC--: structure example network however perfectly captured simple image graph nodes
MISC--: nodes image graph correspond types nodes network
MISC--: nodes type formula connected other nodes type formula nodes type formula
MISC--: nodes type formula connections nodes types formula formula so forth
MISC--: concept defining types nodes their relation other types nodes known regular equivalence social sciences citation citation
MISC--: structure recognition networks then seen finding best fitting image graph network
MISC--: this context clustering into functional modules means representing network image graph consisting isolated self linking nodes
MISC--: once assignment nodes into classes obtained rows columns incidence matrix reordered rows columns corresponding nodes same class adjacent
MISC--: ordering rows columns representing nodes same class random
MISC--: this leads characteristic structure dense blocks adjacency matrix corresponding links image graph sparse zero blocks corresponding links absent image graph
MISC--: structure recognition networks therefore also called block modeling together concepts structural regular equivalence long history social sciences citation citation
OWNX--: our further discussion we will denote image graphs consist only isolated self linked nodes figure b diagonal image graphs due block structure along diagonal adjacency matrix they induce
OWNX--: accordingly we will call all other image graphs non diagonal image graphs
