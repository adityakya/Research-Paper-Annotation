OWNX--: integrative approaches studying coupled dynamics skeletal muscles their loads while under neural control focused largely questions pertaining postural dynamical stability animals humans
MISC--: prior studies focused how central nervous system actively modulates muscle mechanical impedance generate stabilize motion posture
MISC--: however question whether muscle impedance properties neurally modulated create favorable mechanical energetics particularly context periodic tasks remains open
OWNX--: through muscle stiffness tuning we hypothesize pair antagonist muscles acting against common load may produce significantly more power synergistically than individually when impedance matching conditions met between muscle load
OWNX--: since neurally modulated muscle stiffness contributes coupled muscle load stiffness we further anticipate power optimal oscillation frequencies will occur at frequencies greater than natural frequency load
MISC--: hypotheses were evaluated computationally applying optimal control methods bilinear muscle model also evaluated through vitro measurements frog plantaris longus muscles acting individually pairs upon mass spring damper load
OWNX--: we find fold increase mechanical power when antagonist muscles act synergistically compared individually at frequency higher than load natural frequency
OWNX--: observed behaviors interpreted context resonance tuning engineering notion impedance matching
MISC--: findings suggest central nervous system adopt strategies harness inherent muscle impedance relation external loads attain favorable mechanical energetics
MISC--: capability skeletal muscles deliver mechanical power key determining neuromechanical performance envelope organisms

OWNX--: integrative approaches been proposed capture interaction all subsets factors
MISC--: example connection between muscle impedance neural control been studied depth respect postural dynamic stability citation citation locomotory functions citation citation manipulation citation citation other biomechanical tasks citation
BASE--: this work we adhere definition muscle mechanical impedance static dynamic relation between muscle force imposed stretch citation
MISC--: muscle impedance encompasses muscle stiffness static relation between muscle force stretch only
MISC--: context muscle energetics most investigations focused experimentally measuring power output individual muscles at range frequencies phases electrical stimulation parameters finding maximal power generating capability muscles under prescribed motion trajectories
OWNX--: however role muscle load interaction output energetics not been formalized
MISC--: central premise this work mechanical energetics muscle actuated system cannot determined meaningful manner without considering coupling muscle properties load dynamics neural activation
OWNX--: considering this coupling explicitly we arrive at phenomena cannot captured using standard workloop testing methodologies including opportunity harness muscle load interaction energetically advantageous manner
MISC--: muscle energetics been characterized under dynamic conditions both vitro citation vivo citation citation citation
MISC--: vitro measurements relied almost invariably workloop technique citation
MISC--: this approach isolated muscles subjected predetermined periodic length variations time means external motion source
MISC--: at given phase imposed oscillation electrical stimulus delivered synchronously resulting periodic muscle contractions
MISC--: plot muscle contractile force versus displacement results cyclic workloop integrated area within loop being measure net muscle work done
MISC--: similar measurements been reproduced muscle physiology literature various muscle groups within various organisms citation citation connections between muscle function its mechanical energetics been made citation citation
CONT--: while measurements provide useful energetic connections muscle function experimental conditions do not capture representative vivo conditions because motion profiles imposed single isolated muscles no muscle load interactions citation without incorporating effects antagonist activity
MISC--: vivo measurements other hand capture all above effects principle but lack experimental flexibility varying load conditions unambiguous manner
OWNX--: capturing effect muscle load interaction muscle energetics critical
OWNX--: this interaction captured considering impedance muscles relation impedance load
MISC--: when group muscles acts common load exemplified antagonist pair acting common load each muscle forms part load borne other muscles its group
OWNX--: because muscle impedance activation dependent neural control used modulate effective load observed each muscle modulating impedance opposing muscles thereby offering opportunity create favorable impedance conditions maximize power transfer external environmental load
OWNX--: this akin notion impedance matching engineering systems where driving source load matched provide optimal power transfer
MISC--: context neuromuscular control impedance matching enable groups muscles work synergistically provide significantly higher energetics than sum individual muscles
OWNX--: consequently this investigation we studied influence muscle load interaction muscle workloop energetics both computationally experimentally
OWNX--: we set up model problem consisting mass spring damper system actuated either single muscle pair symmetric antagonist muscles
MISC--: input system modulate net force exerted two muscles well net impedance
OWNX--: context this problem we investigated two hypothesis
MISC--: hypothesis states power optimal oscillation frequency muscle actuated system greater than resonance frequency load
MISC--: this direct contrast impedance free actuator where optimal oscillation frequency occurs exactly at resonance load
MISC--: hypothesis states pair antagonist muscles work together produce more power synergistically than individually margins cannot predicted without explicit incorporation muscle impedance
OWNX--: we tested hypotheses both computationally experimentally
OWNX--: our computational approach relied optimal control solutions workloop maximization problem was based mathematical model problem
