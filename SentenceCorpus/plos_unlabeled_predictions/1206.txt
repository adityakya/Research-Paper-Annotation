MISC--: threshold firing frequency neuron characterizing feature its dynamical behaviour turn determining its role oscillatory activity brain
OWNX--: two main types dynamics been identified brain neurons
AIMX--: type dynamics shows continuous relationship between frequency stimulation current thus arbitrarily low frequency at threshold current type shows discontinuous f i stim relationship minimum threshold frequency
AIMX--: previous study hippocampal neuron model we demonstrated its dynamics could both type type depending ion channel density

OWNX--: moreover we analyse hippocampal neuron model more detail
OWNX--: models all based voltage clamp studies thus comprising experimentally measurable parameters
MISC--: choice analysing effects channel density modifications due their physiological pharmacological relevance
AIMX--: we show using bifurcation analysis both axon models display exclusively type dynamics independently ion channel density
MISC--: nevertheless both models region channel density plane characterized n shaped steady state current voltage relationship
OWNX--: summary our results suggest hippocampal soma two axon membranes represent two distinct kinds membranes membranes channel density dependent switching between type dynamics membranes channel density independent dynamics
OWNX--: difference between two membrane types suggests functional differences compatible more flexible role soma membrane than axon membrane
MISC--: now more than years since alan hodgkin categorized firing behaviour his classical study isolated axons crab carcinus maenas citation
MISC--: many respects his experiments still form basis analysis firing patterns nervous systems
MISC--: using threshold dynamics maximum frequency parameters he identified two major classes repetitively firing axons class axons start firing very low frequency at threshold stimulation yielding continuous f i stim relationship whereas class axons start firing abruptly relatively high frequency at threshold yielding discontinuous f i stim relationship
MISC--: basis similar categorization mammalian cortical neurons also been separated into main classes citation citation one exhibiting class characteristics another class characteristics
MISC--: former class consists primarily pyramidal neurons latter primarily interneurons
MISC--: this differential classification excitability been shown correlate differential bifurcation behaviour corresponding dynamical models citation citation successfully been used analysing coding properties neurons citation citation
AIMX--: avoid confusion accordance notation tateno robinson citation we following use terms type type dynamics when referring continuous discontinuous f i stim relationships respectively
MISC--: this classification takes threshold dynamics regular fast spiking neurons class axons into account but not all behavioural aspects classes citation
MISC--: intricate interactions between many factors involved dynamical regulation neuronal firing poorly understood citation
MISC--: dominant idea different combinations ion channel types explain different patterns citation

OWNX--: model used was four dimensional based detailed experimental voltage clamp study thus comprising experimentally estimated parameters
MISC--: choice ion channel densities bifurcation parameters was due their physiological pharmacological relevance
OWNX--: many drugs act specifically blocking channels thereby reducing ion channel density both at somatic at axonal level

MISC--: bifurcation analysis showed type dynamics model due saddle node invariant circle bifurcations citation citation
OWNX--: figure portrays bifurcation v i stim plot calculated model using region c values
MISC--: type dynamics was found due either local andronov hopf bifurcations global double limit cycle bifurcations citation citation
MISC--: dynamics model associated region b values due double limit cycle subcritical andronov hopf bifurcations while dynamics associated region exclusively due double limit cycle bifurcations
MISC--: double limit cycle bifurcation implies unstable limit cycle part separating structure separates trajectories turning central stable point those approaching stable limit cycle
MISC--: however preliminary calculations suggested bifurcation structure at border between regions b c more complex than previously described
