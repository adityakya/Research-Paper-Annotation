MISC--: scientific literature represents rich source retrieval knowledge associations between biomedical concepts genes diseases cellular processes
OWNX--: commonly used method establish relationships between biomedical concepts literature co occurrence
OWNX--: apart its use knowledge retrieval co occurrence method also well suited discover new hidden relationships between biomedical concepts following simple abc principle c no direct relationship but connected via shared b intermediates
AIMX--: this paper we describe copub discovery tool mines literature new relationships between biomedical concepts
MISC--: statistical analysis using roc curves showed copub discovery performed well over wide range settings keyword thesauri
OWNX--: we subsequently used copub discovery search new relationships between genes drugs pathways diseases
BASE--: several newly found relationships were validated using independent literature sources
OWNX--: addition new predicted relationships between compounds cell proliferation were validated confirmed experimentally vitro cell proliferation assay
OWNX--: results show copub discovery able identify novel associations between genes drugs pathways diseases high probability being biologically valid
MISC--: this makes copub discovery useful tool unravel mechanisms behind disease find novel drug targets find novel applications existing drugs
MISC--: wealth knowledge concerning function genes their role biological processes present biomedical literature embodied full text articles medline abstract database
MISC--: various text mining approaches been developed extract information gene function this body literature citation citation been successfully applied annotate genes proteins citation citation interpretation experimental results citation citation
OWNX--: common method establish relationships between biomedical concepts genes pathways co occurrence citation
OWNX--: this method built assumption biomedical concepts occurring same body text some way biologically related
MISC--: co occurrence based methods also used discover new hidden relationships assuming if c both connected b c might also relationship even if there no published relationship between c swanson provided classic example his study he found fish oil intake beneficial patients suffering raynaud s disease finding was confirmed experimentally few years later citation citation
MISC--: hidden literature relationships used confirm hypothesis about relationship between c so called closed discovery process citation citation
OWNX--: this process user provides hypothesis related c then tested mining literature shared biomedical concepts support hypothesis
MISC--: hidden relationships also used generate novel hypotheses about relationship between c so called open discovery process citation citation citation citation
MISC--: this process user provides starting point examines literature hidden relationships other biomedical concepts bridged intermediates share co occurrences c
MISC--: tools currently available performing open discovery experiments often limited certain biomedical domains only limited number keywords describing biomedical terms retrieve hidden relationships formed uninformative concepts vitro microarray biologically less interesting citation citation citation
OWNX--: moreover bottleneck all open discovery tools identify true biologically informative hidden relationships spurious hits
AIMX--: previous paper we described copub citation database co occurrences keywords medline abstracts
MISC--: copub database statistical relevance all co occurrences pre computed makes possible perform statistical analyses significance retrieved hidden relationships between biomedical concepts
MISC--: addition copub contains several categories controlled vocabularies genes drugs diseases etc this database ideally suited use discovery hidden relationships
OWNX--: this paper we describe copub discovery method uses copub database open closed discovery hidden literature relationships
MISC--: statistical analysis results using roc curves show copub discovery true hidden relationships distinguished true negatives
MISC--: application this method open ended retrieval hidden relations yielded novel hypotheses about gene disease drug disease drug biological process relationships were validated bibliographically
OWNX--: moreover we used copub discovery identify two novel compounds would interact cell proliferation
MISC--: experimental validation showed compounds dose dependently inhibited t cell proliferation
