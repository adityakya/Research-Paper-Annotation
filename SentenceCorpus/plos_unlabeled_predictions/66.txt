OWNX--: massive amounts data being generated effort represent brain expression all genes at cellular resolution
MISC--: critical exploiting this effort ability place data into common frame reference
OWNX--: here we developed computational method annotating gene expression patterns context digital atlas facilitate custom user queries comparisons this type data
OWNX--: this procedure been applied genes postnatal mouse brain
AIMX--: illustration utility we identify candidate genes may related parkinson disease using expression dopamine transporter substantia nigra search query pattern
OWNX--: addition we discover transcription factor rorb down regulated barrelless mutant relative control mice quantitative comparison expression patterns layer iv somatosensory cortex
OWNX--: semi automated annotation method developed here applicable broad spectrum complex tissues data modalities
OWNX--: high resolution maps gene expression provide important information about how genes regulate biological processes at cellular molecular levels
MISC--: therefore multitude efforts progress depict gene expression at single cell resolution specimens ranging organs embryos
MISC--: common genome scale projects they generate vast numbers images expression patterns reveal presence transcripts proteins particular cell group cells within natural context
CONT--: however large collections images limited usefulness per se without efficient means mine images characterize compare gene protein expression patterns
MISC--: analogy requirements mining genomic sequence information meaningful retrieval expression patterns requires suitable annotation
OWNX--: annotation we mean associating sites strengths expression digital representation anatomy specimen
MISC--: annotation approach taken gene expression database citation hand curate published gene expression patterns using extensive dictionary anatomical terms
MISC--: this annotation facilitated edinburgh mouse atlas project provides anatomical ontology relationships using hierarchical tree citation
MISC--: visualization achieved associating terms locations volumetric model citation
MISC--: edinburgh mouse atlas project also provides tools map situ hybridization images directly into three dimensional atlas citation
MISC--: although hand curation effective method annotation not efficient means handling large scale datasets systematically collected robotic ish citation
MISC--: addition if future changes made anatomical designations updating annotation may require laborious review previously annotated data
OWNX--: here we present completely novel approach uses geometric modeling technique create digital atlas postnatal day mouse brain
MISC--: this deformable atlas then adjusted match major anatomical structures present p mouse brain tissue sections accurately define boundaries between structures provide smooth multi resolution coordinate representation small structures
MISC--: when combining this technique method detecting strength gene expression one efficiently automatically annotate large number gene expression patterns way subsequently allows queries comparisons expression patterns user defined regions interest
OWNX--: p mouse brain was selected specimen because at this developmental stage many complex brain functions begin established yet existing information underlying molecular mechanisms still relatively limited
OWNX--: we describe here creation prototype gene dataset generated using robotic ish application our deformable atlas based annotation method this dataset
OWNX--: we then demonstrate utility approach two examples searching genes expressed substantia nigra identifying genes potentially involved functional regionalization cortex
