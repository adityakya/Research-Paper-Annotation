AIMX--: we construct model study tradeoffs associated aging adaptive immune system focusing cumulative effects replacing naive cells memory cells
MISC--: binding affinities characterized stochastic shape space model
MISC--: system loss arising individual infection associated disease severity measured total antigen population over course infection
OWNX--: we monitor evolution cell populations shape space over string infections find distribution losses becomes increasingly heavy tailed time
MISC--: initially this lowers average loss memory cell population becomes tuned history past exposures reducing loss system when subjected second similar infection
MISC--: this accompanied corresponding increase vulnerability novel infections ultimately causes expected loss increase due overspecialization leading increasing fragility age
OWNX--: our model immunosenescence not result performance degradation some specific lymphocyte but rather natural consequence built mechanisms system adaptation
MISC--: this robust yet fragile behavior key signature highly optimized tolerance
MISC--: adaptive immune system citation vertebrates evolved manner enables adaptation history infections over lifetime each individual organism
MISC--: consists complex heterogeneous collection cells derived stem cells bone marrow proliferates lymph nodes
MISC--: cells endowed remarkable ability discriminate between self nonself agents within body remove nonself elements citation citation
MISC--: b t cells white blood cells constitute adaptive components immune system
MISC--: they derive their ability discriminate self nonself binding specificity their receptors t cell receptors t cells membrane bound antibody b cells
MISC--: receptors assembled randomly gene segments producing population naive cells each individual combination different binding specificity
MISC--: random combinations genes give immune system ability produce diverse cells capable responding many pathogens
MISC--: during infection cells whose receptors recognize antigen proliferate differentiate into antigen removing effector cells long lived memory cells
MISC--: memory cells give rise more rapid efficient response secondary exposure same antigen
MISC--: however due homeostatic regulation lymphocyte population growth memory cells reduces naive cell population size
MISC--: over time this effect increasing sensitivity novel infections
AIMX--: we introduce model captures this tradeoff between resilience repeated exposure sensitivity new pathogens
MISC--: model consists coupled differential equations immune system cell populations defined terms their primary immunological function their binding characteristics
MISC--: relative population sizes evolve time stimulated episodic infections
MISC--: antigens drawn probability distribution their characteristics enables estimation binding affinity lymphocytes
OWNX--: we include constraint total number immune cells system define immunological loss function quantifies disease severity
MISC--: constraint number cells implies memory specific infections system seen comes at price unseen infections citation
CONT--: our model illustrates how immune system initially increases effectiveness but eventually becomes overspecialized age
