MISC--: topology cellular circuits key understand their robustness both mutations noise
MISC--: reason many biochemical parameters driving circuit behavior vary extensively thus not fine tuned
OWNX--: existing work this area asks what extent function any one given circuit robust
MISC--: but high robustness truly remarkable would expected many circuits similar topology
OWNX--: how high robustness come about through gradual darwinian evolution changes circuit topology gradually one interaction at time
AIMX--: we here ask questions model transcriptional regulation networks we explore millions different network topologies
MISC--: robustness mutations noise correlated networks
MISC--: they show skewed distribution very small number networks being vastly more robust than rest
MISC--: all networks attain given gene expression state organized into graph whose nodes networks differ their topology
MISC--: remarkably this graph connected easily traversed gradual changes network topologies
MISC--: thus robustness evolvable property
MISC--: this connectedness evolvability robust networks may general organizational principle biological networks
MISC--: addition exists also rna protein structures may thus general organizational principle all biological systems
MISC--: biochemical parameters determine behavior cellular systems proteins genome scale regulatory networks change continually
MISC--: change two principal sources
MISC--: one them genetic consists mutations
MISC--: other nongenetic exemplified noise internal organism environmental change
OWNX--: contrast mutations relatively rare internal noise ubiquitous substantial
MISC--: much consists stochastic variation gene expression expression regulation citation citation
OWNX--: noise makes all biochemical parameters affecting circuit s behavior appear fluctuate randomly
MISC--: environmental change change temperature salinity nutrient availability similarly affect many parameters at once
CONT--: observations suggest biological circuits not fine tuned exercise their functions only precise values their biochemical parameters
MISC--: instead they must able function under range different parameters
MISC--: other words they must robust parameter change
MISC--: insights lead explorations circuit robustness processes ranging bacterial chemotaxis embryonic development citation citation
MISC--: quantitative models cellular circuits help us understand processes different circadian rhythms citation citation cell cycle citation organismal development citation citation citation citation citation citation bacterial chemotaxis citation behavior synthetic circuitry citation citation
MISC--: several classes models used represent biological networks
MISC--: first class comprises differential equation models
MISC--: continuous state variables equations correspond concentrations activities gene products
MISC--: interactions gene products represented through biochemical parameters binding affinities transcriptional regulators dna dissociation constants ligand receptor complexes kinetic rate constants enzymes
MISC--: nearly universal problem quantitative information about biochemical parameters absent even experimentally well studied systems
MISC--: other words some knowledge topology circuit who interacts whom may exist but strengths interactions usually unknown
MISC--: even where measurements biochemical parameters available they often order magnitude estimates rather than quantitative measurements known precision
MISC--: this difficulty leads one naturally second class models only qualitative nature state variables considered
MISC--: our focus here not consider any one circuit but many circuit architectures topologies
MISC--: because incessant changes biochemical parameters lack quantitative information about their values approach appropriate studying fundamental properties cellular circuits particular one may ask what features responsible robustness circuit architecture topology citation citation citation citation citation
BASE--: this work we carry out analysis model transcriptional regulation networks important functions developmental processes
MISC--: despite its level abstraction this model proven highly successful explaining regulatory dynamics early developmental genes fruit fly drosophila well predicting mutant phenotypes citation citation citation
MISC--: also helped elucidate why mutants often show release genetic variation cryptic wild type how adaptive evolution robustness occurs genetic networks given topology citation citation
MISC--: most recently helped explain how sexual reproduction enhance robustness recombination citation
MISC--: model citation concerned regulatory network n transcriptional regulators represented their expression patterns s at some time t during developmental cell biological process one cell domain embryo
CONT--: time scale model s expression dynamics time scale characteristic transcriptional regulation order minutes not order days weeks months complete development zygote adult
OWNX--: model s transcriptional regulators influence each other s expression through cross regulatory autoregulatory interactions encapsulated matrix w elements w ij this matrix indicate strength regulatory influence gene j gene i this influence either activating repressing absent
MISC--: put differently matrix w represents genotype this system while expression state its phenotype
AIMX--: we model change expression state s network time t progresses according difference equation where constant sigmoidal function whose values lie interval
OWNX--: this equation reflects regulation gene i s expression other genes
OWNX--: we here concerned networks whose expression dynamics start prespecified initial state s at some time t during development arrive at prespecified stable equilibrium target expression state s we will call networks viable networks
MISC--: initial state determined regulatory factors upstream network may represent signals cell s environment other domains embryo
MISC--: transcriptional regulators expressed stable equilibrium state s affect expression genes downstream network
OWNX--: modeling assumption we think their expression critical course development
MISC--: thus deviations s highly deleterious
BASE--: because our work starts developmental framework s s play central role this contrast most studies determining generic properties random boolean networks citation citation citation citation citation citation
MISC--: we here examine relationship between robustness network topology millions networks different topologies
OWNX--: topology synonymous structure matrix w because each w s nonzero entries corresponds one regulatory interaction among circuit s genes
OWNX--: changes topology correspond loss regulatory interaction appearance new regulatory interaction was previously absent
MISC--: topological changes occur very short evolutionary time scales particular higher eukaryotes large regulatory regions citation
MISC--: this underscores need study their effects network robustness
OWNX--: our analysis we first ask how robustness mutations noise varies within ensemble networks different topologies
OWNX--: subsequently more importantly we also ask whether highly robust topologies evolve topologies low robustness through gradual topological changes
