MISC--: male rocky mountain elk produce loud high fundamental frequency bugles during mating season contrast male european red deer who produces loud low fundamental frequency roaring calls
MISC--: critical step understanding vocal communication relate sound complexity anatomy physiology causal manner
MISC--: experimentation at sound source often difficult vivo mammals simulated here finite element model larynx wave propagation model vocal tract both based morphology biomechanics elk
MISC--: model produce wide range fundamental frequencies
OWNX--: low fundamental frequencies require low vocal fold strain but large lung pressure large glottal flow if sound intensity level exceed db at m distance
OWNX--: high frequency bugle requires both large muscular effort high lung pressure but at least db more intensity level achieved
OWNX--: glottal efficiency ration radiated sound power aerodynamic power at glottis higher elk suggesting advantage high pitched signaling
OWNX--: this advantage based two aspects first lower airflow required aerodynamic power second acoustic radiation advantage at higher frequencies
OWNX--: both signal types used respective males during mating season probably serve honest signals
MISC--: two signal types relate differently physical qualities sender
MISC--: low frequency sound relates overall body size via strong relationship between acoustic parameters size vocal organs body size
OWNX--: high frequency bugle may signal muscular strength endurance via vocalizing at edge mechanism efficiency critical
MISC--: contrary expectation based body size some large male mammals use high pitched vocalization display
OWNX--: dichotomy between low frequency high frequency calls vocal signaling male characteristics rarely so dramatic two closely related cervid species european red deer rocky mountain elk
MISC--: during mating season one species recognizable low frequency roar while other well known its high frequency bugle citation citation
MISC--: acoustic signals vocal communication mammals generally very complex because various selective pressures shape them citation
MISC--: complexity related natural sexual selection
MISC--: example signal considered honest if reliable information about sender extracted body size physical strength
MISC--: animal s body size physical strength important implications its physiology ecology fecundity its aggressive interactions mating success citation
MISC--: male red deer mating call was selected low vocal tract resonance characteristics provide reliable information about body size due interconnected size dependent factors involved sound production citation
OWNX--: contrast difficult make case body size signaled high fundamental frequency whistle like bugle elk
MISC--: elk calls sometimes contain low frequency components but not consistently
MISC--: signature bugle
MISC--: what provoked evolution calls would generally associated much smaller animals
OWNX--: here we investigate physiological tradeoffs related production high low frequency sounds
BASE--: we simulated red deer elk calls finite element model oscillating vocal folds positioned within laryngeal cartilaginous framework applying intrinsic laryngeal muscle activations citation wave propagation model vocal tract citation goal better understand physiology this intriguing system
MISC--: larynx finite element model was based anatomy biomechanics rocky mountain elk red deer larynges citation citation
