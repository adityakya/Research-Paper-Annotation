MISC--: many important protein protein interactions mediated binding short peptide stretch one protein large globular segment another
AIMX--: recent efforts provided hundreds examples new peptides binding proteins three dimensional structure available but where no structure protein peptide complex known
AIMX--: address this gap we present approach accurately predict peptide binding sites protein surfaces
OWNX--: peptides known bind particular protein method predicts binding sites great accuracy specificity approach means also used predict whether not putative predicted peptide partner will bind
OWNX--: we used known protein peptide complexes derive preferences form spatial position specific scoring matrices describe binding site environment globular proteins each type amino acid bound peptides
OWNX--: we then scan surface putative binding protein sites each amino acids present peptide partner search combinations high scoring amino acid sites satisfy constraints deduced peptide sequence
MISC--: method performed well benchmark largely agreed experimental data mapping binding sites several recently discovered interactions mediated peptides including rg rich proteins smn domains epstein barr virus lmp tradd domains dbc sir ago hook argonaute piwi domain
OWNX--: method associated statistics excellent tool predicting studying binding sites newly discovered peptides mediating critical events biology
MISC--: protein protein interactions vital all cellular processes including signaling dna repair trafficking replication gene expression metabolism
MISC--: interactions vary substantially how they mediated
MISC--: what perhaps most often comes mind interactions involving large interfaces those inside hemoglobin tetramer however many important protein interactions particularly those transient low affinity related post translational modification events like phosphorylation mediated binding globular domain one protein short peptide stretch another citation
MISC--: stretches often reside non globular disordered parts proteome including many disordered interaction hubs citation citation thus helping explain many emerging functional roles regions
MISC--: peptide regions binding common protein domain often conform sequence pattern linear motif captures key features binding citation
MISC--: instance sh domains bind pxxp motifs ww domains bind ppxy pplp motifs sh ptb domains bind phosphorylated peptides citation
MISC--: since they generally held more chemically tractable than interactions involving larger interfaces protein peptide interactions also represent important new class drug targets there growing number small molecules designed target them citation
MISC--: discovery new peptides motifs mediating interactions been intense interest recent years
MISC--: several techniques been developed uncover new variants peptides bind known partners
MISC--: instance phage display peptide array technologies been applied uncover new peptide partners many proteins domains including sh citation ww citation pdz citation domains
MISC--: several computational approaches also been developed use protein peptide complexes known d structure find additional peptides likely bind recently probabilistic interaction networks been used predict peptide regions corresponding kinase substrate citation
MISC--: common thread all approaches they rely prior knowledge type peptide binding domain often require further knowledge peptide binding site globular protein
MISC--: they thus generally only effective finding new variants known peptides cannot directly uncover new protein peptide interaction types
CONT--: protein protein docking currently only widely used technique applied this problem generally however this approach limited application peptides longer than residues largely owing high degree flexibility one must consider when docking typical peptide residues need known peptide conformation only rarely available citation
MISC--: moreover docking methods very sensitive conformational changes require very high resolution structures perform well
MISC--: determining new protein peptide interaction types problematic experimentally mostly because difficult advance know regions larger proteins responsible binding necessitating painstaking experiments deletion mutagenesis coupled binding assays
MISC--: address this several computational methods been developed discover new protein peptide motif pairs using principle sequence over representation proteins common interacting partner citation citation
MISC--: methods together much conventional work focused understanding interactions identified predicted hundreds new peptide motifs mediating interactions particular protein domain families
MISC--: however discoveries rarely provide information about where peptide binds protein
OWNX--: knowing details suggest further experiments help ultimately design chemical modulators interaction
MISC--: structures protein peptide complexes all newly discovered interactions will require substantial time become available though rapid increase structural data single proteins means very often d structures available at least part protein isolation
MISC--: there thus widening gap between proteins known structure known predicted bind particular peptide available d complexes would foster deeper understanding mechanism afford discovery additional peptides
AIMX--: here we present method attempts bridge this gap predicting binding site peptides protein surfaces
MISC--: we used dataset protein peptide complexes known d structure extracted protein data bank citation define spatial position specific scoring matrices capturing preferences how each amino acid binds protein surfaces
MISC--: three dimensional position specific scoring matrices been used past predict protein folding citation assess quality structural models citation predict function proteins based matches position specific scoring matrices new protein structure citation identify protein surface similarities citation
OWNX--: however best our knowledge they not been used predict interactions this way
OWNX--: new protein peptide pair we identify candidate peptide binding sites linking predicted sites each residue protein surface according peptide deduced distance constraints
OWNX--: we developed statistics determine confidence prediction estimate whether not putative peptide binds
