OWNX--: advances time lapse fluorescence microscopy enabled us directly observe dynamic cellular phenomena
MISC--: although techniques themselves promoted understanding dynamic cellular functions vast number images acquired generated need automated processing tools extract statistical information

OWNX--: applying eet fluorescence resonance energy transfer images rho family gtpases rac cdc rhoa we examined cross correlation between local area difference gtpase activity
MISC--: calculated correlations changed time shifts expected but surprisingly peak correlation coefficients appeared min time shift morphological changes preceded rac cdc activities
OWNX--: our method enables quantification dynamics local morphological change local protein activity statistical investigation relationship between them considering time shifts relationship

MISC--: although previous methodologies successfully described specific aspects cellular morphodynamics there remain challenges quantify relationship between morphodynamics signaling events
MISC--: one representative problem association between regions different frames
OWNX--: scrutinize dynamic relationship between morphological change molecular signaling we need cross correlate them time dependent manner
MISC--: polar coordinate system does not ensure association time shifted local domains unsuitable non circular cell shapes
MISC--: virtual marker tracking method satisfies this requirement cells broadly consistent shapes but its fixed number markers causes unequal distribution when dramatic shape change persistent growth neurites neurons occurs
OWNX--: taking problems into account we perceive need novel quantification method better understand mechanisms morphodynamic regulation molecular signaling

MISC--: objective this study was uncover relationship between spatio temporal activities rho gtpases morphological changes cells
OWNX--: achieve this we needed data analysis tool assess link between biochemical signaling biophysical phenomena
OWNX--: however we do not focus unveiling orchestration complete signaling pathways regulate cell morphology
OWNX--: addition we elucidated how rho gtpases regulate two dimensional morphological changes cells rather than three dimensional changes
OWNX--: findings will however meaningful because results compared earlier findings citation citation
OWNX--: therefore we first present algorithm called edge evolution tracking quantify local morphological change
