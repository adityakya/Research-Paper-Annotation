MISC--: transcriptional regulators recognize specific dna sequences
OWNX--: because sequences embedded background genomic dna hard identify key cis regulatory elements determine disparate patterns gene expression
OWNX--: detection intra inter species differences among sequences crucial understanding molecular basis both differential gene expression evolution
AIMX--: here we address this problem investigating target promoters controlled dna binding phop protein governs virulence mg homeostasis several bacterial species
MISC--: phop particularly interesting highly conserved different gamma enterobacteria regulating not only ancestral genes but also governing expression dozens horizontally acquired genes differ species species
OWNX--: our approach consists decomposing dna binding site sequences given regulator into families motifs using machine learning method inspired divide conquer strategy
MISC--: partitioning motif into sub patterns computational advantages classification were produced resulting discovery new members regulon alleviating problem distinguishing functional sites chromatin immunoprecipitation dna microarray genome wide analysis
OWNX--: moreover we found certain partitions were useful revealing biological properties binding site sequences including modular gains losses phop binding sites through evolutionary turnover events well conservation distant species
OWNX--: high conservation phop submotifs within gamma enterobacteria well regulatory protein recognizes them suggests major cause divergence between related species not due binding sites was previously suggested other regulators
OWNX--: instead divergence may attributed fast evolution orthologous target genes promoter architectures resulting interaction those binding sites rna polymerase
OWNX--: whole genome sequences well microarray chromatin inmunoprecipitation array hybridization data provide raw material characterization understanding underlying regulatory systems
MISC--: still challenging however discern sequence elements relevant differential gene expression those corresponding binding sites transcriptional factors rna polymerase when they embedded background genomic dna sequences do not play role gene expression citation
MISC--: this raises question how does single regulator distinguish promoter sequences when affinity major determinant differential expression
MISC--: also how does regulator evolve given there appears non monotonic co evolution regulators targets citation citation
MISC--: methods look matching consensus pattern been successfully used identify bss promoters controlled particular tfs citation citation
MISC--: tools motif discovery designed find unknown relatively short sequence patterns located primarily promoter regions genomes citation
MISC--: because searches performed context short signals embedded high statistical noise current tools tend discard relevant number samples only weakly resemble consensus citation
MISC--: moreover strict cutoffs used methods while increasing specificity display lower sensitivity citation citation weak but still functional bss
MISC--: because consensus motif reflects single pattern derived averaging dna sequences often conceals sub patterns might define distinct regulatory mechanisms citation
MISC--: overall use consensuses tends homogenize sequence motifs among promoters even across species citation citation hampers discovery key features distinguish co regulated promoters within across species
MISC--: circumvent limitations consensus methods citation we decomposed bs motifs into sub patterns citation citation applying classical divide conquer strategy citation citation
OWNX--: we then compared different forms decomposed bs motifs tf into families motifs computational clustering perspective
MISC--: so doing we extracted maximal amount useful genomic information through effective handling biological experimental variability inherent data then combined them into accurate multi classifier predictor citation citation
MISC--: although there computational usefulness submotifs citation citation was not clear if families motifs were just computational artifact if they could provide insights into regulatory process carried out regulator its targets
OWNX--: address this problem we evaluated ability submotifs characterize gene expression both within across genomes
OWNX--: first we used submotifs distinguish between functional non functional bss genome wide searches using combination chip chip custom expression microarray experiments
MISC--: then we determined evolutionary significance submotifs calculating their rate evolution citation citation mapping gain loss events along phylogenetic tree gamma enterobacteria
MISC--: interspecies variation orthologous genes conservation regulatory protein well cis features conforming promoter architecture allowed us evaluate major causes divergences between species citation citation
OWNX--: we applied our approach analyze genes regulated phop phoq two component system mediates adaptation low mg environments virulence several bacteria species including escherichia coli species salmonella species shigella species erwinia species photorhabdus yersinia species
MISC--: two component systems represent primary signal transduction paradigm prokaryotic organisms
MISC--: although proteins encoded systems often well conserved throughout different bacterial species citation citation regulators like phop differentially control expression many horizontally acquired genes constitute one major sources genomic variation citation
