MISC--: duplications genes encoding highly connected essential proteins selected against several species but not human where duplicated genes encode highly connected proteins
MISC--: understand when how gene duplicability changed evolution we compare gene network properties four species representative increase evolutionary complexity defined progressive growth number genes cells cell types
MISC--: we find origin conservation gene significantly correlates properties encoded protein protein protein interaction network
OWNX--: all four species preserve core singleton central hubs originated early evolution highly conserved accomplish basic biological functions
MISC--: another group hubs appeared metazoans duplicated vertebrates mostly through vertebrate specific whole genome duplication
OWNX--: recent duplicated hubs frequently targets micrornas show tissue selective expression suggesting alternative mechanisms control their dosage
MISC--: our study shows how networks modified during evolution contributes explaining occurrence somatic genetic diseases cancer terms network perturbations
OWNX--: gene duplicability defines propensity retain multiple copies gene varies among species gene categories
MISC--: yeast singleton genes i e single copy genes whose duplication selected against preferentially encode members protein complexes citation highly connected citation citation essential citation citation proteins
MISC--: similar relationships maintained also multicellular species worm fly where singleton genes encode highly connected citation essential citation proteins
MISC--: strict retention one single copy particular gene categories consequence fragility towards dosage modifications
MISC--: their duplication deleterious because interferes essential cellular functions fine tuned equilibrium between formation disruption protein protein interactions citation citation
MISC--: recent studies showed duplicability mammalian hubs essential proteins different other species
MISC--: human hubs citation citation mouse essential proteins involved development citation citation citation preferentially encoded duplicated genes while other categories essential mouse genes both singletons duplicated citation
MISC--: differences between human mouse other species suggest gene duplicability underwent modifications during evolution likely related extensive acquisition novel genes vertebrates
MISC--: through massive gene duplication followed diversification paralogs vertebrates accommodated expansion gene families involved regulation signal transduction protein transport protein modification citation citation
OWNX--: this context been proposed higher connectivity may favor functional diversification paralogs example through tissue specialization citation
MISC--: however thorough analysis types genes undergo modification their duplicability during evolution how this influences network properties encoded proteins still missing
MISC--: comparison gene network properties between species most straightforward approach verify whether modification gene duplicability indeed related expansion vertebrate gene repertoire
MISC--: despite fact current representations protein interactomes still incomplete citation citation citation may include high fraction false positives citation recent completion interaction screenings several species finally allows comparative network analyses
MISC--: example comparison human fly worm yeast networks showed they maintain similar structure despite difference size citation citation
MISC--: addition regardless their connectivity proteins occupy central positions interactomes saccharomyces cerevisiae drosophila melanogaster caenorhabditis elegans also essential slow evolving citation
MISC--: studies demonstrate comparison protein gene properties different species used infer general evolutionary trends
MISC--: unravel when differences between duplicability network properties arose during evolution we undertake comparative analysis genes networks four species escherichia coli yeast fly human
MISC--: species display different levels complexity defined number genes cells cell types citation also high quality genomic interaction data
OWNX--: we compare connectivity centrality all proteins origin conservation duplicability corresponding genes
OWNX--: we identify core singleton hubs whose properties maintained constant prokaryotes human another group duplicated hubs emerged during evolution vertebrates
MISC--: our analysis provides evidence how hubs properties modified during evolution helps interpreting occurrence somatic genetic diseases typical multicellularity cancer terms network perturbations
OWNX--: particular we find cancer genes representatives two groups human hubs one originated early evolution composed singleton genes other appeared later enriched duplicated genes
MISC--: functionally two groups correspond caretakers gatekeepers suggesting two different ways initiate tumorigenesis emerged at different times during evolution
