MISC--: previous model based analysis metabolic network geobacter sulfurreducens suggested existence several redundant pathways
OWNX--: here we identified eight sets redundant pathways included redundancy assimilation acetate conversion pyruvate into acetyl coa
OWNX--: equivalent pathways two other sub optimal pathways were studied using single gene deletion mutants those pathways evaluation predictive capacity model
OWNX--: growth phenotypes mutants were studied under different conditions electron donor acceptor availability
MISC--: comparison model predictions resulting experimental phenotypes indicated pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase only activity able convert pyruvate into acetyl coa
CONT--: however results modeling showed two acetate activation pathways present not only active but needed due additional role acetyl coa transferase tca cycle probably reflecting adaptation bacteria acetate utilization
OWNX--: other cases data reconciliation suggested additional capacity constraints were confirmed biochemical assays
MISC--: results demonstrate need experimentally verify activity key enzymes when developing silico models microbial physiology based sequence based reconstruction metabolic networks
MISC--: geobacter species interest because their natural role carbon mineral cycling their ability remediate organic metal contaminants subsurface their capacity harvest electricity waste organic matter citation citation
MISC--: geobacter sulfurreducens citation most commonly investigated species this genus because genetic system citation complete genome sequence citation whole genome microarrays citation genome scale proteomics citation available
MISC--: furthermore functional genomics studies provided insight into mechanisms extracellular electron transport onto important electron acceptors fe oxides electrodes citation citation
MISC--: g
MISC--: sulfurreducens use either acetate hydrogen sole electron donors fe reduction fumarate malate also used terminal electron acceptors citation
MISC--: understanding acetate metabolism geobacter species required because acetate secreted fermenting organisms dominant electron donor geobacteraceae soils sediments citation because recent studies shown addition acetate uranium contaminated aquifers stimulate situ bioremediation uranium contamination geobacter species citation citation
MISC--: previous studies demonstrated geobacter species closely related desulfuromonas acetoxidans oxidize acetate via tca cycle citation citation
MISC--: however many other aspects acetate metabolism central metabolism general still poorly understood
MISC--: better understand physiology g sulfurreducens constraint based genome scale metabolic model was constructed used investigate unique physiology associated reduction extracellular electron acceptors fe citation
OWNX--: genome scale model enabled assessment impact global proton balance during fe reduction biomass energy yields successfully predicted lower biomass yields observed during growth mutant fumarate reductase had been deleted citation
MISC--: furthermore network reconstruction revealed existence number redundant alternate pathways central metabolism g sulfurreducens citation
MISC--: recent genetic silico studies shown presence redundant metabolic pathways well isozymes enable metabolic networks withstand genetic perturbations citation citation
OWNX--: experimental evidence alternate optimal pathways been observed e coli where four metabolic gene deletion mutants had significantly different metabolic flux distributions but similar overall growth rates citation
MISC--: hence systematic investigation role redundant pathways using silico models provide key insights into properties metabolic networks
OWNX--: here we report coupled computational experimental evaluation potential redundant pathways during acetate metabolism g sulfurreducens
OWNX--: we demonstrate need redundancy acetate assimilation pathways due coupling between tca cycle acetate activation acetyl coa also inactivity some predicted alternatives pyruvate oxidation acetyl coa
OWNX--: we also show using this information constrain model its predictive capacity improved
