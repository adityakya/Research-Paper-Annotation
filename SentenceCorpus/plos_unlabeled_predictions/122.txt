MISC--: become clear large proportion functional dna human genome does not code protein
CONT--: identification this non coding functional sequence using comparative approaches proving difficult previously been thought require deep sequencing multiple vertebrates
AIMX--: here we introduce new model comparative method instead nucleotide substitutions uses evolutionary imprint insertions deletions infer past consequences selection
MISC--: model predicts distribution indels under neutrality shows excellent fit human mouse ancestral repeat data
OWNX--: across genome many unusually long ungapped regions detected unaccounted neutral model we predict highly enriched functional dna been subject purifying selection respect indels
OWNX--: we use model determine proportion under indel purifying selection between percent percent human euchromatin
MISC--: since annotated protein coding genes comprise only percent euchromatin results lend further weight proposition more than half functional complement human genome non protein coding
OWNX--: method surprisingly powerful at identifying selected sequence using only two three mammalian genomes
OWNX--: applying method human mouse dog genomes we identify mb human sequence under indel purifying selection at predicted percent false discovery rate percent sensitivity
OWNX--: expected most identified sequence represents unannotated material while recovered proportions known protein coding microrna genes closely match predicted sensitivity method
OWNX--: method s high sensitivity functional sequence micrornas suggest yet unannotated microrna genes enriched among sequences identified
MISC--: futhermore its independence substitutions allowed us identify sequence been subject heterogeneous selection sequence subject both positive selection respect substitutions purifying selection respect indels
OWNX--: ability identify elements under heterogeneous selection enables first time genome wide investigation positive selection functional elements other than protein coding genes
MISC--: human genome been shaped evolutionary forces mutation genetic drift selection latter acting main purify functional regions deleterious mutations
MISC--: comparing human mouse genomes previously was estimated about percent human genome undergone fewer point mutations than expected under neutral substitution model citation citation
MISC--: accepting this most likely caused effects purifying selection acting deleterious mutations observation implies at least percent human genome biologically functional
CONT--: since only known large class functional genomic elements protein coding exons believed constitute only percent our genome citation this remains surprising result
MISC--: begin understand biological role remaining non genic functional elements essential first step their identification
MISC--: recent studies focussed most highly conserved elements namely ultraconserved elements citation
MISC--: elements exhibit surprisingly high level conservation rare even among protein coding exons studies begun suggest intriguing roles elements alternative splicing development citation citation
CONT--: however vast majority non genic elements not perfectly conserved respect point mutations reliable identification elements within sea neutrally evolving dna proved difficult
MISC--: deep conservation among diverse phyla reliable sign conserved biological function but less suitable identifying recently evolved sequence
MISC--: comparative methods closely related species typically analyze substitution patterns flag conserved regions citation
MISC--: methods well developed they exploit phylogenetic information correlations along sequence achieve high sensitivities
MISC--: although extremely powerful methods hard calibrate because incompletely understood variations neutral rates substitution due instance methylation levels chromatin state transcriptional activity chromosomal location conservative calibration leads reduction sensitivity
MISC--: deep sequencing mammalian genomes considerably improves power comparative methods citation while expensive this will eventually represent most satisfying solution sensitivity problem
MISC--: all mutation processes point substitutions most prevalent insertions deletions approximately fold less frequent
MISC--: while nucleotide substitution models been studied intensively citation citation exception gene finding citation indels largely been treated evolutionary nuisance events accounted alignment procedures but otherwise uninformative
OWNX--: contrary this view we show indels highly informative evolutionary events
AIMX--: we introduce model describing neutral distribution indels over genome show this model fits large proportion human mouse alignment data remarkably well
OWNX--: we then show deviations model main not caused variations neutral indel rates but consistent selection acting purify genome deleterious indels arise functional regions
OWNX--: we first applied this neutral indel model derive upper lower bounds proportion genome under purifying selection respect indels
MISC--: our observations explained proposing between mb mb human genome been under indel purifying selection since human mouse split
MISC--: although still much higher than percent represented coding exons this represents substantially lower estimate than previous percent estimate based substitution level conservation citation citation but consistent more recent estimate citation
OWNX--: restricting ourselves ancestral repeats transposable elements inserted before human mouse split we found near exact fit between observations neutral model predictions
OWNX--: applying same method before we predict among mb tes only at most mb been under sustained purifying selection
OWNX--: this first time our knowledge model neutral evolution quantified proportion tes evolved neutrally
OWNX--: second application neutral indel model we identified large proportion sequence elements evolved under indel purifying selection
MISC--: model allowed us calculate predicted false discovery rate entire set well bayesian posterior probabilities individual elements under indel purifying selection
OWNX--: correlating this set various independent functional indicators both positive negative shown highly enriched functional dna
OWNX--: key strength proposed method lies its independence selection respect point mutations
OWNX--: consequently method provide independent confirmation selection thereby improving specificity methods based substitutions alone
MISC--: moreover exciting possibility method allows identification sequence elements been under heterogeneous selection i e been subject purifying selection respect indels but subject positive selection relaxed constraints respect substitutions
MISC--: examples elements would include spacers between regulatory elements whose relative distance functionally constrained those shown exist drosophila citation
MISC--: although functional nucleotide sequence spacers probably immaterial implying relaxed constraints respect substitutions
MISC--: even more interesting class consists elements whose sequence under positive selection respect substitutions while at same time under purifying selection respect indels
OWNX--: since indels highly disruptive function protein coding rna genes evident fold reduced indel rates exons compared neutrally evolving dna conceivable elements exist
MISC--: without exploiting evolutionary imprint indel purifying selection difficult see how identify functional elements under positive selection respect substitutions absence comprehensive functional annotation only exists currently protein coding genes
MISC--: analysis percent sequence identity suggested much percent dna under indel purifying selection roughly mb may under heterogeneous selection
MISC--: among indel conserved elements identified those exhibit more than expected number substitutions neutrally evolving dna still showed correlations functional indicators mentioned above thereby further confirming existence elements under heterogeneous selection
