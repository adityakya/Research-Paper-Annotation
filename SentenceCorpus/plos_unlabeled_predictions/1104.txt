OWNX--: simultaneous spike counts neural populations typically modeled gaussian distribution
CONT--: short time scales however this distribution too restrictive describe analyze multivariate distributions discrete spike counts
OWNX--: we present alternative based copulas account arbitrary marginal distributions including poisson negative binomial distributions well second higher order interactions
OWNX--: we describe maximum likelihood based procedures fitting copula based models spike count data we derive so called flashlight transformation makes possible move tail dependence arbitrary copula into arbitrary orthant multivariate probability distribution
MISC--: mixtures copulas combine different dependence structures thereby model different driving processes simultaneously also introduced
OWNX--: first we apply copula based models populations integrate fire neurons receiving partially correlated input show best fitting copulas provide information about functional connectivity coupled neurons extracted using flashlight transformation
OWNX--: we then apply new method data were recorded macaque prefrontal cortex using multi tetrode array
OWNX--: we find copula based distributions negative binomial marginals provide appropriate stochastic model multivariate spike count distributions rather than multivariate poisson latent variables distribution often used multivariate normal distribution
OWNX--: dependence structure distributions provides evidence common inhibitory input all recorded stimulus encoding neurons
OWNX--: finally we show copula based models successfully used evaluate neural codes e g characterize stimulus dependent spike count distributions information measures
MISC--: this demonstrates copula based models not only versatile class models multivariate distributions spike counts but those models exploited understand functional dependencies
OWNX--: so far still unknown statistics crucial analysis order understand neural code
OWNX--: one approach analyze simultaneous spike counts neural populations
MISC--: responses populations sensory neurons vary even when same stimulus presented repeatedly variations between simultaneous spike counts usually correlated at least neighboring neurons
MISC--: noise correlations been subject substantial number studies
CONT--: computational reasons however studies typically assume gaussian noise
OWNX--: thus correlated spike rates generally modeled multivariate normal distributions specific covariance matrix describes all pairwise linear correlations
MISC--: long time intervals high firing rates average number spikes sufficiently large central limit theorem apply normal distribution good approximation spike count distributions
CONT--: several experimental findings however suggest processing sensory information take place shorter time scales involving only tens hundreds milliseconds citation citation
OWNX--: this regime normal distribution no longer valid approximation
MISC--: its marginals continuous symmetric shape whereas empirical distributions real spike counts tend positive skew
MISC--: normal distribution heuristically modified order avoid positive probabilities negative values not meaningful spike counts
OWNX--: this major issue low rates probability negative values would high
MISC--: dependence structure multivariate normal distribution always elliptical whereas spike count data often show so called tail dependence probability mass concentrated one corners
MISC--: multivariate normal distribution assumes second order correlations only
MISC--: although was shown pairwise interactions sufficient describing spike count distributions retinal ganglion cells cortex cells vitro citation there evidence significant higher order interactions spike counts recorded cortical areas vivo citation
CONT--: though not widespread modeling spike counts alternative models been proposed previous studies poisson distributed marginals separate parameters higher order correlations e g multiple interaction process model citation compound poisson model citation
MISC--: both models point processes
MISC--: terms their induced spike count distributions models special cases multivariate poisson latent variables distribution first introduced kawamura citation presented compact matrix notation karlis meligkotsidou citation
OWNX--: similar multivariate normal distribution this model also couple shortcomings spike count modeling only poisson marginals modeled
MISC--: negative correlations cannot represented
MISC--: dependence structure inflexible features like tail dependence cannot modeled
MISC--: we use extend versatile class models multivariate discrete distributions overcome shortcomings afore mentioned models citation citation
MISC--: models based concept copulas citation allow combine arbitrary marginal distributions using rich set dependence structures
MISC--: neuroscience they were also applied model distribution continuous first spike latencies citation
OWNX--: figure illustrates copula concept using spike count data two real neurons
MISC--: figure shows bivariate empirical distribution its two marginals
MISC--: distribution counts depends length time bin used count spikes here formula
OWNX--: case considered correlation at low counts higher than at high counts
MISC--: this called lower tail dependence citation
MISC--: figure b shows discretized rectified multivariate normal distribution
