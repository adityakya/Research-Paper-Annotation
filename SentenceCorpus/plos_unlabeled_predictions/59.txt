MISC--: cellular signaling networks subject transcriptional proteolytic regulation under both physiological pathological conditions
MISC--: example expression proteins subject covalent modification phosphorylation known altered upon cellular differentiation during carcinogenesis
MISC--: however unclear how moderate alterations protein expression bring about large changes signal transmission example observed case haploinsufficiency where halving expression signaling proteins abrogates cellular function
OWNX--: modeling fundamental motif signal transduction phosphorylation dephosphorylation cycle we show minor alterations concentration protein subject phosphorylation affect signal transmission highly ultrasensitive fashion
MISC--: this ultrasensitization strongly favored substrate sequestration catalyzing enzymes observed experimentally measured enzymatic rate constants
OWNX--: furthermore we show coordinated transcription multiple proteins within protein kinase cascade results even more pronounced all none behavior respect signal transmission
OWNX--: finally we demonstrate ultrasensitization account specificity modularity regulation cellular signal transduction
OWNX--: ultrasensitization result all none cell fate decisions highly specific cellular regulation
MISC--: additionally switch like phenomena ultrasensitization known contribute bistability oscillations noise reduction cellular heterogeneity
OWNX--: cellular signal transduction exhibits two layers regulation upstream stimuli extracellular peptide hormones activate intracellular signaling intermediates turn induce intracellular responses indicated figure
AIMX--: this type regulation usually operates time scale minutes will termed fast regulation this paper
MISC--: fast regulation involves posttranslational modification pre existing protein pools order transduce signals nucleus
MISC--: responses induced fast regulation activated transcription factors often turn alter total abundance their own activators intermediates heterologous cascades e g owing induced mrna protein synthesis degradation
MISC--: example signal transduction pathways immune system alter concentration their own constituents transcriptional positive negative feedback bring about sensitization citation desensitization citation

MISC--: furthermore deregulated expression wild type phosphoproteins been shown correlated diseases diabetes citation cancer citation
MISC--: at first glance one may expect altered expression intermediate affects steady state signal transmission via intermediate linear fashion
OWNX--: however recent research suggests strong nonlinearity observed at least some cases variety tumor suppressor genes involved cellular signal transduction do not follow knudson s two hit hypothesis i e they do not require homozygotic loss both alleles support tumor progression
MISC--: instead loss single copy i e halving protein expression sufficient abrogate tumor suppressor function this phenomenon been termed haploinsufficiency citation citation
MISC--: this suggests expression signaling proteins affects signal transmission highly switch like fashion
