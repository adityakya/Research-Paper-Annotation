OWNX--: cell polarity general cellular process seen various cell types migrating neutrophils dictyostelium cells
MISC--: rho small gtpases been shown regulate cell polarity however its mechanism emergence yet clarified
OWNX--: we first developed reaction diffusion model rho gtpases exhibits switch like reversible response gradient extracellular signals exclusive accumulation cdc rac rhoa at maximal minimal intensity signal respectively tracking changes signal gradient polarized peak

MISC--: this process known chemotaxis fundamental cellular process citation citation citation
MISC--: migrating cell specific molecular events take place at front back edges citation citation citation citation
MISC--: spatially distinctive molecular accumulation inside cells known cell polarity
MISC--: front back polarity usually one axis this uniqueness important property because migrating cell two fronts could not move effectively citation
MISC--: another behavior front back polarity higher sensitivity front gradient extracellular signals citation citation
OWNX--: this would also important because direction movement should controlled at front edge
