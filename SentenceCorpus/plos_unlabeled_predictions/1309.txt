OWNX--: t cell antigen receptor repertoire generated through rearrangements v j genes encoding chains
MISC--: quantification frequency every v j combination during ontogeny development immune system remain precisely established
OWNX--: we addressed this issue building model able account v j gene rearrangements during thymus development mice
OWNX--: so we developed numerical model whole tra trd locus based experimental data estimate how v j genes become accessible rearrangements
MISC--: progressive opening locus v j gene recombinations modeled through windows accessibility different sizes different speeds progression
OWNX--: furthermore possibility successive secondary v j rearrangements was included modelling
OWNX--: model points out some unbalanced v j associations resulting preferential access gene rearrangements non uniform partition accessibility j genes depending their location locus
OWNX--: model shows successive rearrangements sufficient explain use all v j genes locus
MISC--: finally model provides information both kinetics rearrangements frequencies each v j associations
OWNX--: model accounts essential features observed rearrangements tra trd locus may provide reference repertoire v j combinatorial diversity
MISC--: functional antigen receptors expressed t lymphocytes generated during ontogeny somatic recombination gene segments coding variable joining constant segments citation
MISC--: recombination mechanism largely dependent both accessibility loci rag enzymatic complex citation citation
MISC--: murine tra trd locus composite encoding tr chains encompassed more than functional v genes citation
OWNX--: theory each v genes may target one functional j genes
CONT--: use v j genes during process recombination been widely debated studies support consensus v j combinations not random use j segments starting at end proceeding end citation citation
MISC--: accessibility j region controlled tr enhancer located at end c gene citation two promoters t early located at end j region ii j located kb downstream tea
MISC--: both promoters activated e citation citation citation
OWNX--: e controls all v j associations whereas two promoters required rearrangements j genes situated at end j region
MISC--: however analyses tea deleted alleles those blockade tea transcription showed significant alterations j use support hypothesis tea promoter regulate both positively promoters located first kb j genes negatively downstream promoters citation citation citation
MISC--: particularity tra locus absence allelic exclusion citation its ability undergo multiple cycles secondary rearrangements citation citation
MISC--: process successive rearrangements stopped either positive selection downregulates recombinase expression citation cell death
MISC--: therefore impact secondary rearrangements tr gene assembly regulation remains defined
MISC--: regarding v j gene use suggested first v j association targets secondary one into set j segments located near j segment involved primary rearrangement citation citation
CONT--: rules governing use v genes not been clearly elucidated
MISC--: nevertheless observations converge consensus use v segments would progress proximal v genes located near j region towards v genes located distal region citation citation
MISC--: at this point time mechanism involved control accessibility v genes remains debate citation
MISC--: current state technology permits analysis some v j combinations essentially those at extremities locus but still fails establish complete estimation v j combinations
MISC--: main obstacle comes fact some v genes duplicated similar copies v region central part making problematic their unambiguous identification molecular methods citation
MISC--: consequently numerical modelling v j recombination process may offer valuable support overcome difficulty accessing global view tra repertoire
MISC--: instance if j genes chosen sequential way model their use results unimodal whereas known experimental data tra trd locus displays two hot spots recombination citation citation
MISC--: this discrepancy led us build mathematical model parameterized experimental data all v j genes including those distal proximal central positions
OWNX--: confrontation between data obtained experiments modelling makes possible estimation dynamical parameters accessibility rearrangements frequencies v j associations giving more accurate estimation tra combinatorial diversity
