MISC--: animals rudimentary innate abilities require substantial learning transform those abilities into useful skills where skill considered set sensory motor associations
MISC--: using linear neural network models proved if skills stored distributed representations then within lifetime learning part skill induce automatic learning remaining parts skill
MISC--: more importantly shown this free lunch learning responsible accelerated evolution skills when compared networks either cannot benefit fll cannot learn
MISC--: specifically shown fll accelerates appearance adaptive behaviour both its innate form fll induced behaviour fll accelerate rate at learned behaviours become innate
MISC--: both evolution learning may considered different types adaptation
MISC--: learning occurs within lifetime whereas genetic change occurs across lifetimes citation
MISC--: whereas genetic change ensures task executed innately learning permits even most rudimentary innate ability honed into useful skill
MISC--: environment fluctuates generation generation learning permits innate ability adapted particular physical environment into each generation born
MISC--: if environment ceases fluctuate then genetic assimilation citation transform rudimentary innate ability requires much learning into innate skill requires minimal learning
MISC--: this transformation more likely occur if cost learning high citation citation this case computer simulations suggest learning accelerate rate genetic assimilation citation via baldwin effect citation
MISC--: however if learning sufficiently inexpensive then genetic change may not occur at all citation citation
MISC--: overall there appears tradeoff between learning genetic assimilation learning subsidize genetic change especially if learning inexpensive
MISC--: all but most primitive organisms learn order survive organisms learn quickly at selective advantage relative those learn slowly
MISC--: therefore mechanism reduces time required learn given behaviour confers selective advantage
MISC--: one candidate mechanism fll citation citation
MISC--: explained below fll ensures process learning one set associations behaviours another set associations usually learned
MISC--: associations could comprise either perceptual skills motor skills
MISC--: before considering how fll accelerate evolution certain types behaviours fll will described its original context spontaneous recovery memory humans citation neural network models citation
MISC--: note fll not unique specific class network architectures although does assume associations learned using form supervised learning
MISC--: humans fll been demonstrated using task participants learned positions letters nonstandard computer keyboard citation
OWNX--: after period forgetting participants relearned proportion letter positions
MISC--: crucially was found this relearning induced recovery non relearned letter positions
MISC--: more recently set theorems provided formal characterization fll linear neural network models citation
MISC--: essence fll occurs neural network models because each association distributed amongst all connection weights between units
OWNX--: after partial forgetting relearning some associations forces all weights closer pre forgetting values resulting improved performance even non relearned associations general proof provided citation
MISC--: geometric demonstration fll network two connection weights given figure
MISC--: networks multiple input output units considered without loss generality citation
OWNX--: protocol used examine fll neural networks follows
MISC--: network n input units one output unit n connection weights
MISC--: this network learns set m n associations where comprises two subsets n n associations respectively
OWNX--: after associations been learned then partially forgotten performance error subset measured
MISC--: finally only relearned then performance error remeasured
MISC--: fll occurs if relearning improves performance
MISC--: been proven probability fll approaches unity number weights increases citation
AIMX--: sake brevity this reflected phrases learning usually improves performance this paper
