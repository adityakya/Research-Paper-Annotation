MISC--: one striking features evolution appearance novel structures organisms
MISC--: recently kirschner gerhart integrated discoveries evolution genetics developmental biology form theory facilitated variation
MISC--: key observation organisms designed random genetic changes channeled phenotypic directions potentially useful
MISC--: open question how fv spontaneously emerges during evolution
AIMX--: here we address this means computer simulations two well studied model systems logic circuits rna secondary structure
OWNX--: we find evolution fv enhanced environments change time time systematic way varying environments made same set subgoals but different combinations
OWNX--: we find organisms evolve under varying goals not only remember their history but also generalize future environments exhibiting high adaptability novel goals
MISC--: rapid adaptation seen goals composed same subgoals novel combinations goals where one subgoals was never seen history organism
OWNX--: mechanisms enhanced generation novelty analyzed way organisms store information their genomes about their past environments
OWNX--: elements facilitated variation theory weak regulatory linkage modularity reduced pleiotropy mutations evolve spontaneously under conditions
OWNX--: thus environments change systematic modular fashion seem promote facilitated variation allow evolution generalize novel conditions
OWNX--: origin ability generate novelty one main mysteries evolution
MISC--: pioneers evolutionary theory including baldwin citation simpson citation waddington citation citation suggested how useful novelty might enhanced physiological adaptations robustness developmental process
OWNX--: early theories were limited lack knowledge molecular mechanisms development
OWNX--: recent decades saw breakthroughs depth understanding molecular developmental biology
MISC--: many findings were unified theory facilitated variation citation presented kirschner gerhart addresses following question how small random genetic changes converted into complex useful innovations
OWNX--: order understand novelty evolution kirschner gerhart integrated observations molecular mechanisms show how current design organism helps determine nature degree future variation
MISC--: key observation organism its intrinsic construction biases both type amount its phenotypic variation response random genetic mutation citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: other words organism seems built way small genetic mutations high chance yielding large phenotypic payoff
MISC--: understand fv important compare related concept evolvability
MISC--: biological system evolvable if readily acquire novel functions through genetic changes help organism survive reproduce future environments citation
MISC--: evolvability composed two aspects variability capacity generate new phenotypes fitness fitness new phenotypes future environments
MISC--: most studies evolvability focused first aspect variability
MISC--: studies measured range diversity phenotypic variation generated given mutation usually without discerning between potentially useful phenotypes non useful ones citation citation
MISC--: fv theory adds previous considerations focusing nature generated variation specifically organism s ability generate novel phenotypes potentially useful
MISC--: facilitated variation made possible certain features biological design
MISC--: one existence weak regulatory linkage citation citation citation where general non instructive signals trigger large pre prepared responses
MISC--: example changes growth hormone concentration at localized position trigger large useful changes shape limb driven conserved mechanisms growth bones muscles blood vessels nerves citation
MISC--: good example ease changing beak shapes any many possible mutations affect concentration single morphogenic factor citation
MISC--: weak regulatory linkage information about output pre built into regulated system without instruction regulator only selects between states
MISC--: regulatory organization reduces constraints evolving new regulations generating complex potentially useful phenotypes
MISC--: additional feature important fv modular design citation citation seen example highly conserved body plan embryo citation citation compartmental organization gene regulation signaling networks citation
MISC--: modularity helps relieve concern mutation might interfere many different parts organism
MISC--: properly designed modularity variation within each module generated without harming other modules citation citation
MISC--: facilitated variation principle studied experimentally example generating mutants scanning types phenotypes generated
MISC--: example study mutants lac regulatory region indicated shape gene input function channeled directions like like functions rather than other possibilities citation
MISC--: open question how does fv spontaneously evolve
MISC--: not clear how selection present environment lead designs increase probability useful changes future environments
MISC--: how does evolutionary theory account emergence special designs make easy generate novel useful variation
MISC--: key point our study observation environments nature do not vary randomly but rather seem common rules regularities citation citation
MISC--: specifically environmental goals faced organisms molecules may thought composed combination subgoals citation
MISC--: when environments change organisms encounter new goal still made same similar subgoals
MISC--: example level organism same subgoals digesting food avoiding predation reproducing must fulfilled each new environment but different nuances combinations
MISC--: level cells same subgoals adhesion signaling must fulfilled each tissue type but different input output signals
MISC--: level proteins same subgoals enzymatic activity binding other proteins regulatory input domains etc shared many proteins but different combinations each case
MISC--: one may thus propose many cases different possible environments share language modularity sense they all made certain combinations set subgoals
MISC--: we thus test possibility under patterned varying environments organism learn over many generations language common environments encountered its past
AIMX--: we ask whether fv arises systematically varying environments measuring ability simple model systems adapt new previously unseen goals same language past goals
MISC--: we employ two well studied model systems combinatorial logic circuits citation citation rna secondary structure citation
BASE--: we find standard experiment setting goal remains constant over time leads highly optimized systems show little fv
MISC--: contrast fv readily generated under modularly varying goals goals change over time but share same subgoals citation
OWNX--: we find mvg evolution enhances ability generate novel phenotypes long novelty modular phenotypes novel modules novel combinations modules
OWNX--: we show organisms under mvg store information about past goals their genomes evolve weak linkage allows small genetic changes unleash large phenotypic responses do not ruin modular structure organism
CONT--: our study thus suggests environments change systematic fashion promote evolution facilitated variation leave imprint evolvability properties organisms allowing them generalize new conditions same language past conditions
