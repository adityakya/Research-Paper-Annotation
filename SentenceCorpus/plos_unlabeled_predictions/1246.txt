MISC--: off direction selective ganglion cell mammalian retinas responds most strongly stimulus moving specific direction
OWNX--: dsgc initiates spikes its dendritic tree thought propagate soma high probability
MISC--: both dendritic somatic spikes dsgc display strong directional tuning whereas somatic psps only weakly directional indicating spike generation includes marked enhancement directional signal
OWNX--: we used realistic computational model based anatomical physiological measurements determine source enhancement
OWNX--: our results indicate dsgc dendritic tree partitioned into separate electrotonic regions each summing its local excitatory inhibitory synaptic inputs initiate spikes
MISC--: within each local region local spike threshold nonlinearly amplifies preferred response over null response basis psp amplitude
BASE--: using inhibitory conductances previously measured dsgcs simulation results showed inhibition only sufficient prevent spike initiation cannot affect spike propagation
MISC--: therefore inhibition will only act locally within dendritic arbor
OWNX--: we identified role three mechanisms generate directional selectivity local dendritic regions
OWNX--: first mechanism ds intrinsic dendritic structure dsgc enhances ds null side cell s dendritic tree weakens preferred side
MISC--: second spatially offset postsynaptic inhibition generates robust ds isolated dendritic tips but weak ds near soma
MISC--: third presynaptic ds apparently necessary because more robust across dendritic tree
OWNX--: pre postsynaptic mechanisms together overcome local intrinsic ds
OWNX--: local dendritic mechanisms perform independent nonlinear computations make decision there could analogous mechanisms within cortical circuitry
MISC--: off direction selective ganglion cell mammalian retina spikes vigorously moving stimuli but only weakly stationary light spots
MISC--: responds most strongly over limited range stimulus directions direction producing maximal response called preferred direction while stimulus moving opposite direction called null direction produces little no response citation
OWNX--: we refer directionally tuned spike responses direction selective
OWNX--: off dsgcs sharply bistratified neurons respond transient depolarization burst spikes at both onset termination bright stimulus within receptive field
MISC--: similarly leading edge bright bar crossing receptive field will produce transient response if bar wide relative dendritic extent speed low enough trailing edge will produce distinct temporally separate off response
MISC--: their original description dsgc barlow levick citation noted direction selective spike output was produced stimuli covered only small fraction dendritic arbor
MISC--: they proposed synaptic mechanism comprised subunits were repeated array across receptive field
MISC--: contrast most ganglion cells initiate spikes axon initial segment dsgc initiates spikes dendritic tree citation
OWNX--: dendritic spikes thought propagate soma initiate somatic spike similar neurons other regions brain where dendritic spiking important signal processing citation
OWNX--: observations suggest some type local dendritic processing could provide basis proposed subunits
OWNX--: evidence dendritic spiking dsgc was observed low amplitude spikelets appear when somatic spiking suppressed local application tetrodotoxin soma hyperpolarizing soma citation
OWNX--: dendritic spikes hypothesized initiate somatic spikes high probability because they rarely seen under normal conditions
MISC--: further both somatic dendritic spiking responses strongly tuned preferred direction stimuli whereas somatic graded potential shows relatively weak directional tuning citation citation
OWNX--: this implies dsgc does not employ mechanism used most other ganglion cells synaptic integration where spikes initiated at soma reflect summation synaptic inputs over dendritic tree citation
OWNX--: instead suggests dsgc dendrites sum synaptic inputs generate local spikes then propagate soma process amplifying responses directional selectivity
MISC--: addition dendritic spiking dsgc other mechanisms also important generating its direction selective response
MISC--: gabaergic inhibition essential presynaptic mechanisms render both excitatory inhibitory synaptic inputs dsgc directionally tuned citation citation
MISC--: both excitatory inhibitory inputs vary amplitude relative timing function direction
MISC--: further postsynaptic integration excitatory inhibitory inputs been hypothesized contribute ds signals citation citation
MISC--: postsynaptic inhibition resulting null direction movement could produce ds signals two ways could block propagation dendritic spikes could block their initiation citation citation citation
OWNX--: however relative contributions presynaptic postsynaptic mechanisms ds spiking dsgc remains unclear
OWNX--: initial theoretical studies suggested postsynaptic mechanisms might suffice citation this received some experimental support citation
MISC--: however more recently presynaptic mechanisms appeared most significant citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: we wanted revisit this issue delineate relative contributions presynaptic postsynaptic mechanisms calibrated model
OWNX--: investigate how dendritic processing synaptic psps could amplify ds we constructed multi compartment biophysical models dsgcs digitized tracer injected morphologies calibrated physiological data obtained prior tracer injection
OWNX--: we stimulated models moving light bars activated synaptic inputs
MISC--: goal was explore how morphology voltage gated channels synaptic inhibition affect initiation propagation dendritic spikes compare known physiological properties
OWNX--: our simulations show sub threshold psps distal dendritic regions off dsgc heavily attenuated propagation soma but spikes initiated within local dendritic regions propagate high probability soma back propagate remainder dendritic tree
MISC--: therefore active amplification ds appears take place during spike initiation dendrites
