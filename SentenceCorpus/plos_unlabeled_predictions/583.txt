MISC--: pavlovian predictions future aversive outcomes lead behavioral inhibition suppression withdrawal
MISC--: there considerable evidence involvement serotonin both learning predictions inhibitory consequences ensue although less causal relationship between two
OWNX--: context highly simplified model chains affectively charged thoughts we interpret combined effects serotonin terms pruning tree possible decisions
OWNX--: we show how drop behavioral inhibition putatively resulting experimentally psychiatrically influenced drop serotonin could result unexpectedly large negative prediction errors significant aversive shift reinforcement statistics
MISC--: we suggest interpretation this finding helps dissolve apparent contradiction between fact inhibition serotonin reuptake first line treatment depression although serotonin itself most strongly linked aversive rather than appetitive outcomes predictions
MISC--: serotonin neuromodulator appears play critical role wealth psychiatric conditions including depression anxiety panic obsessive compulsions
MISC--: however despite importance serotonergic pharmacotherapies notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors roles serotonin plays normal abnormal function still mysterious
OWNX--: we start three particular findings
MISC--: first ht involved prediction aversive events possibly form opponent citation citation dopamine citation citation
MISC--: second ht involved behavioral inhibition citation citation preventing curtailing ongoing actions light predictions aversive outcomes
MISC--: third finding collection psychopharmacological data implicating ht animal models depression anxiety citation citation together fact depleting ht human subjects who recovered depression reinstate acute at times fulminant re experience subjective symptoms disease assessed various rating scales citation citation
MISC--: furthermore while ssris used treatment depression genetically induced constitutive decreases efficiency ht reuptake risk factor depression citation citation
MISC--: findings hard connect second fact seems orthogonal first third themselves apparent contradiction
MISC--: if ht really involved predicting aversive outcomes then depleting should surely positive rather than negative affective consequences
OWNX--: we suggest missing link comes considering interactions between pavlovian predictions ongoing action selection
MISC--: interaction seen conditioned suppression citation standard workhorse test aversive predictions
MISC--: animals trained emit appetitive instrumental actions associate light shock
MISC--: presentation light during instrumental performance reduces rate at animals emit those responses
MISC--: neither theoretical nor neurobiological status this interaction completely resolved though there some evidence involvement ht nucleus accumbens its realization citation citation
MISC--: here we treat subset inhibitory processes associated gray s behavioral inhibition system citation citation citation citation terms what might called preparatory pavlovian response
MISC--: consummatory pavlovian responses pre programmed reactions presence affectively significant outcomes food water threats
MISC--: preparatory pavlovian responses similarly pre programmed responses predictions those outcomes
MISC--: even though predictions learned responses not may therefore behaviorally inappropriate certain circumstances citation citation
MISC--: our purposes long noted deakin graeff citation most important preparatory pavlovian response prediction threat citation inhibition form withdrawal disengagement
OWNX--: this explicitly links first two findings discussed above inhibition directly associated aversive predictions
AIMX--: explore consequences reflexive direct inhibition action learning affective settings together repercussions when ht compromised we built highly simplified model sought isolate effects more general learning effects
OWNX--: more specifically we built model trains thoughts
OWNX--: our treatment we considered thoughts actions lead one belief state next
OWNX--: trains thought gained value through their connections group terminal states were preassigned either positive negative affective values
OWNX--: ht directly inhibited chains thought predicted lead toward negative terminal states
MISC--: our model seen terms ht s pruning decision tree outcome states choices citation citation
OWNX--: we argue results tryptophan depletion above now emerge when considering consequences this reflexive behavioral inhibition ongoing learning about world subsequent action choice predictions
MISC--: most notable effect model critical bias toward optimistic valuation
MISC--: states actions potentially negative consequences under explored incorrectly valued because reflexive inhibition
MISC--: when inhibition fails though last three issues mentioned above there two adverse consequences
MISC--: first inhibition no longer crutch instrumental action choice so subjects learn avoid potentially bad situations rather than being able rely this reflexive mechanism
MISC--: second due mismatch between policy value function characteristic inconsistencies between predicted actual values arise actual values encountered being more negative than predicted though also actually more realistic
MISC--: this mismatch between policy value function also leads overall reduction rewards obtained
MISC--: boosting ht model again restores status quo
OWNX--: course this highly simplified model cannot possibly itself accommodate all diverse confusing roles ht
OWNX--: nevertheless replicates some prominent behavioral pharmacological facets depression anxiety humans animal models we return discussion
OWNX--: next section defines model trains thought more formally
OWNX--: results section considers normal learning consequences impairments ht processing
OWNX--: we save discussion broader discussion data theories pertaining ht
