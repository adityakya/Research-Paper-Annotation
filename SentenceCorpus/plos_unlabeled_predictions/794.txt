OWNX--: numerous studies currently underway characterize microbial communities inhabiting our world
OWNX--: studies aim dramatically expand our understanding microbial biosphere more importantly hope reveal secrets complex symbiotic relationship between us our commensal bacterial microflora
MISC--: important prerequisite discoveries computational tools able rapidly accurately compare large datasets generated complex bacterial communities identify features distinguish them
OWNX--: we present statistical method comparing clinical metagenomic samples two treatment populations basis count data detect differentially abundant features
OWNX--: our method metastats employs false discovery rate improve specificity high complexity environments separately handles sparsely sampled features using fisher s exact test
OWNX--: under variety simulations we show metastats performs well compared previously used methods significantly outperforms other methods features sparse counts
OWNX--: we demonstrate utility our method several datasets including s rrna survey obese lean human gut microbiomes cog functional profiles infant mature gut microbiomes bacterial viral metabolic subsystem data inferred random sequencing metagenomes
OWNX--: application our method obesity dataset reveals differences between obese lean subjects not reported original study
OWNX--: cog subsystem datasets we provide first statistically rigorous assessment differences between populations
AIMX--: methods described this paper first address clinical metagenomic datasets comprising samples multiple subjects
OWNX--: our methods robust across datasets varied complexity sampling level
OWNX--: while designed metagenomic applications our software also applied digital gene expression studies
OWNX--: web server implementation our methods freely available source code found at link
MISC--: increasing availability high throughput inexpensive sequencing technologies led birth new scientific field metagenomics encompassing large scale analyses microbial communities
OWNX--: broad sequencing bacterial populations allows us first glimpse at many microbes cannot analyzed through traditional means
MISC--: studies environmental samples initially focused targeted sequencing individual genes particular s subunit ribosomal rna citation citation though more recent studies take advantage high throughput shotgun sequencing methods assess not only taxonomic composition but also functional capacity microbial community citation citation
MISC--: several software tools been developed recent years comparing different environments basis sequence data
MISC--: dotur citation libshuff citation libshuff citation sons citation megan citation unifrac citation treeclimber citation all focus different aspects analysis
MISC--: dotur clusters sequences into operational taxonomic units provides estimates diversity microbial population thereby providing coarse measure comparing different communities
MISC--: sons extends dotur statistic estimating similarity between two environments specifically fraction otus shared between two communities
MISC--: libshuff libshuff provide hypothesis test deciding whether two communities different treeclimber unifrac frame this question phylogenetic context
MISC--: note methods aim assess whether rather than how two communities differ
MISC--: latter question particularly important we begin analyze contribution microbiome human health
MISC--: metagenomic analysis clinical trials will require information at individual taxonomic levels guide future experiments treatments
OWNX--: example we would like identify bacteria whose presence absence contributes human disease develop antibiotic probiotic treatments
MISC--: this question was first addressed rodriguez brito et al citation who use bootstrapping estimate p value associated differences between abundance biological subsytems
MISC--: more recently software megan huson et al citation provides graphical interface allows users compare taxonomic composition different environments
MISC--: note megan only one among programs mentioned above applied data other than obtained s rrna surveys
OWNX--: tools share one common limitation they all designed comparing exactly two samples therefore limited applicability clinical setting where goal compare two treatment populations each comprising multiple samples
AIMX--: this paper we describe rigorous statistical approach detecting differentially abundant features between clinical metagenomic datasets
OWNX--: this method applicable both high throughput metagenomic data s rrna surveys
CONT--: our approach extends statistical methods originally developed microarray analysis
OWNX--: specifically we adapt methods discrete count data correct sparse counts
OWNX--: our research was motivated increasing focus metagenomic projects clinical applications
OWNX--: note similar problem been addressed context digital gene expression studies
MISC--: lu et al citation employ overdispersed log linear model robinson smyth citation use negative binomial distribution analysis multiple sage libraries
MISC--: both approaches applied metagenomic datasets
OWNX--: we compare our tool prior methodologies through comprehensive simulations demonstrate performance our approach analyzing publicly available datasets including s surveys human gut microbiota random sequencing based functional surveys infant mature gut microbiomes microbial viral metagenomes
AIMX--: methods described this paper been implemented web server also available free source code link
