MISC--: early identification adverse effect preclinical commercial drugs crucial developing highly efficient therapeutics since unexpected adverse drug effects account one third all drug failures drug development
OWNX--: correlate protein drug interactions at molecule level their clinical outcomes at organism level we developed integrated approach studying protein ligand interactions structural proteome wide scale combining protein functional site similarity search small molecule screening protein ligand binding affinity profile analysis
OWNX--: applying this methodology we elucidated possible molecular mechanism previously observed but molecularly uncharacterized side effect selective estrogen receptor modulators
MISC--: side effect involves inhibition sacroplasmic reticulum ca ion channel atpase protein transmembrane domain
MISC--: prediction provides molecular insight into reducing adverse effect serms supported clinical vitro observations
OWNX--: strategy used this case study being applied discover off targets other commercially available pharmaceuticals
MISC--: process included drug discovery pipeline effort optimize drug leads reduce unwanted side effects
MISC--: early identification adverse effects preclinical commercial drugs crucial developing highly efficient therapeutics since unexpected adverse drug effects contribute one third all drug failures late stage drug development citation
MISC--: conventional practices identifying off targets rely counterscreen compounds against large number enzymes receptors vitro citation citation
MISC--: computational approaches could not only save time costs spent during vitro screening providing candidate list potential off targets but also provide insight into understanding molecular mechanisms protein drug interactions
MISC--: been shown potential off targets identified silico establishing structure activity relationship small molecules citation citation
MISC--: however success ligand based methods strongly depends availability coverage chemical structures used training few them directly take target d structure into account
MISC--: although assessment protein ligand interactions docking studies at atomic level extremely valuable understanding molecular mechanism adverse therapeutic effects citation citation protein ligand docking large scale hindered biased structural coverage human proteome citation lack practical methodologies accurately estimate binding affinity citation
MISC--: here we approach problem different direction postulating proteins similar binding sites likely bind similar ligands citation
OWNX--: this study we test this postulate predicting potential off target binding sites selective estrogen receptor modulators
MISC--: several commercial drugs targeting estrogen receptor alpha been developed treat breast cancers other diseases citation
MISC--: however therapy drugs tamoxifen associated undesirable side effects cardiac abnormalities citation thromboembolic disorders citation ocular toxicity citation
OWNX--: identify off targets serms attempt elucidate molecular mechanisms explaining their adverse effects we searched similar ligand binding sites across fold functional space using template known serm binding site er
OWNX--: search used robust scalable functional site prediction comparison algorithm developed recently our laboratory xie bourne submitted
MISC--: consequently similar inhibitor site detected sacroplasmic reticulum ca ion channel atpase protein
MISC--: prediction further verified detailed protein ligand docking surface electrostatic potential analysis
OWNX--: our prediction correlates well clinical biochemical observations providing molecular insight into reducing adverse effect serms
OWNX--: strategy used this case study could applied discover off targets other commercially available pharmaceuticals repurpose existing drugs treat different diseases xie kinnings bourne preparation
MISC--: process could also included drug discovery development pipeline effort optimize drug leads reduce unwanted side effects
