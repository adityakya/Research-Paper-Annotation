MISC--: whole genome transporter analyses been conducted organisms whose complete genome sequences available
MISC--: each organism complete set membrane transport systems was identified predicted functions classified into protein families based transporter classification system
MISC--: organisms larger genome sizes generally possessed relatively greater number transport systems
MISC--: prokaryotes unicellular eukaryotes significant factor increase transporter content genome size was greater diversity transporter types
MISC--: contrast multicellular eukaryotes greater number paralogs specific transporter families was more important factor increase transporter content genome size
MISC--: both eukaryotic prokaryotic intracellular pathogens endosymbionts exhibited markedly limited transport capabilities
MISC--: hierarchical clustering phylogenetic profiles transporter families derived presence absence certain transporter family showed clustering patterns organisms were correlated both their evolutionary history their overall physiology lifestyles
