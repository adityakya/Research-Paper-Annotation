MISC--: many neurons epochs they fire action potentials approximately periodic fashion
AIMX--: see what effects noise relatively small amplitude repetitive activity we recently examined response hodgkin huxley space clamped system noise mean variance applied current vary near bifurcation periodic firing
MISC--: this article concerned more realistic neuron model includes spatial extent
MISC--: employing hodgkin huxley partial differential equation system deterministic component input current restricted small segment whereas stochastic component extends over region may may not overlap deterministic component
OWNX--: mean values below near above critical values repetitive spiking effects weak noise increasing strength ascertained simulation
MISC--: point model small amplitude noise near critical value dampens spiking activity leads minimum noise level increases
OWNX--: this was case both additive noise conductance based noise
MISC--: uniform noise along whole neuron only marginally more effective silencing cell than noise occurs near region excitation
MISC--: fact found if signal noise overlap spatial extent then weak noise may inhibit spiking
MISC--: if however signal noise applied disjoint intervals then noise no effect spiking activity no matter how large its region application though trajectories naturally altered slightly noise
MISC--: effects could not discerned point model important real neuron behavior
MISC--: interference spike train does nevertheless occur when noise amplitude larger even when noise signal do not overlap being due instigation secondary noise induced wave phenomena rather than switching system one attractor another
