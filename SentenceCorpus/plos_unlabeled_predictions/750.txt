MISC--: cellular response elicited environmental cue typically varies strength stimulus
MISC--: example yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae concentration mating pheromone determines whether cells undergo vegetative growth chemotropic growth mating
OWNX--: this implies signaling pathways responsible detecting stimulus initiating response must transmit quantitative information about intensity signal
OWNX--: our previous experimental results suggest yeast encode pheromone concentration duration transmitted signal
AIMX--: here we use mathematical modeling analyze possible biochemical mechanisms performing this dose duration conversion
OWNX--: we demonstrate modulation signal duration increases range stimulus concentrations dose dependent responses possible this increased dynamic range produces counterintuitive result signaling beyond saturation dose dependent responses still possible after apparent saturation receptors
AIMX--: we propose mechanism dose duration encoding yeast pheromone pathway consistent current experimental observations
OWNX--: most previous investigations information processing signaling pathways focused amplitude encoding without considering temporal aspects signal transduction
OWNX--: here we demonstrate dose duration encoding provides cells alternative mechanism processing transmitting quantitative information about their surrounding environment
OWNX--: ability signaling pathways convert stimulus strength into signal duration results directly nonlinear nature systems emphasizes importance considering dynamic properties signaling pathways when characterizing their behavior
OWNX--: understanding how signaling pathways encode transmit quantitative information about external environment will not only deepen our understanding systems but also provide insight into how reestablish proper function pathways become dysregulated disease
OWNX--: many substances hormones neurotransmitters variety pharmaceuticals affect cellular behavior binding membrane receptors activating intracellular signaling pathways
OWNX--: pathways transmit information plasma membrane selected cellular components generate appropriate response environmental cue
MISC--: however signaling networks not simply passive relay systems but actively modulate transmitted signals
OWNX--: example cross inhibition used avoid spurious crosstalk between pathways
MISC--: similarly negative feedback allows pathways adapt desensitize persistent stimuli citation citation
MISC--: many cases nature response depends dose stimulus
MISC--: thus addition relaying qualitative information signaling pathways must also transmit quantitative information about intensity stimulus
MISC--: many signaling pathways consist cell surface receptor g protein transducer series protein kinases including mitogen activated protein kinase
MISC--: this architecture widely employed mammalian cells but also found single cell eukaryotes yeast citation
MISC--: pheromone response pathway yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae provides instructive example elicited cellular response depends concentration stimulus
OWNX--: at low pheromone levels cells continue vegetative growth
MISC--: at intermediate concentrations cells develop elongated morphology presence pheromone gradient growth directed source stimulus process known chemotropic growth citation citation
MISC--: finally at high pheromone concentrations cells initiate mating program eventually leads growth arrest development mating projections
MISC--: therefore yeast make correct developmental decision quantitative information about pheromone concentration must reliably transmitted appropriate cellular components
BASE--: here we use mathematical modeling investigate different ways this information transferred
OWNX--: results this analysis taken together our recently published data demonstrate pheromone pathway uses strategy agonist dose encoded duration signal
MISC--: because yeast pheromone response pathway consists g protein coupled receptor map kinase cascade results our investigations should direct implications signal transduction mammalian cells
