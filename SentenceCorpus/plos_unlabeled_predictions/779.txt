MISC--: however protein function prediction itself difficult problem formulate since difficult define function citation citation
MISC--: various functional definition schemes been developed over years addressed various aspects protein function
OWNX--: instead adopting existing functional definition scheme we proposed probe role individual amino acid residues protein function regardless functional definition schemes used
MISC--: cases protein function represented simply series quantitative values each indicates functional importance corresponding amino acid residue protein sequence structure
OWNX--: calculate quantitative values each residue we used combined approach meta functional signature takes into account individual scores various function prediction algorithms generates composite score each amino acid residue given protein
OWNX--: currently our signature generation protocol consists following four types scores four different types information sequence conservation evolutionary conservation structural stability amino acid type
MISC--: all scores generated via conceptually simple easily implementable algorithms their combined use outperforms sophisticated algorithms use only one source information
MISC--: sequence conservation one most utilized methods measuring functional importance individual amino acids
MISC--: amino acid residues more conservative variation patterns usually more important preservation protein function

OWNX--: our current mfs generation protocol we used two rapdf based scoring functions measure how all mutated structures deviate each other how experimentally determined structure differs mutated structures represent potential impact stability position naturally occurring residue respectively
MISC--: scores separate residues conserved structure versus function
MISC--: additional component meta functional signature information type amino acids histidine cysteine more likely located functional sites than other amino acids
