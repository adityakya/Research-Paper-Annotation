MISC--: many pathogens exist phenotypically distinct strains interact each other through competition hosts
MISC--: general models describe multi strain systems extremely difficult analyze because their state spaces enormously large
CONT--: reduced models been proposed but so far all them necessarily allow coinfections require immunity mediated solely reduced infectivity potentially problematic assumption
OWNX--: here we suggest new state space reduction approach allows immunity mediated either reduced infectivity reduced susceptibility naturally used models without coinfections
OWNX--: our approach utilizes general framework status based models
OWNX--: cornerstone our method introduction immunity variables describe multi strain systems more naturally than traditional tracking susceptible infected hosts
OWNX--: models expressed this way approximated natural way truncation method akin moment closure allowing us sharply reduce size state space thus consider models many strains tractable manner
OWNX--: applying our method phenomenon antigenic drift influenza we propose potentially general mechanism could constrain viral evolution one dimensional manifold two dimensional trait space
MISC--: our framework broadens class multi strain systems adequately described reduced models
MISC--: permits computational even analytical investigation thus serves useful tool understanding evolution ecology multi strain pathogens
MISC--: microbial pathogens tremendously diverse
MISC--: pathogens cause one same disease may differ remarkably both their genotype their phenotype like hiv aids citation influenza citation malaria citation meningitis citation
MISC--: phenotypically different variants same pathogen called strains
MISC--: if several strains exist host population they interact each other two ways
MISC--: first type interaction may referred ecological interference citation citation
MISC--: many infectious diseases host infected one strain removed duration disease population hosts susceptible pathogen
OWNX--: this because immune system host becomes activated upon infection first strain so hard second strain enter replicate this host infected host may physically removed susceptible population dying staying at home
MISC--: ecological interference takes place even between unrelated pathogens citation
MISC--: second type interaction referred cross immunity interference specific different strains same pathogen confer full partial immunity each other
MISC--: this means host infected one strain becomes substantially less susceptible certain other strains pathogen prolonged period time after initial infection cleared
MISC--: cross immunity highest between phenotypically similar strains
MISC--: since phenotypic similarity usually implies recent common ancestry pathogen s ecology thus intrinsically entangled its evolution
OWNX--: understanding dynamics multi strain pathogens at general theoretical level turns out extremely difficult
MISC--: numerous models been proposed during past twenty years
MISC--: although models share many similarities they substantially differ particulars often resulting conflicting model predictions
MISC--: consequence there little agreement how best gain insights into ecology evolution multi strain pathogens
MISC--: models multi strain pathogens either equation agent based
MISC--: agent individual based models recently become increasingly elaborate interesting citation citation largely due increase computational capabilities
OWNX--: since models however not designed analytical tractability we do not dwell this type model here
MISC--: virtually all equation based models disease dynamics traced back compartment model introduced kermack mckendrick citation
MISC--: models also known sir models reflecting host population s partitioning into susceptible infected recovered individuals
MISC--: problem arises immediately when attempting extend this classical sir framework multiple strains number state variables typically also parameters increases exponentially number strains citation citation
CONT--: this presents not only computational challenges but also draws attention fundamental conceptual difficulty even moderately large number strains resultant number state variables quickly surpasses any realistic host population size
MISC--: most compartments model therefore consist few individuals if they occupied at all effects demographic stochasticity must then not neglected
MISC--: avoid this complication existing approaches modeling multi strain pathogens attempted reduce number model compartments
MISC--: usually reductions valid only under certain sets assumptions may may not adequate depending modeled phenomenon
MISC--: thus important expand set assumptions under reduced models applicable
BASE--: our work presented here contributes this goal
MISC--: traditionally full models been developed based assumption reduced susceptibility implies immune hosts able block off infection completely certain probability citation citation
MISC--: other hand all existing reduced models rely assumption reduced infectivity implies all hosts immune not get infected same probability but those possess immunity become less infectious than those who do not citation citation
MISC--: reality most likely lies somewhere between two abstractions
OWNX--: nevertheless we discuss model section reduced susceptibility assumption seems more plausible
AIMX--: this study we develop state space reduction approach applied under either assumptions models without coinfections
OWNX--: our approach differs existing ones produces collection models approximate full models desired degree accuracy
MISC--: number variables needed resulting approximations grows algebraically number n strains rather than exponentially when n large difference between e g n n enormous former growing much more slowly than latter
OWNX--: if coinfections reduced infectivity assumed our approach produces model equivalent gog grenfell citation
AIMX--: illustrate utility our approach reduced models general we demonstrate its application phenomenon drift influenza using reduced models we able simulate up strains
OWNX--: influenza multi strain pathogen whose epidemiology evolution display intricate interaction pattern
MISC--: because human immune system produce protective antibodies against influenza s surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin individuals gain lifelong immunity against each strain virus they been infected citation citation
MISC--: this results complex partitioning human host population according immunity individuals different influenza strains
MISC--: ensuing frequency dependent selection thought drive evolution influenza giving rise process known antigenic drift citation
MISC--: lapedes farber citation shown antigenic space influenza approximately five dimensional
MISC--: subsequently smith et al citation argued first two principal dimensions most important
MISC--: moreover follows results smith et al temporal evolution influenza s h n subtype proceeds along single line antigenic space i e antigenic clusters corresponding different years well separated along first principal dimension
MISC--: this agrees observation phylogenetic tree subtype h n possesses single trunk citation
MISC--: other words even though h n subtype experiences substantial genetic diversity during each epidemic season only one progeny strain survives longer run
MISC--: accordingly number coexisting h n strains does not grow year year
MISC--: few recent studies attempted model thereby explain phenomenon antigenic drift influenza apart individual based models most studies consider one dimensional strain space some sort traveling wave behavior observed citation citation citation
MISC--: constrain evolution virus one dimension two dimensional strain space been necessary require strain space was essentially unviable except relatively thin region along one axis citation
MISC--: recent study koelle et al citation took different approach succeeded constraining diversity virus living high dimensional sequence space
MISC--: authors explicitly mapped viral genotypes phenotypes showed single trunk phylogeny influenza may consequence neutral network structure influenza genotype space
MISC--: however open question properties phenotype space sufficient constrain viral diversity course its evolution
MISC--: recker et al citation suggest one explanation
MISC--: they argue succession antigenically distinct variants may intrinsic feature dynamics limited set antigenic types always present host population thus decoupled genetic evolution virus
OWNX--: here we suggest alternative conceptual scenario follows more traditional view antigenic drift genetic evolution tightly connected
OWNX--: however we deliberately avoid problem mapping genotypes phenotypes instead assume relatively simple structure phenotype space rectangular lattice
OWNX--: our model offers straightforward explanation what could happening phenotype space order diversity virus constrained long run
BASE--: our work thus complementary koelle et al citation
MISC--: our two dimensional phenotype space each coordinate captures changes conformations epitope local region surface hemagglutinin molecule interacts immune system citation citation
OWNX--: we then investigate scenario immune response hosts depends two epitopes full immune protection gained against all strains sharing epitopic conformation previous infection
BASE--: this respect our model closely related models studied gupta colleagues citation citation citation
AIMX--: we show evolutionary trajectory influenza virus our model follows line even though model s strain space two dimensional
MISC--: this finding agrees observed single trunk phylogeny influenza s h n subtype citation
