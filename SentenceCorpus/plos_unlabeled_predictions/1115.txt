OWNX--: alteration normal regulation cell cycle progression division death lies at heart processes driving tumorigenesis
MISC--: detailed molecular understanding processes provides opportunity design targeted anti cancer agents
MISC--: term targeted therapy refers drugs focused mechanism specifically act well defined protein targets biological pathways when altered therapy impair abnormal proliferation cancer cells

MISC--: absence prolonged clinical responses many cases however stresses importance continued basic studies into mechanisms targeted drugs their failure clinic
MISC--: acquired drug resistance important reason failure targeted therapies
MISC--: resistance emerges due drug metabolism drug export alteration drug target mutation deletion overexpression
MISC--: depending cancer type its stage therapy administered genetic background patient one several genetic alterations may necessary confer drug resistance cells
AIMX--: this paper we investigate drug resistance emerging due single alteration

MISC--: design optimal drug administration schedules minimize risk resistance represents important issue clinical cancer research
MISC--: currently many targeted drugs administered continuously at sufficiently low doses so no drug holidays necessary limit side effects
MISC--: alternatively drug may administered at higher doses short pulses followed rest periods allow recovery toxicity
MISC--: clinical studies evaluating advantages different approaches been ambivalent
MISC--: some investigations found low dose continuous strategy more effective citation while others advocated more concentrated dosages citation
MISC--: effectiveness low dose continuous approach often attributed its targeted effect tumor endothelial cells prevention angiogenesis rather than low rates resistance citation
MISC--: continuous dosing strategy often implemented combination therapy sometimes including second drug administered at higher dose pulsed fashion
MISC--: significant amount research effort been devoted developing mathematical models tumor growth response chemotherapy
OWNX--: seminal paper norton simon proposed model kinetic resistance cell cycle specific therapy tumor growth followed gompertzian law citation
MISC--: authors used differential equation model rate cell kill was proportional rate growth unperturbed tumor given size
OWNX--: they suggested one way combating slowing rate tumor regression was increase intensity treatment tumor became smaller thus increasing chance cure
MISC--: authors also published review clinical trials employing dosing schedules related their proposed dose intensification strategy concluded concept intensification was clinically feasible possibly efficacious citation
MISC--: later predictions extension this model were validated clinical trial evaluating effects dose dense strategy conventional regimen chemotherapy citation
MISC--: their model its predictions become known norton simon hypothesis generated substantial interest mathematical modeling chemotherapy kinetic resistance
OWNX--: example dibrov colleagues formulated kinetic cell cycle model describe cell synchronization cycle phase specific blockers citation this model was then used optimizing treatment schedules increase degree synchronization thus effectiveness cycle specific drug

MISC--: there also been substantial research efforts devoted developing mathematical models genetic resistance i e resistance driven genetic alterations cancer cells
MISC--: since mutations conferring resistance arise random events during dna replication phase cell division dynamics resistant populations well suited description stochastic mathematical models
OWNX--: coldman co authors pioneered this field introducing stochastic models resistance against chemotherapy guide treatment schedules
MISC--: coldman goldie studied emergence resistance one two functionally equivalent chemotherapeutic drugs using branching process model tumor growth differentiation hierarchy citation
OWNX--: this model birth death rates cells were time independent constants each sensitive cell division gave rise resistant cell certain probability
MISC--: effect drug was modeled additional probabilistic cell kill law existing population drug could administered fixed dose at series fixed time points
MISC--: goal model was schedule sequential administration both drugs order maximize probability cure
MISC--: later assumption equivalence symmetry between two drugs was relaxed citation
OWNX--: models were also extended include toxic effects chemotherapy normal tissue optimal control problem was formulated maximize probability tumor cure without toxicity citation
MISC--: more recently iwasa colleagues used multi type birth death process model study probability resistance emerging due one multiple mutations populations under selection pressure citation
MISC--: authors considered pre existing resistance mutations determined optimum intervention strategy utilizing multiple drugs
MISC--: multi drug resistance was also investigated using multi type birth death process model work komarova wodarz citation citation
