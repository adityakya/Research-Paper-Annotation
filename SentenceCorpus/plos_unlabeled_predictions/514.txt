MISC--: merging network theory microarray data analysis techniques spawned new field gene coexpression network analysis
MISC--: while network methods increasingly used biology network vocabulary computational biologists tends far more limited than say social network theorists
MISC--: here we review propose several potentially useful network concepts
MISC--: we take advantage relationship between network theory field microarray data analysis clarify meaning relationship among network concepts gene coexpression networks
MISC--: network theory offers wealth intuitive concepts describing pairwise relationships among genes depicted cluster trees heat maps
MISC--: conversely microarray data analysis techniques also used address difficult problems network theory
MISC--: we describe conditions when close relationship exists between network analysis microarray data analysis techniques provide rough dictionary translating between two fields
MISC--: using angular interpretation correlations we provide geometric interpretation network theoretic concepts derive unexpected relationships among them
MISC--: we use singular value decomposition module expression data characterize approximately factorizable gene coexpression networks i e adjacency matrices factor into node specific contributions
OWNX--: high low level views coexpression networks allow us study relationships among modules among module genes respectively
OWNX--: we characterize coexpression networks where hub genes significant respect microarray sample trait show network concept intramodular connectivity interpreted fuzzy measure module membership
OWNX--: we illustrate our results using human mouse yeast microarray gene expression data
MISC--: unification coexpression network methods traditional data mining methods inform application development systems biologic methods
MISC--: many biological networks share topological properties
MISC--: common global properties include modular organization citation citation presence highly connected hub nodes approximate scale free topology citation citation
MISC--: common local topological properties include presence recurring patterns interconnections regulation networks citation citation
MISC--: one goal this article describe existing novel network concepts used describe local global network properties
MISC--: example clustering coefficient citation network concept measures cohesiveness neighborhood node
MISC--: we particularly interested network concepts defined regard gene significance measure
MISC--: gene significance measures great practical importance since they allow one incorporate external gene information into network analysis
MISC--: functional enrichment analysis gene significance measure could indicate pathway membership
OWNX--: gene knock out experiments gene significance could indicate knock out essentiality
OWNX--: we study gene significance measures since microarray sample trait gives rise statistical measure gene significance
MISC--: example student t test differential expression leads gene significance measure
MISC--: many traditional microarray data analysis methods focus relationship between microarray sample trait gene expression data
OWNX--: example gene filtering methods aim find list genes significantly associated microarray sample trait another example microarray based prediction methods aim accurately predict sample trait basis gene expression data
MISC--: gene expression profiles across microarray samples highly correlated natural describe their pairwise relations using network language
MISC--: genes similar expression patterns may form complexes pathways participate regulatory signaling circuits citation citation
MISC--: gene coexpression networks been used describe transcriptome many organisms e g yeast flies worms plants mice humans citation citation
MISC--: gene coexpression network methods also been used typical microarray data analysis tasks gene filtering citation citation citation outcome prediction citation citation
MISC--: while utility network methods analyzing microarray data been demonstrated numerous publications utility microarray data analysis techniques solving network theoretic problems not yet been fully appreciated
OWNX--: one goal this article show simple geometric arguments used derive network theoretic results if networks defined basis correlation matrix
MISC--: although many our network concepts will useful general networks we particularly interested gene coexpression networks
OWNX--: gene coexpression networks built basis gene coexpression measure
MISC--: network nodes correspond genes more precisely gene expression profiles
OWNX--: ith gene expression profile x i vector whose components report gene expression values across m microarrays
OWNX--: we define coexpression similarity s ij between genes i j absolute value correlation coefficient between their expression profiles formula
MISC--: using thresholding procedure this coexpression similarity transformed into measure connection strength
MISC--: unweighted network adjacency ij between gene expression profiles x i x j defined hard thresholding coexpression similarity s ij followsformulawhere hard threshold parameter
MISC--: thus two genes linked if absolute correlation between their expression profiles exceeds threshold
MISC--: hard thresholding correlation leads simple network concepts but may lead loss information if been set there will no link between two genes if their correlation equals
MISC--: preserve continuous nature coexpression information one could simply define weighted adjacency matrix absolute value gene expression correlation matrix i e ij s ij
OWNX--: however since microarray data noisy number samples often small we others found useful emphasize strong correlations punish weak correlations
MISC--: natural define adjacency between two genes power absolute value correlation coefficient citation citation formulawith
MISC--: this soft thresholding approach leads weighted gene coexpression network
OWNX--: we present empirical results weighted unweighted networks main text text s text s text s
