MISC--: phylogenetic profiling based hypothesis during evolution functionally physically interacting genes likely inherited eliminated codependent manner
OWNX--: creating presence absence profiles orthologous genes now common powerful way identifying functionally associated genes
BASE--: this approach correctly determining orthology means identifying functional equivalence between two genes critical nontrivial step largely explains why previous work this area mainly focused using presence absence profiles prokaryotic species
OWNX--: here we demonstrate eukaryotic genomes high proportion multigene families whose phylogenetic profile distributions poor presence absence information content
MISC--: this feature makes them prone orthology mis assignment unsuited standard profile based prediction methods
OWNX--: using cath structural domain assignments gene d database complete eukaryotic genomes we developed novel modification phylogenetic profiling method uses genome copy number each domain superfamily predict functional relationships
OWNX--: our approach superfamilies subclustered at ten levels sequence identity percent percent phylogenetic profiles built at each level
MISC--: all profiles compared using normalised euclidean distances identify those correlated changes their domain copy number
OWNX--: we demonstrate two protein families will auto tune strong co evolutionary signals when their profiles compared at similarity levels capture their functional relationship
OWNX--: our method finds functional relationships not detectable conventional presence absence profile comparisons does not require priori any fixed criteria define orthologous genes
MISC--: comparison phylogenetic profiles orthologous proteins different species well known powerful method detecting functionally related proteins
OWNX--: approach assumes two functionally related proteins will been inherited eliminated codependent fashion through speciation
MISC--: therefore examining correlated presence absence patterns different genomes possible infer protein co evolution functional relationship
MISC--: after original idea was published citation phylogenetic profile method was improved reinterpreted many different ways
MISC--: example through application more complex logical rules associate compare protein profiles citation use domain profiles instead whole proteins citation refining algorithm citation integration species phylogenetic information citation citation
OWNX--: although phylogenetic profile method improved integrating new sources information all cases prediction quality this method depends two critical steps selection reference species sample determination proteins orthologues
MISC--: typically latter done using reciprocal best hits approach similarity determined blast algorithm citation citation citation e value cutoff potential orthologues
MISC--: fact two steps different impacts prediction quality
MISC--: reference species problem avoided simply increasing sample size new genomes until certain number been reached
MISC--: however there many problems e g citation citation determining orthology especially separation orthologues paralogues
MISC--: multigene families exist within one genome also exhibit functional overlap substitutability between members
MISC--: fact genes evolve at different rates due both uneven natural selection pressure their functions different species having different mutation rates e g rodents accumulate point mutations more rapidly than apes citation implies evolutionary rates proteins may vary over several orders magnitude different gene families citation
MISC--: this rate variation makes difficult choose single similarity e value cutoff broadly applied identify those orthologues most likely retained similar functionality
MISC--: multigene family problem particularly challenging eukaryotic genomes wherein percentage genes present multiple homologous copies much higher than prokaryotic genomes
CONT--: however higher percentage multigene families not only problem makes more difficult correctly assign orthologous relationships eukaryotic species
MISC--: contrast prokaryotes accurate identification orfs complicated eukaryotes noise domain rearrangements more complex gene architectures higher presence noncoding regions
MISC--: furthermore eukaryotes there weaker correlation between number orfs phenotypic complexity organism
MISC--: this probably due number reasons perhaps most significantly greater use rna based regulatory mechanisms citation
OWNX--: we developed novel modification phylogenetic profile method bypasses several problems especially orthology functional equivalence also perceived detection problem detect interacting multigene families
OWNX--: this method particularly applicable identifying functional networks eukaryotes so far proven intractable
MISC--: our approach based around protein domains since most elemental units protein function
OWNX--: furthermore this allows us bypass confusion caused domain rearrangements
OWNX--: this study we used domain annotation gene d database stores cath assignments complete genomes
OWNX--: first key modification we do not consider presence absence domains but number copies domain
OWNX--: second key modification we subcluster all domains at ten levels sequence identity percent percent
OWNX--: we then create profiles every domain family subclusters within enables identification distinct functional subgroups within domain families
BASE--: although clear there always exceptions any evolutionary model proposed co evolutionary hypothesis implicit our model supposes gene copy number two functionally related protein clusters will vary related fashion
OWNX--: our approach domain occurrence profiles built at many identity levels therefore expected two protein clusters will auto tune significant correlation signal when their profiles compared at similarity levels retain their functional relationship
OWNX--: therefore domain occurrence profiles were compared all against all identify correlations domain copy number variation all different identity levels
OWNX--: our method found strong co evolutionary signals amongst functionally related multigene domain families could not been predicted conventional presence absence comparison profiles proposed pellegrini et al citation
CONT--: this new approach number features make especially useful eukaryotic genome analysis
MISC--: firstly phylogenetic profiles based protein domains detect functional relationships not detectable using phylogenetic profiles whole proteins reducing noise protein domain rearrangements produce particularly eukaryotes citation
OWNX--: secondly uses domain occurrence profiles instead presence absence profiles
MISC--: latter less effective eukaryotic genomes they do not account wide variation gene copy number observed eukaryotes
MISC--: thirdly method applied does not require priori any fixed e value cutoff define orthologous groups
MISC--: because domain clusters built at several discrete identity levels method takes into account much variation uneven selection pressure produces sequence functional conservation
