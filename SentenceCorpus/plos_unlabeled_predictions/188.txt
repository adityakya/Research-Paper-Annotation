MISC--: ample evidence accumulated evolutionary importance duplication events
CONT--: however little known about ensuing step step divergence process selective conditions allow progress
AIMX--: here we present computational study divergence two repressors after duplication
OWNX--: central feature our approach intermediate phenotypes quantified through use vivo measured repression strengths escherichia coli lac mutants
OWNX--: evolutionary pathways constructed multiple rounds single base pair substitutions selection tight independent binding
OWNX--: our analysis indicates when duplicated repressor co diverges together its binding site fitness landscape allows funneling new regulatory interaction early increases fitness
OWNX--: we find neutral mutations do not play essential role important substantial divergence probabilities
OWNX--: varying selective pressure we pinpoint necessary ingredients observed divergence
MISC--: our findings underscore importance coevolutionary mechanisms regulatory networks should relevant evolution protein dna well protein protein interactions
MISC--: initially put forward stevens citation later advocated ohno his seminal work citation gene duplication followed functional divergence now seen general mechanism acquiring new functions citation
MISC--: also regulatory networks thought shaped significantly genetic duplication citation
MISC--: instance sequence analysis transcription factor families points various historical duplication events citation citation
MISC--: however very little known about subsequent mutational divergence pathways about corresponding stepwise phenotypical changes subject selection
MISC--: while issues not yet been explored experimentally related generic aspects mutational plasticity been addressed theoretically citation citation
MISC--: however central obstacle studying mutational pathways through computer simulations remains unknown relation between sequence binding affinity general rather abstract mapping assumed
OWNX--: describe formation new regulatory interaction after duplication event our current aim abstract approach would particularly speculative
MISC--: here we reason many characteristics adaptation real protein dna contacts hidden extensive body mutational data been accumulated over many years
OWNX--: measured repression values used fitness landscapes pathways explored computing consecutive rounds single base pair substitutions selection
AIMX--: here we develop this approach study divergence duplicate repressors their binding sites
OWNX--: more specifically we focus creation new unique protein dna recognition starting two identical repressors two identical operators
OWNX--: we consider selective conditions favor evolution toward independent regulation
MISC--: interestingly regulatory divergence inherently coevolutionary process where repressors operators must optimized coordinated fashion
OWNX--: mere presence selective pressure clearly not sufficient condition achieve new function
MISC--: rather evolutionary potential limitations seen governed shape actual fitness landscape evolutionary search within
OWNX--: studying intrinsic limitations divergence represents overall aim this work
MISC--: many open questions arise when considering formation new protein dna interaction may viewed construction new lock uniquely matching key
MISC--: instance how should protein modified step step recognize new dna binding site also does not yet exist vice versa
MISC--: one would expect complementary mutations need occur protein dna binding site
MISC--: does this mean temporary losses fitness must endured when taking single mutation steps
MISC--: how many mutations must minimally accumulate before noticeable new recognition obtained selection act
MISC--: latter important point mutations conferring selective advantage spread more readily through population citation resulting drastic increase divergence probability
OWNX--: questions addressed exhaustively searching landscape optimal pathways well complementary population dynamics simulations
MISC--: previously been shown lac repressor mutants indeed exist bind exclusively mutant lac operators citation
OWNX--: our simulations reveal duplicated repressor operator pair readily evolve achieve independence binding while monotonously increasing its fitness step step process
OWNX--: moreover simply following fittest mutants does predominantly guide system desired global optimum indicates funnel like features fitness landscape
AIMX--: detailed analysis subsequent network changes indicates generic sequence events we study underlying mechanisms varying applied selective pressure
OWNX--: next we show trajectories we find optimal pathway simulations not rare exceptions since similar trajectories followed using probabilistic scheme accepting mutation
OWNX--: results further suggest feasibility studying regulatory divergence laboratory evolution experiments finally we make comparison alternative models creation new regulatory interactions
