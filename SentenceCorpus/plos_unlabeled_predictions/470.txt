MISC--: many biological systems interactions describe coupling between different units genetic network nonlinear stochastic
OWNX--: we study interplay between stochasticity nonlinearity using responses chinese hamster ovary mammalian cells different temperature shocks
MISC--: experimental data show mean value response cell population described mathematical expression valid large range heat shock conditions
MISC--: nonlinear stochastic theoretical model was developed explains empirical law mean response
MISC--: moreover theoretical model predicts specific biological probability distribution responses cell population
OWNX--: prediction was experimentally confirmed measurements at single cell level
MISC--: computational approach used study other nonlinear stochastic biological phenomena
MISC--: complex biological systems built out huge number components
MISC--: components diverse dna sequence elements mrna transcription factors etc concentration each component changes over time
MISC--: one way understand functions complex biological system construct quantitative model interactions present system
MISC--: interactions usually nonlinear terms concentrations components participate interaction process
MISC--: example concentration dimer proportional product concentrations molecules dimerise
MISC--: besides being nonlinear interactions also stochastic
MISC--: production process molecule not deterministic governed probability rate production
MISC--: what follows nonlinear stochastic model response heat shocks cho mammalian cells will developed
MISC--: heat stress just one example many ways molecular system perturbed
MISC--: general perspective structure molecular system uncovered imposing different perturbations system under study then responses system measured
MISC--: experimental collection pairs input output signals laws describe system uncovered
MISC--: this fundamental idea systems synthetic biology citation citation long proved successful field electronics
MISC--: input signals applied through use signal generators citation citation
MISC--: input signal easy manipulate heat pulse parameters change being pulse temperature its duration
MISC--: members stress protein family heat shock protein highly responsive temperature variations
MISC--: this protein molecular chaperone critical component complex genetic network enables organism respond deleterious effects stress citation citation
MISC--: since hsp thus important regulator complex system our goal was find if possible develop mathematical model regulation its expression mammalian cells exposed heat shock
OWNX--: our specific objectives were determine equation representing average expression hsp over time cell population after initial heat shock determine how physical parameters heat shock influence parameters this equation determine mathematical model describes expression hsp at single cell level
OWNX--: we first describe process inferring mathematical model experimental data
MISC--: then mathematical study model will follow
