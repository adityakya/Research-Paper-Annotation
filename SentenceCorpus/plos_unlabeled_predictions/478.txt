OWNX--: we study how functional constraints bound shape evolution through analysis mammalian voltage gated sodium channels
MISC--: primary function sodium channels allow propagation action potentials
MISC--: since hodgkin huxley mathematical models suggested sodium channel properties need tightly constrained action potential propagate
MISC--: there nine mammalian genes encoding voltage gated sodium channels many more than percent identical sequence
MISC--: this sequence similarity presumably corresponds similarity function consistent idea properties must tightly constrained
MISC--: however multiplicity genes encoding sodium channels raises question why there so many
OWNX--: we demonstrate simplest theoretical constraints bounding sodium channel diversity requirements membrane excitability uniqueness resting potential act directly constraining sodium channel properties
OWNX--: we compare predicted constraints functional data mammalian sodium channel properties collected literature including different sets measurements publications wild type mutant under variety conditions
OWNX--: data all channel types including mutants obeys excitability constraint other hand channels expressed muscle tend obey constraint unique resting potential while channels expressed neuronal tissue do not
MISC--: excitability properties alone distinguish nine sodium channels into four different groups consistent phylogenetic analysis
OWNX--: our calculations suggest interpretations functional differences between groups
OWNX--: despite relatively small number genes human genome there many examples groups nearly identical genes perform similar functions
MISC--: diversity could either reflect redundancy evolutionary specialization citation citation
MISC--: specialization could result tuning different functional environments nearly identical genes might play very different functional roles citation

MISC--: our analysis demonstrates excitability properties alone distinguish nine sodium channels into four different groups
MISC--: within each group there strong positive correlation between voltage dependence activation inactivation
MISC--: members each four groups close according phylogenetic analysis citation citation citation
OWNX--: what functional differences between groups
OWNX--: two groups correspond channels expressed nerve muscle tissue respectively
MISC--: another group potential voltage threshold substantially higher than other channels
MISC--: final group only produce action potentials narrow conductance range even then maximum voltage threshold less than thermal fluctuations
MISC--: separation channels into functionally distinct groups suggests they evolved perform specialized tasks
