OWNX--: seminal paper w maddison proposed minimizing deep coalescences mdc optimization criterion inferring species tree set incongruent gene trees assuming incongruence exclusively due lineage sorting
AIMX--: subsequent paper maddison knowles provided implemented search heuristic optimizing mdc criterion given set gene trees
MISC--: however heuristic not guaranteed compute optimal solutions its hill climbing search makes slow practice
OWNX--: this paper we provide two exact solutions problem inferring species tree set gene trees under mdc criterion
OWNX--: other words our solutions guaranteed find tree minimizes total number deep coalescences set gene trees
OWNX--: one solution based novel integer linear programming formulation another based simple dynamic programming approach
MISC--: powerful ilp solvers cplex make first solution appealing particularly very large scale instances problem whereas dp based solution eliminates dependence proprietary tools its simplicity makes easy integrate other genomic events may cause gene tree incongruence
OWNX--: using exact solutions we analyze data set loci eight yeast species data set loci eight apicomplexan species several simulated data sets
OWNX--: we show mdc criterion provides very accurate estimates species tree topologies our solutions very fast thus allowing accurate analysis genome scale data sets
OWNX--: further efficiency solutions allow quick exploration sub optimal solutions important parsimony based criterion mdc we show
AIMX--: we show searching species tree compatibility graph clusters induced gene trees may sufficient practice finding helps ameliorate computational requirements optimization solutions
MISC--: further we study statistical consistency convergence rate mdc criterion well its optimality inferring species tree
OWNX--: finally we show how our solutions used identify potential horizontal gene transfer events may caused some incongruence data thus augmenting maddison s original framework
OWNX--: we implemented our solutions phylonet software package freely available at link
MISC--: accurate species trees model evolutionary histories sets species play central role comparative genomics conservation studies analyses population divergence among many other applications
MISC--: traditionally species tree inferred sequencing single locus group species its tree known gene tree reconstructed using method maximum likelihood this tree declared species tree
MISC--: underlying assumption obviously gene tree species tree identical hence reconstructing former amounts learning latter
CONT--: however biologists long recognized this assumption not necessarily always valid
MISC--: nevertheless due limitations sequencing technologies this approach remained standard method until very recently
OWNX--: advent whole genome sequencing complete genomes various organisms becoming increasingly available particularly important data multiple loci organisms becoming available
OWNX--: availability data allowed analyzing multiple loci various groups species
MISC--: analyses many cases uncovered widespread incongruence among gene trees same set organisms
OWNX--: therefore while reconstructing gene tree requires considering process nucleotide substitution reconstructing species tree requires addition considering process resulted incongruities among gene trees so species phylogeny inferred reconciling incongruities
OWNX--: this paper we address problem efficient inference accurate species trees multiple loci when gene trees assumed correct their incongruence assumed exclusively due lineage sorting
OWNX--: we also address integration horizontal gene transfer potential cause gene tree incongruence into framework
OWNX--: let us illustrate process lineage sorting way causes gene tree incongruence
MISC--: evolutionary perspective barring any recombination evolutionary history set genomes would depicted tree same tree models evolution each gene genomes
MISC--: however events recombination break linkage among different parts genome those unlinked parts may take different paths through phylogeny results gene trees differ species tree well each other due lineage sorting
MISC--: widespread gene tree incongruence due lineage sorting been shown recently several groups closely related organisms including yeast citation drosophila citation staphylococcus aureus citation apicomplexan citation
OWNX--: this case gene trees need reconciled within branches species tree shown figure
MISC--: few methods been introduced recently analyzing gene trees reconciling their incongruities inferring species trees despite incongruities
CONT--: generally speaking each methods follows one two approaches combined analysis approach separate analysis approach see figure
MISC--: combined analysis aproach sequences multiple loci concatenated resulting supergene data set analyzed using traditional phylogenetic methods maximum parsimony maximum likelihood e g citation
OWNX--: separate analysis approach sequence data each locus first analyzed individually reconciliation gene trees then sought
OWNX--: one way reconcile gene trees taking their majority consensus e g citation
MISC--: another democratic vote method entails taking tree topology occurring highest frequency among all gene trees species tree
MISC--: shortcomings methods based two approaches been analyzed various researchers citation citation
MISC--: recently bayesian methods following separate analysis approach been developed citation citation
MISC--: while methods firm statistical basis they very time consuming taking hours days even moderate size data sets limits their scalability
MISC--: citation maddison proposed parsimony based approach inferring species trees gene trees minimizing number extra lineages minimizing deep coalesces
MISC--: heuristic this approach was later described citation
MISC--: citation than et al provided two stage heuristic inferring species tree under mdc criterion
MISC--: however no exact solutions computing mdc criterion exist
OWNX--: this paper we provide formal definition notion extra lineages first described citation
OWNX--: we then present exact solutions integer linear programming algorithm dynamic programming algorithm finding optimal species tree topology set gene tree topologies under mdc criterion
OWNX--: our solutions based two central observations species tree maximal clique compatibility graph set species clusters quantifying amount incongruence between set gene trees species tree obtained simple counting lineages within branches species tree
OWNX--: accuracy computational efficiency solutions we demonstrate allow analysis genome scale data sets analysis large numbers data sets those involved simulation studies
MISC--: given mdc parsimonious explanation incongruence data imperative sub optimal solutions considered
OWNX--: computational efficiency our solutions allow rapid exploration sub optimal solutions
MISC--: last but not least exact solutions allow us empirically study properties mdc optimality criterion inferring species tree
OWNX--: we implemented both exact solutions phylonet software package citation
BASE--: we reanalyze apicomplexan data set citation yeast data set citation large number synthetic data sets species gene trees we simulated using mesquite tool citation
OWNX--: each data set our method computed species tree at most few seconds produced very accurate species trees we show
OWNX--: case apicomplexan data set we provide tree slightly different one proposed authors citation discuss this tree
MISC--: yeast data set we obtain tree identical one proposed authors citation well other studies citation
OWNX--: addition quality species trees efficiency our method inferred them one advantage our method used exploratory fashion screen multiple species tree candidates study reconciliation scenarios within branches each them
OWNX--: we illustrate utility this capability yeast apicomplexan data sets
OWNX--: further apicomplexan data set we illustrate how screen possible horizontal gene transfer events using reconciliation scenarios computed other methods
AIMX--: using synthetic data sets we study statistical consistency well convergence rate mdc criterion
MISC--: we also show may sufficient consider only set clusters induced gene trees practice may much smaller than set all clusters species thus achieving further reduction computation time
AIMX--: nonetheless we present example illustrate certain cases focusing only gene tree clusters may result sub optimal species tree under mdc
CONT--: computational efficiency our methods coupled promising properties mdc criterion makes our methods particularly applicable large genome scale data sets
