OWNX--: mature human brain organized into collection specialized functional networks flexibly interact support various cognitive functions
MISC--: studies development often attempt identify organizing principles guide maturation functional networks
MISC--: this report we combine resting state functional connectivity mri graph analysis community detection spring embedding visualization techniques analyze four separate networks defined earlier studies
OWNX--: we previously reported we find across development trend toward segregation between regions close anatomical space integration between selected regions distant space
MISC--: generalization earlier trends across multiple networks suggests this general developmental principle changes functional connectivity would extend large scale graph theoretic analyses large scale brain networks
MISC--: communities children predominantly arranged anatomical proximity while communities adults predominantly reflect functional relationships defined adult fmri studies
MISC--: sum over development organization multiple functional networks shifts local anatomical emphasis children more distributed architecture young adults
OWNX--: we argue this local distributed developmental characterization important implications understanding development neural systems underlying cognition
OWNX--: further graph metrics similar child adult graphs both showing small world like properties while community detection modularity optimization reveals stable communities within graphs clearly different between young children young adults
MISC--: observations suggest early school age children adults both relatively efficient systems may solve similar information processing problems divergent ways
MISC--: mature human brain both structurally functionally specialized discrete areas cerebral cortex perform distinct types information processing
OWNX--: areas organized into functional networks flexibly interact support various cognitive functions
MISC--: studies development often attempt identify organizing principles guide maturation functional networks

MISC--: major portion work investigating nature functional human brain development based results functional magnetic resonance imaging studies
MISC--: examining differences fmri activation profile particular brain region between children adolescents adults developmental trajectory region s involvement cognitive task outlined citation citation citation citation
OWNX--: experiments been crucial our current understanding typical atypical brain development
OWNX--: addition fmri activation studies relatively new increasingly utilized method resting state functional connectivity mri allows complementary examination functional relationships between regions across development
OWNX--: resting state fcmri based discovery spontaneous low frequency blood oxygen level dependent signal fluctuations sometimes distant but functionally related grey matter regions show strong correlations at rest citation
MISC--: low frequency bold fluctuations appear relate spontaneous neural activity citation citation
MISC--: effect rs fcmri evaluates regional interactions occur when subject not performing explicit task citation citation citation citation
MISC--: date rs fcmri been used several domains examine systems level organization motor citation memory citation citation attention citation task control systems citation citation citation
MISC--: addition because rs fcmri does not require active engagement behavioral task unburdens experimental design subject compliance training demands
MISC--: thus rs fcmri becoming frequently used tool examining changes network structure disease citation citation aging citation citation across development citation citation citation
OWNX--: previous work regarding task level control adults we applied rs fcmri set regions derived fmri meta analysis included studies control demanding tasks
MISC--: this analysis revealed brain regions exhibiting different combinations control signals across many tasks grouped into distinct fronto parietal cingulo opercular functional networks citation citation
MISC--: based functional activation profiles regions characterized previous fmri study fronto parietal network appears act shorter timescale initiating adjusting top down control
MISC--: contrast cingulo opercular network operates longer timescale providing set initiation stable set maintenance duration task blocks citation
MISC--: along two task control networks citation citation set cerebellar regions showing error related activity across tasks citation formed separate cerebellar network
MISC--: adults cerebellar network functionally connected both fronto parietal cingulo opercular networks citation citation
MISC--: functional connections may represent pathways involved task level control provide feedback information both control networks citation citation
MISC--: another functional network one most prominent sets regions examined rs fcmri default mode network
MISC--: default mode network was first characterized consistent decrease activity during goal directed tasks compared baseline citation citation
MISC--: resting state fcmri analyses repeatedly shown regions along associated medial temporal regions correlated at rest adults citation citation citation citation
MISC--: while distinct function default mode network often linked internally directed mental activity citation this notion continues debated citation citation citation citation
