MISC--: relationship between apolipoprotein e aggregation processes amyloid peptide been shown crucial alzheimer s disease
MISC--: presence apoe isoform considered contributing risk factor ad
OWNX--: however detailed molecular properties apoe interacting peptide unknown although various mechanisms been proposed explain physiological pathological role this relationship
OWNX--: here computer simulations been used investigate process interaction n terminal domain human apoe isoforms
OWNX--: molecular docking combined molecular dynamics simulations been undertaken determine peptide binding sites relative stability binding each apoe isoforms
OWNX--: our results show several apoe isoforms investigated only apoe presents misfolded intermediate when bound moreover initial helix used peptide model structure also becomes unstructured due interaction apoe
AIMX--: structural changes appear related rearrangement salt bridge network apoe we propose model
MISC--: seems plausible apoe its partially unfolded state incapable performing clearance thereby promoting amyloid forming processes
OWNX--: hence proposed model used identify potential drug binding sites apoe complex where interaction between two molecules inhibited
MISC--: alzheimer s disease one most common neurodegenerative diseases at present time
MISC--: disease characterized formation neurofibrillary tangles plaques brain leading neuronal dysfunction neuronal loss finally death
MISC--: main component plaques amyloid peptide amino acids long hydrophobic peptide generated cleavage amyloid precursor accumulates form soluble non soluble aggregates
MISC--: connection between apolipoprotein e ad well established citation citation
MISC--: structurally apoe residues protein n terminal domain involved binding heparin low density lipoprotein receptors ldlr related proteins citation citation
MISC--: c terminal domain been related heparin lipid binding citation citation
MISC--: three main isoforms been described human apoe i e apoe apoe apoe
MISC--: standard variant apoe while apoe defective receptor binding causing apoe homozygotic individuals higher predisposition diseases related high amounts cholesterol triglycerides citation citation
MISC--: apoe receptor binding affinity remains unaffected but apoe homozygotic individuals higher risk coronary heart disease significantly greater risk developing ad
MISC--: citation citation around percent all ad cases related genetic variance at apoe locus citation citation
MISC--: only difference between apoe isoforms found residues where cys cys corresponds apoe cys arg apoe arg arg apoe
MISC--: presence cysteines at positions confers oligomerization properties apoe
MISC--: indeed apoe apoe able form disulfide linked homo hetero oligomers due presence respectively two one cys residue
MISC--: apoe lacks possibility strong disulfide linking however unclear whether weaker interactions could promote oligomerization apoe
MISC--: cys arg substitution apoe also molecular impact terms intra protein polar contacts orientation arg different apoe compared apoe orientation arg towards c terminal domain facilitates salt bridge between arg glu
OWNX--: electrostatic interaction between arg glu promotes n c domain interaction packs structure tighter seems crucial interaction apoe triglyceride rich lipoproteins
MISC--: interaction between arg glu absent apoe leading more open structure preferential binding phospholipid rich high density lipoproteins citation citation
MISC--: chemical thermal denaturation experiments shown most unstable structure belongs apoe displays partially unfolded intermediate containing some structure may related fact apoe enhances deposition citation citation
OWNX--: although different mechanisms been proposed explain physiological pathological relationship between apoe peptide details interaction between apoe at molecular level unknown
OWNX--: detailed knowledge however important understanding pathological mechanisms ad may also help identify potential therapeutic target sites where interaction between apoe blocked
OWNX--: present study we using molecular docking simulations based global minimum energy investigate interaction process n terminal domain different apoe isoforms order determine potential peptide binding sites apoe
OWNX--: next step molecular dynamics calculations undertaken explore conformational dynamics apoe under interaction evaluate stability each apoe complexes
OWNX--: analysis statistics electrostatic interactions three apoe isoforms we present model explaining role apoe interaction its relevance ad
