MISC--: cells wing blade drosophila melanogaster exhibit plane polarization causing distal orientation hairs
MISC--: establishment planar cell polarity involves intercellular interactions well global orienting signal
OWNX--: many genetic molecular components underlying this process been experimentally identified recently advanced system level model suggested observed mutant phenotypes understood terms intercellular interactions involving asymmetric localization membrane bound proteins
MISC--: among key open questions understanding emergence ordered polarization effect stochasticity role global orienting signal
OWNX--: issues relate closely our understanding ferromagnetism physical systems
OWNX--: here we pursue this analogy understand emergence pcp order
OWNX--: this end we develop semi phenomenological representation underlying molecular processes define phase diagram model provides global view dependence phenotype parameters
OWNX--: we show dynamics pcp two regimes rapid growth amplitude local polarization followed slower process alignment progresses small large scales
OWNX--: we discuss response tissue various types orienting signals show global pcp order achieved weak orienting signal provided acts during early phase process
OWNX--: finally we define discuss some experimental predictions model
MISC--: epithelia diverse tissues addition their apico basal polarization acquire polarization within two dimensional layer cells phenomenon called planar cell polarity citation citation
OWNX--: developing wing drosophila pcp determines growth direction small hairs extend radially cell boundaries
MISC--: wild type wing where cells approximately hexagonal form regular honeycomb lattice all hairs point distal direction
MISC--: series recent experiments show several key proteins citation including transmembrane proteins frizzled van gogh cytosolic proteins dishevelled prickled localize asymmetrically cell boundaries citation citation defining direction plane within each cell forming characteristic zig zag pattern protein localization lattice
OWNX--: other experiments show local pcp orientation depends inter cellular signaling
MISC--: first mutant clones fz vang activity suppressed amplified cause characteristic reproducible inversion polarity large patches cells proximal distal clone citation
MISC--: observations summarized figs
MISC--: c d second fat mutant clones citation citation hairs do not all point correctly distal direction yet their orientation strongly correlated between nearby cells varies gradually across tissue creating characteristic swirling pattern
MISC--: thus experimental evidence suggests interaction between neighboring cells tends locally align their polarity citation citation citation
MISC--: this local polarity need not point distally unless addition there global orienting signal picks out distal direction throughout wing
MISC--: yet aside clear involvement protocadherin fat citation citation molecular details this pathway remains now unknown
MISC--: swirling patterns fat mutants citation recent evidence citation citation suggest orienting field related presence gradient fat four jointed dachs pathway
MISC--: observations evoke analogy between pcp behavior ferromagnets extensively studied physics well understood terms statistical mechanics relatively simple models citation
MISC--: models each atomic site assigned magnetic dipole spin assume different orientation
OWNX--: salient properties ferromagnets arise opposing influence interaction between neighboring spins tends co align their orientation influence thermal fluctuations tend randomize spin direction
OWNX--: ferromagnets typically exhibit two phases behavior high temperature phase where spins disordered low temperature ferromagnetic phase where interactions dominate over thermal fluctuations leading spontaneous polarization arbitrary direction
MISC--: this state even small external magnetic field big effect magnetic polarization spontaneous polarization aligns itself external field yet dynamics leading global alignment quite slow
MISC--: essential lesson statistical mechanics ordered disordered states exist broad class models discussed general context focusing classification different regimes function few parameters
OWNX--: we follow this lesson focusing study competition between intercellular interaction disordering influence fluctuations introduced noisy molecular interactions
OWNX--: statistical mechanics we define phase diagram identifies different regimes behavior space most relevant parameters

OWNX--: instead fixing particular set parameters fitting data we explore generic behavior model function parameters defining quantitative features characteristic different phases
OWNX--: formulating model we identify several essential ingredients required obtain characteristic zig zag pattern non autonomy fz vang mutant clones
OWNX--: we expect our simplified model capture important properties pcp although does not incorporate all molecular details
