MISC--: genome wide association studies test association between common genetic markers disease phenotype shown varying degrees success
MISC--: while many factors could potentially confound gwa studies we focus possibility multiple rare variants may act concert influence disease etiology
OWNX--: here we describe algorithm rv analysis rarecover
OWNX--: algorithm combines disparate collection rvs low effect modest penetrance
MISC--: further does not require rare variants adjacent location
BASE--: extensive simulations over range assumed penetrance population attributable risk values illustrate power our approach over other published methods including collapsing weighted collapsing strategies
OWNX--: showcase method we apply rarecover re sequencing data cohort individuals at extremes body mass index distribution
OWNX--: individual samples were re sequenced at two genes faah mgll known involved endocannabinoid metabolism
MISC--: rarecover analysis identifies exactly one significantly associated region each gene each about kbp upstream regulatory regions
MISC--: data suggests rvs help disrupt expression two genes leading lowered metabolism corresponding cannabinoids
OWNX--: overall our results point power including rvs measuring genetic associations
MISC--: common disease common variant hypothesis citation citation postulates etiology common diseases mediated commonly occurring genomic variants population
MISC--: this served basis genome wide association studies test association between individual genomic markers disease phenotype
MISC--: using genome wide panels common snps gwa studies been successful identifying hundreds statistically significant associations many common diseases well several quantitative traits citation citation
MISC--: nevertheless success gwa studies been mixed
MISC--: significant genetic loci not been detected several common diseases known strong genetic component citation
MISC--: additionally many common diseases associations discovered gwa studies account only small fraction heritability disease
MISC--: while many factors could potentially confound gwa studies we focus possibility multiple rare variants may act concert influence disease etiology
MISC--: alternative cdcv hypothesis common disease rare variant hypothesis been topic much recent debate citation shown promise explaining disease etiology multiple studies
MISC--: example rare variants been implicated reduced sterol absorption consequently lower plasma levels ldl citation citation colorectal cancer citation
OWNX--: while some studies shown rvs increase risk recent study indicates rvs also act protectively multiple rvs renal salt handling genes showing association reduced renal salt resorption reduced risk hypertension citation
MISC--: additionally rare mutations ifih been shown act protectively against type diabetes citation
MISC--: aforementioned studies others focused re sequencing coding regions candidate genes using sanger sequencing
MISC--: recent technological advances dna sequencing made possible re sequence large stretches genome cost effective manner
MISC--: this enabling large scale studies impact rvs complex diseases
CONT--: however several properties rare variants make their genetic effects difficult detect current approaches
MISC--: bodmer bonilla provide excellent review properties rvs differences between rare common variant analysis citation
MISC--: example if causal variant rare disease common then allele s population attributable risk consequently odds ratio will low
MISC--: additionally even highly penetrant rvs unlikely linkage disequilibrium more common genetic variations might genotyped association study common disease
MISC--: therefore single marker tests association exploit ld based associations likely low power
MISC--: if cdrv hypothesis holds combination multiple rvs must contribute population risk
MISC--: this case there challenge detecting multi allelic association between locus disease
MISC--: methods detect associations only just being developed
OWNX--: natural approach collapsing strategy where multiple rvs at locus collapsed into single variant
MISC--: strategies low power when causal neutral rvs combined
MISC--: madsen browning recently proposed weighted sum statistic detect loci disease individuals enriched rare variants citation
MISC--: their approach variants weighted according their frequency unaffected sample low frequency variants being weighted more heavily
MISC--: each individual scored sum weights mutations carried
MISC--: test then determines if diseased individuals weighted more heavily than expected null model
MISC--: madsen browning show formula variants group being causal combined odds ratio formula weighted sum statistic detects associations high power
OWNX--: while effective this approach depends upon inclusion high proportion causal rare variants formation test statistics strong penetrance detect significant association
MISC--: their simulations par locus partitioned equally among all variants assumption may not always hold
MISC--: combined multivariate collapsing method proposed li leal combines variants into groups based upon predefined criteria citation
MISC--: individual group if any variant group carried otherwise
MISC--: cmc approach then considers each groups multivariate analysis explain disease risk
OWNX--: this combination collapsing approach multivariate analysis results increase power over single marker multiple marker approaches
OWNX--: however li leal point out method relies correct grouping variants
MISC--: power reduced functional variants excluded non functional variants included group
MISC--: assignment snps incorrect groups may fact decrease power below attainable through single marker analysis
MISC--: indeed recent analysis manolio colleagues suggests new methods might needed when causal variants both low par low penetrance values citation
OWNX--: here we focus model free method rarecover collapses only subset variants at locus
MISC--: informally consider locus formula encoding set formula rare variants
MISC--: rarecover associates formula phenotype measuring strongest possible association formed collapsing any subset formula variants at formula
OWNX--: at first glance approach many problems
OWNX--: first selecting optimal subset snps computationally intensive scaling formula
OWNX--: we show greedy approach selecting optimal subset scales linearly making feasible conduct associations large set candidate loci
MISC--: second confounding factor large number different tests at locus increase likelihood false association
OWNX--: adjustment required control type i error could decrease power method
CONT--: however extensive simulations show otherwise
OWNX--: our results suggest moderately penetrant alleles formula small par formula moderately sized cohorts sufficient rarecover detect significant association
MISC--: this compares well current power single marker gwa studies common variants outperforms other methods rv detection
OWNX--: we also applied rarecover analysis two genes faah mgll endocannabinoid pathway large sequencing study obese non obese individuals
MISC--: endocannabinoid pathway important mediator variety neurological functions citation citation
MISC--: endocannabinoids acting upon cb receptors brain gastrointestinal tract variety other tissues been shown influence food intake weight gain animal models obesity
MISC--: using selective endocannabinoid receptor antagonist sr leads reduced food intake mice
MISC--: correspondingly elevation leptin levels been shown decrease concentrations endogenous cb agonists anandamide ag mice thereby reducing food intake citation
MISC--: faah mgll enzymes serve regulators endocannabinoid signaling brain citation catalyzing hydrolysis endocannabinoid including anandamide ag
MISC--: gene expression studies lean obese women show significantly decreased levels aea ag well over expression cb faah lean opposed obese women citation
MISC--: while evidence points genetic association loci obesity multiple recent studies using common snps faah region failed confirm association citation citation
MISC--: pro thr polymorphism was tentatively associated obesity cohort europe asian ancestry but not been replicated other data citation
OWNX--: we tested hypothesis multiple rare alleles at loci associated obesity
OWNX--: we used unpublished data frazer colleagues where faah mgll regions were re sequenced using next generation technologies obese non obese individuals taken extremes body mass index distribution subjects large clinical trial
MISC--: resequencing identified number common rare variants region
OWNX--: we applied rarecover determine if multiple rvs i e allelic heterogeneity mediated genetic effects faah mgll obesity
MISC--: rarecover identified single region at each locus permutation adjusted p values formula formula
OWNX--: each case significant locus was immediately upstream gene consistent regulatory function rare variants
