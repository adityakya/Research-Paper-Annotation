MISC--: this article presents several studies replicate extend previous research maximizing
MISC--: modified scale measuring individual maximizing tendency introduced
MISC--: scale adequate psychometric properties reflects maximizers aspirations high standards their preference extensive alternative search but not decision difficulty aspect included several previous studies
OWNX--: based this scale maximizing positively correlated optimism need cognition desire consistency risk aversion intrinsic motivation self efficacy perceived workload whereas association regret inconsistent
MISC--: analysis correlates difficulty dimension suggests decision difficulty should conceptualized separate dimension rather than sub dimension maximizing
MISC--: opportunities future research suggested
MISC--: distinction between maximizing satisficing approaches decision making long been considered important decision making literature citation
MISC--: when maximizing decision makers hope find best possible solution systematically comparing available alternatives based well defined preferences
MISC--: when satisficing contrast decision makers aspire find solution meets important minimum requirements aspirations i e option good enough rather than best
MISC--: schwartz et al citation attracted considerable attention interest when proposing individuals differ their global disposition maximize versus satisfice decision making
MISC--: new maximizing scale was claimed adequately measure individual maximizing tendency was presented
MISC--: based analysis correlates this scale maximizers seemed less happy life less optimistic possess lower self esteem
MISC--: maximizers also appeared more prone depression perfectionism regret well more inclined engage upward social comparison than satisficers
MISC--: accordingly schwartz citation argued maximizing represents recipe unhappiness due overly high expectations self fulfilling fears regret
OWNX--: increased opportunities choice were also claimed represent particular burden maximizers who would feel compelled explore all possible opportunities find increasingly difficult make choice
MISC--: this line reasoning corresponds schwartz s citation previous research problems related increased choice possible tyranny freedom schwartz citation recommended decision makers should make efforts learn accept good enough rather than searching elusive best well stop worrying about what they missing
MISC--: subsequent research replicated several key results schwartz et al s citation studies identified other negative correlates
MISC--: example findings parker bruine de bruin fischoff citation suggest maximizing associated worse life outcomes less behavioral coping greater dependence others more decision avoidance
MISC--: parker et al citation argued if relationships causal then importance teach normative decision making skills well stress benefits satisficing order obtain better outcomes
MISC--: inspired research opportunities associated schwartz et al s citation maximizing scale well prospects offering practical advice decision makers scale was introduced several groups graduate students business administration norway
OWNX--: some groups responded original english version scale while other groups rated items pilot version norwegian based preliminary translations items
MISC--: surprisingly hardly any subjects seemed maximizers based their scores original maximizing scale regardless whether scale was presented original english version pilot version norwegian
MISC--: all but very few subjects reported satisficing approaches most tasks depicted items scale
MISC--: yet based discussions schwartz et al s citation theoretical underpinnings many subjects reported they indeed considered themselves maximizers
MISC--: however many items scale were seen too commonplace too inconsequential set off maximizing efforts
MISC--: subjects also argued many items referred situations were irrelevant them
MISC--: this feedback indicated many items scale not sufficiently general terms item content simultaneously not sufficiently relevant measure differences individual maximizing tendency across samples settings cultures
MISC--: limitations construct validity scale also been stressed diab gillespie highhouse citation among others
MISC--: diab et al citation argued uni dimensionality internal consistency important characteristics maximization attribute all thirteen items scale should load onto one factor
CONT--: however schwartz et al s citation scale comprises three distinct sub dimensions several items produce relatively weak inconsistent factor loadings
MISC--: accordingly there been debate literature concerning validity construct factor structure reliability scale well proposed correlates indicating maximizers less happy than satisficers
MISC--: diab et al citation asserted findings indicating maximizers less happy than satisficers need interpreted light inadequate definition measurement core construct
MISC--: based definition individual maximizing tendency general tendency pursue identification optimal alternative diab et al citation presented several alternative measures
MISC--: hypothesized schwartz et al s citation maximizing scale produced significantly higher correlations maladaptive personality traits dysfunctional decision making behaviors regret indecisiveness avoidance neuroticism life satisfaction than several diab et al s citation alternative measures including their nine item scale
MISC--: nenkov morrin ward schwartz hulland citation also addressed factor structure reliability validity schwartz et al s citation maximizing scale several short forms scale were tested using datasets different populations
MISC--: results replicated three factor solution schwartz et al citation
MISC--: nenkov et al citation interpreted first dimension reflect preference extensive alternative search i e desire continue seeking even better options
MISC--: second dimension was interpreted reflect decision difficulty i e decision makers perceived difficulty choosing making decisions
MISC--: third dimension was taken represent decision makers tendency hold high standards themselves their surroundings
MISC--: nenkov et al citation argued along same lines diab et al citation stressing need uni dimensionality internal consistency measurements maximizing construct
MISC--: however although several short versions schwartz et al s citation scale appeared equally useful when analyzing correlates three sub dimensions varied their correlation other variables
MISC--: nenkov et al citation therefore argued three dimensions should examined separately future research there need resolve whether all perhaps only one two three sub dimensions represent inherent components maximizing construct
MISC--: research reported diab et al citation nenkov et al citation suggests measurement individual maximizing tendency associated several fundamental methodological problems need resolved order advance research this area
MISC--: view interest schwartz et al s citation seminal article relatively few studies report empirical findings based original scale refined versions scale so far
MISC--: important exceptions include carrillat edmondson ladik s citation study customer loyalty iyengar wells schwartz s citation investigation job search strategies bruine de bruin parker fischoff s citation investigation individual differences decision making competence parker bruine de bruin fischoff s citation exploration decision making styles competence outcomes chowdhury ratneshwar mohanty s citation investigation maximizing versus satisficing consumers lewer gerlich gretz citation analysis determinants maximizing consumer purchase
MISC--: ambition studies reported here was threefold
MISC--: first purpose derives lack success when introducing schwartz et al s citation scale new population was contribute improving measurement scale testing original new items across several new large samples
MISC--: second purpose was replicate extend previous studies correlates individual maximizing tendency
MISC--: improved insight into correlates may shed better light maximizers personality traits driving forces behind efforts maximize decision making
OWNX--: instrument development testing across subjects settings important practical well theoretical methodological reasons
MISC--: reliable scale adequate factor structure discriminate validity would facilitate future research maximizing citation
OWNX--: efforts develop adequate scale may also improve our understanding core construct aid development clearer definition better nomological net
MISC--: attention attracted schwartz et al s citation research also demonstrates reliable scale high interest high potential value decision makers who wish reflect improve their decision making
