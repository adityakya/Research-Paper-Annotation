OWNX--: we asked whether people make their confidence judgments more realistic accurate adjusting them aim improving relationship between level confidence correctness answer
MISC--: this adjustment considered include so called second order metacognitive judgment
OWNX--: participants first gave confidence judgments about their answers questions about video clip they had just watched
MISC--: next they attempted increase their accuracy identifying confidence judgments need adjustment then modifying them
OWNX--: participants managed increase their metacognitive realism thus decreasing their absolute bias improving their calibration although effects were small
OWNX--: we also examined relationship between confidence judgments were adjusted retrieval fluency phenomenological memory quality participants experienced when first answering questions this quality was one either remember associated concrete vivid details know associated feeling familiarity
OWNX--: confidence judgments associated low retrieval fluency memory quality knowing were modified more often
OWNX--: brief our results provide evidence people improve realism their confidence judgments mainly decreasing their confidence incorrect answers
MISC--: thus this study supports conclusion people perform successful second order metacognitive judgments
MISC--: realistic confidence judgments about retrieved memories important number contexts e g medical legal contexts
OWNX--: example eyewitness crime must judge his her level confidence about correctly having identified criminal
MISC--: although many witnesses may feel confident about their identification relation between identification confidence correctness identification weak citation
MISC--: spite this weakness research also shown jurors often judge eyewitness credibility based level confidence eyewitness expresses citation
MISC--: thus level confidence about memory report should accurate possible relative correctness report citation
MISC--: general realism confidence judgments pertains how well person s confidence memory report matches correctness report citation
OWNX--: concept confidence realism includes two aspects calibration relationship between level confidence judgments probability answer being correct discrimination extent respondent discriminate between correct incorrect answers means their confidence judgments
OWNX--: this study we attended only participants ability improve calibration
MISC--: numerous studies reported people often show overconfidence e g they more confident than their memory report correct
MISC--: this case both general knowledge questions citation event memory questions citation although basis this so called overconfidence effect been widely debated citation
MISC--: given people show lack realism their confidence judgments many contexts finding ways help people improve realism their confidence judgments important
OWNX--: our first aim was investigate whether individuals increase realism their confidence judgments memory reports adjusting confidence judgments they believe most unrealistic
OWNX--: task improving realism confidence judgment designated here adjustment task involves first identifying confidence judgments adjust then modifying them
MISC--: when trying improve realism confidence judgments people presumably rely various types cues
OWNX--: our second aim was investigate potential usefulness two cues identifying confidence judgments need adjustment modifying them retrieval fluency subjective feeling ease recall phenomenological quality retrieved memories either remember associated concrete vivid detail know associated feeling familiarity
