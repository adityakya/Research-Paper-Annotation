MISC--: our previous research suggests people reporting stronger desire maximize obtain worse life outcomes citation
AIMX--: here we examine whether this finding may explained decision making styles self reported maximizers
MISC--: expanding schwartz et al citation we find self reported maximizers more likely show problematic decision making styles evidenced self reports less behavioral coping greater dependence others when making decisions more avoidance decision making greater tendency experience regret
MISC--: contrary predictions self reported maximizers were more likely report spontaneous decision making
MISC--: however relationship between self reported maximizing worse life outcomes largely unaffected controls measures other decision making styles decision making competence demographic variables
MISC--: behavioral decision research citation characterizes behavior terms its consistency axioms utility maximization citation
MISC--: half century research revealed both consistency departures norm citation
MISC--: latter include satisficing choosing alternative good enough rather than maximizing selecting option highest expected utility citation
MISC--: strategies beneficialif they save enough cognitive effort justify any loss expected payoff citation
MISC--: historically decision making research focused general processes underlying deviations normative theory satisficing instead maximizing citation
MISC--: more recently attention turned individual differences decision making citation asking whether through preference ability individuals make decisions consistent ways across tasks situations citation
MISC--: individual differences been examined include risk aversion risk judgments citation preference rational intuitive dependent avoidant spontaneous decision making styles citation decision making competence citation
MISC--: building simon s work schwartz et al citation developed scale measuring degree individuals report trying maximize rather than satisfice
MISC--: includes items when i watch tv i channel surf often scanning through options even while attempting watch one program
MISC--: other items capture ways one might explore much information possible when making choice
MISC--: given many options often available modern life e g tv channels cars jobs prospective mates maximizing no small feat citation
MISC--: perhaps because challenges successfully implementing maximizing strategy people who attempt do so fare less well life sense experiencing less happiness optimism self esteem life satisfaction while incurring more depression perfectionism regret citation
MISC--: moreover individuals who try maximize may less constructive decision making styles citation
OWNX--: example aspiring maximizers make more upward social comparisons thereby inducing regret counterfactual thinking about what might been
MISC--: they rely more external information sources citation might lead them further question their choices
MISC--: thus decision making styles may undermine very satisfaction attempted maximizers try so hard achieve citation
MISC--: even when maximizing pays off better outcomes satisfaction those outcomes still may not follow
MISC--: iyengar wells schwartz citation found recent college graduates who described themselves maximizers secured jobs number percent higher starting salaries but felt less satisfied during job search afterward
OWNX--: one possible explanation attempting maximize encourages focusing one easily compared feature salary while neglecting other features important job satisfaction
MISC--: were case then those who attempt maximize may make poorer decisions despite strongly desiring opposite
MISC--: conversely decisions lack easily compared criteria would maximizers may face cognitively intractable situations like those led simon propose advisability satisficing
MISC--: consistent hypotheses bruine de bruin et al citation found people higher self ratings schwartz et al s citation maximizing scale had lower scores measure decision making competence dmc described below r number p less than number
MISC--: addition self identified maximizers also reported worse outcomes decision outcome inventory doi includes number negative life events might reflect poor decision making
MISC--: events range broadly their impacts frequency include ruining clothes laundry having check bounce having mortgage loan foreclosed being jail overnight having been diagnosed type number diabetes more likely among people who made poor lifestyle choices
MISC--: analyses bruine de bruin et al citation focused developing validating dmc doi measures
MISC--: context schwartz et al s citation self reported maximization scale was one several comparison measures
AIMX--: result paper reported zero order correlations maximizing dmc doi but not other decision making styles demographic characteristics
MISC--: particular analyses did not examine extent lower dmc scores problematic decision making styles account correlation between self reported maximizing poorer life outcomes
MISC--: here we examine this question using bruine de bruin et al s citation diverse community sample rich dataset
OWNX--: we begin asking whether self reported maximizers tend report several decision making styles
MISC--: one measure behavioral coping taking action resolve difficult tasks rather than working around them citation
MISC--: because self reported maximizers may set unattainable goals they should report less coping
MISC--: five other measures come scott bruce s citation suite decision making style scales
MISC--: self reported maximizers should report engaging number more rational decision making reflecting their perception systematic deliberation about their choices number less intuitive decision making attempting avoid relying feelings instincts citation number more dependence others reflecting interpersonal comparisons quest information number more avoidant decision making postponing decisions search more information ponder possibilities number less spontaneous decision making sense taking more time carefully decide
MISC--: finally we expect self reported maximizers report greater regret about their past decisions replicating schwartz et al s citation finding diverse community sample
AIMX--: subsequently we take advantage diversity bruine de bruin et al s sample examine how self reported maximizing varies socio demographic variables
OWNX--: finally we examine whether correlations between self reported maximizing two performance measures dmc doi reduced after controlling other styles demographics
