MISC--: this paper compares behavior individuals playing classic two person deterministic prisoner s dilemma pd game choice data obtained repeated interdependent security prisoner s dilemma games varying probabilities loss ability learn not learn about actions one s counterpart area recent interest experimental economics
MISC--: this novel data set series controlled laboratory experiments analyzed using bayesian hierarchical methods first application methods this research domain
MISC--: we find individuals much more likely cooperative when payoffs deterministic than when outcomes probabilistic
OWNX--: key factor explaining this difference subjects stochastic pd game respond not just what their counterparts did but also whether not they suffered loss
MISC--: findings interpreted context behavioral theories commitment altruism reciprocity
MISC--: work provides linkage between bayesian statistics experimental economics consumer psychology
MISC--: interdependent security ids games social multi player games stochastic payoffs where each player must decide whether not mitigate her own risks
MISC--: more specifically each player knows even if she fully protects herself investing risk reducing measure she may still subject indirect losses being contaminated one other players who chose not invest
MISC--: heal kunreuther citation shown there wide variety significant current problems fit into ids framework ranging investing airline port security protecting oneself against disease through vaccinations individual users incurring software security costs when connected network divisions firms undertaking risky investments could cause entire firm become insolvent bankrupt current financial crisis
MISC--: kunreuther heal citation shown ids games either multiple nash equilibria just single nash equilibrium
MISC--: nash equilibrium both players strategies best response each other s strategies citation
OWNX--: this paper presents results analysis controlled laboratory experiments involving two players ids game where there single nash equilibrium
MISC--: if both players invest risk reducing measure there no chance either will suffer loss
MISC--: however if either both players do not invest protective measure then there some likelihood hence stochastic part both individuals will suffer loss
OWNX--: furthermore dominant strategy both players if they risk neutral i e neither risk averse nor risk seeking not invest protective measure despite fact had they taken this step their expected values would been higher than if they had not
MISC--: this ids game viewed stochastic prisoner s dilemma spd game area increased interest experimental economics citation
MISC--: standard deterministic prisoner s dilemma game two prisoners face dilemma testifying prosecution against each other admitting their own crime remaining silent nash equilibrium strategy each prisoner testify against each other even though both would better off if they agreed cooperate each other remaining silent
OWNX--: ids game investing risk mitigating measure analogous cooperating classic prisoner s dilemma game
MISC--: our experiment subjects were assigned play one three types prisoner s dilemma games i standard deterministic prisoner s game ii full feedback stochastic prisoner s dilemma game based ids model where players receive feedback about their counterparts actions payoffs each round iii partial feedback stochastic prisoner s dilemma game where players receive feedback only about their counterparts payoffs but not their actions
OWNX--: subjects were randomly paired play ten prisoner s dilemma games their assigned type against each other this called repeated prisoner s dilemma game supergame
MISC--: deterministic prisoner s dilemma game there considerable evidence controlled experiments if players play repeated prisoner s dilemma games against each other i e supergame cooperation emerge even though they would likely defect single period game citation
MISC--: each subject our experiment played multiple number number supergames same type i e deterministic stochastic full feedback stochastic partial feedback randomly chosen counterparts
OWNX--: more details our experimental design provided section number
OWNX--: our interest this research area both substantive methodological
OWNX--: substantive perspective we would like compare behavior individuals standard deterministic prisoner s dilemma dpd multi period supergame their behavior spd supergame based ids model
MISC--: our interest determining whether stochastic payoffs weaken cooperation how feedback affects cooperation
AIMX--: specifically we compare behavior full feedback stochastic game where each player learns about both her counterpart s actions payoffs behavior partial feedback game where each player only learns about her counterpart s payoffs
MISC--: this partial feedback game player may may not able infer her counterpart s action based payoffs received both players so ability pin loss counterpart may obscured
MISC--: behavior partial feedback game considerable interest today where each decision maker knows only what happened her but unclear cause
MISC--: social dilemmas each individual receives higher payoff making socially defecting choice e g polluting environment than pursuing socially cooperative choice no matter what other individuals society do
MISC--: furthermore all individuals better off if they all cooperate than if they all defect citation
AIMX--: methodological perspective we utilize bayesian hierarchical model understand more fully factors influence individuals invest socially beneficial protective measures over time whether there significant differences behavior when payoffs deterministic versus stochastic
CONT--: best our knowledge this first time bayesian hierarchical methods been applied analysis repeated prisoner s dilemma game experiments
MISC--: citation scientific perspective analysis enables us understand more fully how different treatments controlled experimental design affect distribution individual level parameters e g individual s likelihood retaliating against counterpart
MISC--: there several attractive features utilizing bayesian hierarchical models analyzing repeated prisoner s dilemma game experiments
MISC--: they include ability perform exact small sample inference where sample sizes likely small incorporate within person dependence repeated measures data understand drivers heterogeneity tying covariates subjects context their decisions their individual level parameters
MISC--: classic advantages bayesian methods citation ones particularly salient relevant analysis repeated prisoner s dilemma game experiments
OWNX--: foreshadow results our detailed analysis we summarize key findings paper follows
MISC--: two person prisoner s dilemma game individuals much more likely cooperative when payoffs deterministic dpd game than spd games where outcomes stochastic
CONT--: key factor behind this difference subjects spd games respond not just what their counterparts did but also whether not they suffered loss
MISC--: when person does not invest but his her counterpart does individual less likely reciprocate counterpart s investment next period if he she does not suffer loss
MISC--: comparing two aforementioned spd games one full feedback counterpart s behavior other only partial feedback counterpart s behavior overall amount cooperation investment was similar
OWNX--: however we found pattern cooperation was different two types games
MISC--: particular when subjects partial feedback game could learn their counterpart s actions implicitly they were less likely reciprocate their counterparts behavior than analogous situations full feedback game where subjects learned their counterparts behavior explicitly
AIMX--: remainder paper proceeds follows
OWNX--: section number provides brief summary theoretical empirical studies prisoners social dilemmas focus recent experiments noisy stochastic environment
OWNX--: section number we describe general formulation interdependent security ids two player game showing under what conditions takes form stochastic prisoner s dilemma game
OWNX--: after characterizing our experimental design set controlled laboratory experiments section number we then specify set between treatment hypotheses test them using regression analysis section number
OWNX--: section number we build bayesian hierarchical model enables us test hypotheses respect within subject behavior
OWNX--: section number summarizes findings discusses their prescriptive implications suggests areas future research
