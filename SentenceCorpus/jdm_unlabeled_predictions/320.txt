MISC--: narrow self interest often used simplifying assumption when studying people making decisions social contexts
MISC--: nonetheless people exhibit wide range different motivations when choosing unilaterally among interdependent outcomes
MISC--: measuring magnitude concern people others sometimes called social value orientation svo been interest many social scientists decades several different measurement methods been developed so far
AIMX--: here we introduce new measure svo several advantages over existent methods
MISC--: detailed description new measurement method presented along norming data provide evidence its solid psychometric properties
OWNX--: we conclude brief discussion research streams would benefit more sensitive higher resolution measure svo extend invitation others use this new measure freely available
MISC--: assumption narrow self interest central rational choice theory
MISC--: postulate decision makers dms concerned about maximizing their own material gain indifferent payoffs other dms around them
MISC--: this simplifying assumption yields powerful framework predict explain human decision making behavior across wide variety domains
MISC--: however there reliable counterexamples demonstrating dms elicited preferences choices often influenced part payoffs other dms thus challenging what some termed selfishness axiom citation
MISC--: studies motivations underlie interdependent decision behavior long history motivations been referred variety names including social preferences social motives other regarding preferences welfare tradeoff ratios social value orientation svo
AIMX--: consistency we refer this construct svo remainder this paper
MISC--: within svo framework assumed people vary their motivations goals when evaluating different resource allocations between themselves another person
MISC--: examples dm may endeavor maximize her own payoff individualistic maximize competitive minimize inequality averse difference between her own other person s payoff maximize joint payoffs prosocial
MISC--: worth noting however assumption narrow self interest itself particular svo namely perfectly individualistic orientation
MISC--: moreover considering spectrum different svos not challenge rational choice theory per se but rather extension postulate effort increase theory s psychological realism descriptive accuracy
MISC--: svo been found affect cognitions account behavior across range interpersonal decision making contexts specifically domain negotiation settings citation resource dilemmas citation
MISC--: svo also been identified covariate interacting different emotional states influencing propensity cooperate citation
MISC--: svos even been identified non human primates citation indicating some other species also show intrinsic preferences prosocial behavior
OWNX--: order use full explanatory power svo psychological construct we need measure efficiently reliably validly
MISC--: several different measurement methods quantifying variations svo across individuals been developed citation
CONT--: although use existent measures produced wealth findings even categorical approaches citation measures substantial limitations
MISC--: instance some measures yield only low resolution output lack sensitivity important individual differences providing at best nominal categorization citation
MISC--: other measures highly inefficient often fail produce consistent results substantial proportion subjects citation
MISC--: yet other methods require substantial time effort research subject order produce score citation
MISC--: moreover none existent measures explicitly designed detect more nuanced motivations like inequality aversion
MISC--: specifically previous measures not disentangled orientation joint gain maximization motivation minimize difference between outcomes
MISC--: although two orientations related they both indicate deviation individualism towards prosociality they substantially different motivations should differentiated both theoretically operationally
MISC--: furthermore social value orientation continuous construct corresponds quantity how much dm willing sacrifice order make another dm better off perhaps worse off
MISC--: this quantification interdependent utilities best represented continuous scale
MISC--: moreover since most commonly used svo measures date produce only categorical data substantial amount information related peoples social preferences being discarded ignored
MISC--: consequently full explanatory power svo not been used because this unnecessary sacrifice statistical power see cohen number discussion unfortunate practice reducing continuous variables categories
OWNX--: our view method assessing svo should yield high resolution output makes sensitive inter intra individual differences facilitate comparisons thereof easy use efficient able detect most prevalent svo individual differences allow evaluation rank orders social preferences yield meaningful results virtually all subjects
OWNX--: amongst criteria we consider demand high resolution measure produces data continuous scale crucial
AIMX--: we introduce here new measure svo takes this conceptualization into account allows greater explanatory potential svo through increased statistical power while also meeting aforementioned psychometric criteria
OWNX--: this new method referred svo slider measure
