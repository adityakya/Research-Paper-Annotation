OWNX--: we compare four different risk taking propensity measures their ability describe predict actual risky behavior domain health
MISC--: risk taking propensity measures we compare number general measure risk taking propensity derived one item survey question citation number risk aversion index calculated set incentivized monetary gambles citation number measure risk taking derived incentive compatible behavioral task balloon analog risk task citation number composite score risk taking likelihood health domain domain specific risk taking dospert scale citation
MISC--: study participants number clients health centers around witbank south africa
OWNX--: our findings suggest one item general measure best predictor risky health behavior our population predicting two out four behaviors at number percent level remaining two behaviors at number percent level
OWNX--: dospert score health domain performs well predicting one out four behaviors at number percent significance level two out four behaviors at number percent level but only if dospert instrument contains hypothetical risk taking item similar actual risky behavior being predicted
OWNX--: incentivized monetary gambles behavioral task were unrelated actual health behaviors they were unable predict any risky health behaviors at number percent level
OWNX--: we provide evidence this not because participants had trouble understanding monetary trade off questions performed poorly behavioral task
OWNX--: we conclude urging researchers further test usefulness one item general measure both explaining health related risk taking behavior other contexts
MISC--: risk taking part life but people differ their risk taking propensity
MISC--: some people enjoy risky pursuits while others detest activities
MISC--: psychologists economists developed various methods measure individual s risk taking propensity
AIMX--: this paper examines four different types risk taking propensity measures tests how well they predict risk taking health domain smoking problem drinking seat belt non use risky sexual behavior
MISC--: first risk taking propensity measure called dohmen measure this paper was developed dohmen et al citation
MISC--: elicited using one survey question directly asks about risk taking propensity how do you see yourself
MISC--: you generally person who fully prepared take risks do you try avoid taking risks
MISC--: please tick box scale where value number means not at all willing take risks value number means very willing take risks
MISC--: while straightforward simple administer dohmen measure been subject two concerns
OWNX--: first concern relates domain specificity
MISC--: generally accepted psychology behavior domain specific possible individuals show different levels risk taking propensity depending context citation
MISC--: thus dohmen measure being general measure may not able predict risk taking health domain example
MISC--: this concern greatly mitigated dohmen et al citation who showed general dohmen measure robust predictor behavior different domains including smoking behavior health domain
MISC--: second concern dohmen measure its lack incentive compatibility
MISC--: this issue derives general concern economists about incentive compatible measures respondents presumed work harder more persistently more effectively when money aligned performance citation
MISC--: case measuring people s risk taking propensity incentive compatibility usually achieved giving respondents choices between gambles paying them what they choose
MISC--: because dohmen question does not provide incentives motivate respondents answer truthfully respondents may misrepresent their answers
MISC--: charness viceisza citation instance administered dohmen question rural senegal found resulting distribution answers differ significantly found dohmen et al citation germany
MISC--: authors implied not having aligned incentives was reason discrepancy between measures found senegal germany but authors also alluded issues related translation difficulties including lack equivalent word risk wolof main national language senegal
AIMX--: second risk taking propensity measure called hl measure this paper was developed holt laury citation
MISC--: hl most common measure individual s risk taking propensity economics literature
OWNX--: participant hl makes ten separate choices between gambles where each choice entails choosing between risky gamble where high low payoffs r number r number respectively our study safer gamble where high low payoffs respectively r number r number
OWNX--: probability obtaining high vs low payoff risky gamble same probability obtaining high vs low payoff safer gamble
MISC--: this probability ranges number number number increments number number ten sets choices
OWNX--: when probability high payoff high at number number respondent high chance ending up r number under risky option r number under safer option this case only very risk averse would choose safer option
OWNX--: point at respondent switches safer option risky option used calculate risk aversion index
OWNX--: because one choice pairs randomly selected played real after respondent made all number choices respondent knows about this before making any choices hl measure incentive compatible
MISC--: because hl measure derived using monetary gambles unclear whether measure derived monetary domain related risky health behavior
MISC--: this question not been widely studied
CONT--: anderson mellor citation using sample almost number number mostly college educated respondents u s found hl measure associated smoking heavy drinking seat belt non use but only at number percent significance level
MISC--: lammers citation using sample about number college students south africa found hl measure unrelated condom use
AIMX--: third risk taking propensity measure used this paper bart citation behavioral risk task performed computer
MISC--: task number trials
MISC--: each trial begins un inflated balloon screen
OWNX--: clicking computer mouse makes balloon grow bigger earns participant number cents per click
MISC--: every balloon different pre set level inflation before bursts participant does not know number clicks made before any balloon bursts
MISC--: at any point during each trial participant stop clicking bank money earned trial computer makes slot machine coin dispensing sound
MISC--: if however balloon over inflated beyond its pre set level balloon bursts money trial gone
OWNX--: at end task participant paid all money banked
MISC--: bart task essence measures actual risk taking propensity individual
MISC--: because earnings feedback given after each trial either casino sound when money banked explosion noise if balloon bursts bart decisions made hot psychological state citation
OWNX--: hl decisions contrast made cold psychological state because actual earnings hl task revealed after all choices been made
MISC--: dislich et al citation use term impulsive risk taking describe bart term reflective risk taking describe task similar hl
MISC--: bart been shown associated psychological measures risk taking sensation seeking personality self reported behavioral risks including smoking heavy drinking drug use sexual risk taking gambling stealing etc
MISC--: citation
MISC--: however bart good predictor health related risk taking not consistent finding literature
MISC--: reynolds et al citation found bart was uncorrelated study s self reported personality measures related risk taking
MISC--: gordon citation found bart uncorrelated attitudes towards risky driving
MISC--: dean et al citation found smokers did not display greater risk taking bart than nonsmokers
MISC--: klassen citation found bart was unrelated any alcohol consumption measures examined
BASE--: our fourth measure uses modified version domain specific risk taking scale dospert developed weber et al citation
MISC--: dospert asks about one s likelihood pursue various hypothetical but risky activities each five domains financial ethical health safety social recreational then aggregates activity specific risk taking propensity scores into domain specific risk taking propensity scores
MISC--: this contrast dohmen measure elicits single global risk taking propensity
MISC--: dospert domain scores been shown associated real life risk taking activities within same domain
MISC--: instance hanoch et al citation found smokers had significantly higher risk taking propensity scores health domain than respondents comparison group consisting gym members athletes gamblers investors
OWNX--: zuniga bouzas citation found dospert health safety recreational risk taking scores significantly predicted blood alcohol concentrations mexican high school students
AIMX--: current study we examine dohmen hl bart dospert measures population clients at health clinics south africa test how measures relate health risk taking terms smoking drinking seat belt non use risky sexual practices
OWNX--: our study makes few contributions
MISC--: we extend work dohmen et al citation testing how one item measure fares predicting unhealthy behavior other than smoking
AIMX--: we test ability incentive based hl bart tasks explaining activities health domain using implementation hl task may interest other researchers addresses concerns citation about respondent understanding this risk task
