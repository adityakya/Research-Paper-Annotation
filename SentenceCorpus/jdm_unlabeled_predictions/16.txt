MISC--: contrary common belief more information always better gigerenzer et al citation showed simple decision strategies rely little information quite successful
MISC--: success simple strategies depends both bets about structure environment core capacities human mind recognition memory citation
MISC--: however interplay between environment mind s core capacities rarely been precisely modeled
OWNX--: we illustrate how environment mind interactions could formally modeled within cognitive architecture act r citation
MISC--: act r integrated theory mind tuned statistical structure environment account variety phenomena learning problem solving decision making
AIMX--: here we focus studying decision strategies show how success theses strategies particular environments depends characteristics core cognitive capacities recognition short term memory
MISC--: six million dollar man was among most popular television shows number s at least among eight twelve year old american boys
MISC--: credits open spectacular crash rocket jet tumbling into fireball
MISC--: team surgeons hovers over steve austin test pilot working feverishly replace his injured legs right arm eye superbly engineered bionic substitutes
OWNX--: voice over we hear gentlemen we rebuild him
OWNX--: we technology
OWNX--: we capability make world s first bionic man
MISC--: steve austin will man
MISC--: better than he was before
MISC--: better stronger faster
OWNX--: we cut next steve austin six million dollar man racing across field seeing objects at distance his better than telescope eye
OWNX--: like steve austin s doctors most us believe we would better off if we were stronger faster
OWNX--: similarly we would better off at least would had better college transcripts if we had been blessed bionic cognitive abilities unfailing memories ability hold complex equations mind
MISC--: another view humble cognitive capacities human mind those limitations forgetting may serve important functions
OWNX--: arguably most important function memory not simply store all information we encounter but provide us important information specific situations
MISC--: this view human memory system organized way facilitates retrieval information recent frequent citation sensitive context citation
OWNX--: this way system retrieves memories information we most likely need
MISC--: many word processors incorporate timesaving feature illustrates this view forgetting
MISC--: when user goes open document file program presents file buffer list recently opened files user select
OWNX--: whenever desired file included list user spared effort searching through file hierarchy
CONT--: this device work efficiently however word processor must provide users files they actually want
MISC--: does so forgetting files considered unlikely needed basis assumption time since file was last opened negatively correlated its likelihood being needed now
MISC--: similarly if you want remember where you parked your car quite useful forget where you parked before
MISC--: there growing evidence also other domains language acquisition cognitive limits beneficial citation while too much thinking even hurt performance example sports experts citation implicit category learning decaro thomas beilock press
MISC--: line this view mind adaptation environment program fast frugal heuristics takes position humans possess repertoire cognitive strategies heuristics solve specific problems citation
MISC--: gigerenzer et al called this collection cognitive strategies adaptive toolbox
MISC--: rationality heuristics not logical but ecological success anchored both structure environment core capacities human mind citation
OWNX--: cognitive strategy simple exploiting core capacities recognition recall memory human mind through evolution learning highly automatized requiring little no effort
MISC--: goldstein gigerenzer citation consider heuristics adaptive strategies evolved tandem fundamental psychological mechanisms p number
MISC--: within fast frugal program this interplay between environment mind rarely been explored detailed models core capacities
MISC--: models heuristics presupposed specific core capacities mind recognition memory without embedding core capacity directly into model
MISC--: other words models heuristics many other models decision making underspecified regard how decision making will affected interaction between mind s core capacities structure environment
AIMX--: goal this paper illustrate how cognitive modeling capture environment mind interactions thereby inform decision making research
OWNX--: particular we employ formal cognitive architecture act r citation explore this issue
MISC--: principle other cognitive models memory could used purpose analyzing relation between environment memory performance inference strategies
OWNX--: fact we believe main findings regarding memory function ecological rationality inference strategies would remain largely same long reasonable model memory was used
MISC--: one model rem citation descends sam citation but enriched bayesian analysis spirit j r anderson s rational analysis citation
MISC--: another good candidate would minerva dm citation been shown account wide variety judgment phenomena including example availability representativeness heuristics
MISC--: relation between act r other models will discussed more detail general discussion where we will also illustrate how act r could extended topics tasks beyond those examined here
