MISC--: five experiments addressed controversy probability judgment literature centers efficacy framing probabilities frequencies
MISC--: natural frequency view predicts frequency formats attenuate errors while nested sets view predicts highlighting set subset structure problem reduces error regardless problem format
OWNX--: this study tested predictions using conjunction task
MISC--: previous studies reporting frequency formats reduced conjunction errors confounded reference class problem format
MISC--: after controlling this confound present study s findings show conjunction errors reduced using either probability frequency format frequency effects depend upon presence reference class frequency formats do not promote better statistical reasoning than probability formats
MISC--: evidence suggests information presented frequency formats rather than probability formats attenuates many cognitive biases found probabilistic reasoning citation
MISC--: there evidence frequency advantage bayesian reasoning citation overcoming overconfidence bias citation reducing conjunction errors extensional reasoning citation
MISC--: although specific explanations frequency effect vary task general conclusion reached proponents natural frequency perspective presenting frequencies promotes intuitive statistical reasoning because formats compatible evolutionary based computational algorithm citation
MISC--: alternative explanations well contradictory evidence frequency effect been offered citation
MISC--: particular nested sets hypothesis citation suggests frequency effects may indirect consequence inducing set inclusion problem representation contributes making problem s logical structure transparent thus easily solvable
MISC--: according nested sets hypothesis presenting information way allows people extract subsets relative supersets problem structure key facilitating reasoning
MISC--: facilitation occur whether not information presented frequencies probabilities so long critical set subset structure made salient
MISC--: example sloman et al citation tested three versions medical diagnosis problem first posed casscells schoenberger grayboys citation
MISC--: probability version problem was stated follows frequency version problem adapted cosmides tooby citation was stated follows third problem version was nest sets probability version highlighted set subset structure problem
OWNX--: was stated follows note all three problem versions specific reference class i e number americans provided
MISC--: what different between problem versions however both frequency version nest sets probability version highlight set subset structure among critical categories those who test positive whether not they disease number number those who test positive disease number number
MISC--: natural frequency hypothesis predicts only frequency problem version will facilitate bayesian reasoning result approximately correct solution number number number percent
MISC--: nested sets hypothesis predicts both frequency version nested sets probability version will facilitate correct responding because both versions make set subset relationships among critical categories transparent
MISC--: sloman et al s citation findings support nested sets hypothesis
MISC--: they found probability version resulted significantly fewer correct answers than did either frequency version nested sets probability version
MISC--: latter two problem versions did not significantly differ number correct solutions they elicited
MISC--: evans et al citation ran similar study but included frequency hard condition false positive rate number percent was stated number number instead number number thus obscuring problem s nested sets structure
MISC--: further support nested sets hypothesis evans et al citation found both probability frequency hard problem versions resulted significantly fewer correct responses than did frequency version highlighted set subset structure stating false positive rate number number
MISC--: results also consistent findings reported macchi citation mellers mcgraw citation who offered similar interpretations
MISC--: perhaps strongest evidence favor nested sets hypothesis provided yamagishi citation who presented bayesian reasoning problem frequency probability formats crossed presence absence diagrammatical representation problem structure roulette wheel whose areas reflect relative proportion hits misses false positives
MISC--: he found absence diagram there was frequency effect
MISC--: presence diagram however there was no significant difference proportion correct responses between frequency probability problem formats
MISC--: evidence suggests bayesian reasoning facilitated proper problem representation frequency formats offer no additional advantage when problem structure task clarified
MISC--: aside bayesian reasoning almost no research examining nested sets hypothesis been conducted other judgment biases frequency effects also been reported
MISC--: theoretically meaningful extend growing evidence favoring nested sets hypothesis tasks reveal failures extensional reasoning conjunction fallacy citation
AIMX--: date only two published accounts examined frequency effects classic linda problem citation only one study provided direct test nested sets hypothesis problem citation
MISC--: both fiedler citation hertwig gigerenzer citation reported frequency formats led fewer proportions participants committing conjunction errors comparison probability formats
MISC--: there was potential confound those studies however
MISC--: reference class was given frequency version problem was absent probability version
MISC--: unclear those studies whether reduction conjunction errors direct result manipulating problem format result presenting information manner facilitates problem representation
MISC--: illustrate consider two versions linda problem presented fiedler citation
OWNX--: both versions presented following information probability format participants were asked rank order list number statements about linda according their probability
MISC--: among statements were two constituent categories linda bank teller linda active feminist movement their conjunction linda bank teller active feminist movement
MISC--: frequency format participants were given same information statements judge but were asked how many number women who like linda do following statements apply
MISC--: note frequency format asks numeric frequency estimate provides specific reference class out make estimate
MISC--: probability format asks ranks does not provide reference class judgment
MISC--: similar confound existed studies reported hertwig gigerenzer citation
MISC--: confound between response mode numeric estimate vs rank reference class present vs absent prohibits clear interpretation findings
MISC--: indeed hertwig chase citation reported significantly more conjunction errors committed ranking probability response mode than numeric probability estimation response mode
MISC--: frequency effect found both fiedler citation hertwig gigerenzer citation studies could result confounding response mode problem format citation
MISC--: facilitating effect frequency format could also secondary consequence providing participants reference class focusing their attention sub categories within class rather than direct result framing problem frequency judgment
MISC--: sloman et al citation reported finding no significant differences between frequency probability formats linda problem when set inclusion relationships between critical categories were made opaque separating constituent categories their conjunction seven filler statements
MISC--: their finding suggests when set subset structure problem obscured frequency effect disappears
MISC--: finding consistent nested sets hypothesis
MISC--: purpose present study examine whether frequency effects remain after controlling reference class confound noted earlier research conjunction errors
