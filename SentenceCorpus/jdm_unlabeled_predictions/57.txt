OWNX--: ratio bias phenomenon observed psychologist seymour epstein colleagues systematic manifestation irrationality
MISC--: when offered choice between two lotteries individuals consistently choose lottery greater number potential successes even when offers smaller probability success
AIMX--: current study we conduct experiments confirm this phenomenon test existence bias distinct general irrationality
OWNX--: moreover we examine effect introducing monetary incentive varying size depending treatment extent irrational choices within this framework
OWNX--: we confirm existence bias
MISC--: moreover existence incentive significantly reduces extent irrationality exhibited this effect roughly linear response changes size incentive within magnitudes investigated
OWNX--: consider following problem you asked draw red marble either two urns
MISC--: urn contains number marbles number red
MISC--: urn b contains number marbles number red
MISC--: urn do you choose
MISC--: rational actor maximizing probability choosing red marble will choose urn
MISC--: psychologist seymour epstein colleagues citation documented many individuals choose urn b when presented this choice similar choices
OWNX--: epstein named this ratio bias phenomenon appears individuals biased toward choices large numbers potential successes rather than large probabilities potential successes
MISC--: present investigation explores ratio bias phenomenon along two dimensions
OWNX--: first we test errors within this framework symmetric fashion
MISC--: referring example above we not only present participants decisions like one but also decisions urn larger number marbles greater probability success therefore optimal choice
OWNX--: if we observe similar frequencies errors two circumstances then we conclude there no real ratio bias phenomenon but rather observation random error both directions
OWNX--: if frequency irrational decisions differs across treatments however then we conclude ratio bias phenomenon exists
MISC--: second dimension interest incentives
MISC--: participant ratio bias experiment confronts decision well suited introduction small monetary incentive testing its marginal effect
OWNX--: we implement combination within between subjects design test effect monetary incentives decision making well varying size incentive test effect incentive magnitude decision optimality
