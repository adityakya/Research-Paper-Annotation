MISC--: this research examines relationship between positive negative perceptions pensions motivation engage decision process choosing private pension plan well satisfaction chosen pension plan among trained economists
MISC--: sample number economists completed self report survey examining decision process different decision contexts life including pension decisions
OWNX--: overall participants showed low motivation engage process choosing private pension plan compared their motivation engage other decision tasks
MISC--: however economists invested more decision process showed greater satisfaction their decision regarding their pension plan when they had more positive perception pensions
OWNX--: this perception represented higher subjective likelihood receiving pension allowances long period profitable view balance between current payments expected incomes pension saving
MISC--: studies demonstrated people show low motivation engage process choosing pension plan expressed their minor involvement process citation
MISC--: result they tend settle default choice citation show passivity procrastination decision making citation sometimes avoid making decision citation
MISC--: lusardi citation found most people given very little thought retirement even when they just few years away leaving workforce
MISC--: benartzi thaler citation reviewed empirical works lay people s heuristics biases their savings retirement decisions
MISC--: they show lay people slow join advantageous plans make infrequent changes adopt naive diversification strategies when establishing their portfolio
MISC--: addition they rely non experts advice spouses friends tend influenced framing manipulations
MISC--: nowadays people living longer than ever retirement becoming more more expensive cost living especially medical care prescription drugs continues increase
MISC--: planners more likely experience satisfying retirement because they greater financial resources rely after they stop working citation
MISC--: therefore important understand lack motivation engage process choosing pension plan well find ways increase involvement motivation
MISC--: one reasons lay people s low involvement might most people simply do not knowledge capacity interpret information presented them employers governments regarding private pension plans
MISC--: they do not know how appropriately evaluate balance choices make decision based weighing alternatives
MISC--: when given default option knowing pension plan most people choose suggested employees committee lay people may use make quick decision put issue aside even when this pension plan may not best them personally
MISC--: when people confronted large number options more options they given less likely they engaged choice task citation especially when alternatives seen relatively similar they not able understand variations among them
MISC--: lack relevant knowledge understanding may major reason peoples low involvement pension decision processes citation
MISC--: other hand if lack knowledge main reason people s low interest we would expect experts well educated economists who do knowledge resources understanding behave differently showing real efforts make best decision regarding their future incomes
MISC--: spite above assumption behavioral decision research suggests even required knowledge people might not act according rational models systematically examining different options their relevant attributes citation
MISC--: experts like lay people also prone simplifying heuristics biases citation
MISC--: moreover when choice task complex includes many objects when objects relatively similar some their attributes tendency use intuitive simplifying strategies increases
MISC--: besides simplifying heuristics emotional reactions towards task might also affect decisions both experts lay people
MISC--: specifically perception feelings towards pension concept may affect decision maker s attitude toward task
MISC--: affect information hypothesis citation suggests judgments affected positive negative feelings towards decision target other people places objects well words memories etc
MISC--: 
OWNX--: positive negative emotions toward decision task might directly affect decision process
MISC--: negative emotions towards pension retirement might result unpleasant thoughts negative images future raised at time pension decisions financial dependence ill health death aging disabilities citation
MISC--: thoughts may psychologically threatening anxiety provoking causing retirement anxiety citation may not restricted older adults
MISC--: interestingly hayslip et al found younger adults showed even greater anxiety about retirement than older adults
MISC--: indeed results neukam hershey citation suggest lay people who experience retirement anxiety less likely plan save future
MISC--: addition since people see their pension expenses their pay slips every month incomes expected only distant future they might perceive their contributions greater than discounted future income streams
MISC--: benartzi thaler citation suggest people may experience myopic loss aversion their saving retirement decisions being hypersensitive short term losses
MISC--: negative perceptions may decrease people s motivation invest decision increasing heuristics biases decision process
MISC--: some people may believe they would not enjoy their pension many years therefore might perceive pension expense only little gain
MISC--: optimistic people same objective life expectancy who believe they will receive their pension payments longer period time expected more positive attitude towards their pension
OWNX--: their thoughts about their future well their pension fund evaluation expected more positive living longer means receiving more money pension plans
MISC--: positive views held more optimistic people may enhance motivation engage decision process may produce better satisfaction chosen pension plan
MISC--: summary positive negative perceptions pension concept likely guide emotional reactions toward decision task at time decision therefore expected influence motivation invest decision process
MISC--: low motivation invest decision process may lead insufficient search information set default option other shortcuts may lead decision departs decision maker s best interest
OWNX--: we suggest two main factors may shape subjective perceptions pensions first optimistic pessimistic subjective views likelihood receive pension payments at least number years
MISC--: pension decisions may fundamentally different people who believe saving today will allow them secure their standard living future opposed people pessimistic perceptions same expected longevity
MISC--: people who perceive likelihood enjoying their pension many years higher expected care more about not having adequate financial means their old age since possibility experience need more concrete real them
MISC--: therefore optimistic people more likely make efforts show greater motivation invest their pension decision
OWNX--: we note use terms optimism pessimism all through paper refers subjective evaluation likelihood receive pension payments at least number years rather than general personality trait
MISC--: second perceptions balance between gains losses pension payments this balance might represent positive perception pensions when people believe future discounted benefits would greater than current discounted future contributions negative perception if reverse
OWNX--: we hypothesize motivation invest pension decisions would greater people who positive view pensions retirement caused one both above factors
MISC--: people expected more involved decision process examining larger number alternatives before choosing pension plan searching more information about chosen plan
