MISC--: dynamic connectionist models decision making decision field theory citation propose effect context choice arises series pairwise comparisons between attributes alternatives across time
MISC--: they predict limiting amount time make decision should decrease rather than increase size contextual effects
MISC--: this prediction was tested across four levels time pressure both asymmetric dominance citation compromise citation decoy effects choice
OWNX--: overall results supported this prediction both types decoy effects found larger time pressure decreased
MISC--: wide body research demonstrated contextual sensitivity preference showing preferences some degree depend upon set inferior alternatives considered at time choice
MISC--: decoy effects asymmetric dominance ad citation compromise effects c citation common examples this sensitivity
MISC--: particular decoy effects examples preference reversals situations preference ordering between two alternatives changes changes context
MISC--: although much research focused demonstrating explaining decoy effects little work been done explore effect time pressure effect decoy
