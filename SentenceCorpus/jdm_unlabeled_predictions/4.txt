MISC--: decision making research often dichotomises between more deliberative cognitive processes more heuristic intuitive emotional processes
MISC--: we argue within this two systems framework citation there ambiguity over how map system number system number axis notion intuitive processing onto distinction between conscious non conscious processes
MISC--: however convergent concepts experience based metacognitive judgements citation fringe consciousness citation clarify intuitive processing informative conscious feeling without conscious access antecedents feeling
OWNX--: we stress intuitive feelings used guide behaviour controlled contextually sensitive manner would not permitted purely non conscious influences behaviour
MISC--: outline provided how empirically recognise intuitive feelings
MISC--: this illustrated example research implicit learning where intuitive feelings may play important role peoples decisions judgements
OWNX--: finally we suggest our approach understanding intuitive feelings softens rather than reinforces two systems dichotomy
MISC--: influential two systems framework within decision making judgement research dichotomises between processes characterised heuristic affective intuitive versus those seen more deliberative cognitive rational
OWNX--: following stanovich west citation we refer supposedly separable systems system number s number system number s number respectively
MISC--: kahneman citation declares there considerable agreement over properties systems s number include being fast automatic effortless associative difficult control modify s number include being slower serial effortful deliberately controlled relatively flexible
BASE--: citation despite tendency associate s number non conscious processing s number conscious processing we suggest within representative formulations this two systems framework kahneman s citation summary his nobel prize winning work epstein s citation seminal paper there considerable ambiguity over how map system number system number axis notion intuitive processing onto distinction between conscious non conscious processes
AIMX--: our aim this paper outline this ambiguity argue why clarification important describe how clarification made both theoretically empirically suggest how consideration consciousness dimension soften two systems dichotomy
