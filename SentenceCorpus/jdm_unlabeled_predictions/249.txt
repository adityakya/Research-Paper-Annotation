AIMX--: this paper examines how observing other people s behavior affects risk taking repeated decision tasks
MISC--: study number number participants performed experience based decision tasks either alone pairs two members being exposed each others choices outcomes
MISC--: tasks involved either equiprobable gains losses frequent small gains rare large losses
MISC--: results indicated both risk types social exposure increased proportion risky selection but its effect was stronger rare loss condition
OWNX--: study number rare loss task was administered number study participants target individual observing choices paired individual
MISC--: results showed observing others rather than being observed led pattern increased risk taking
MISC--: findings two studies indicate importance distinguishing different types risky situations shed light contradictory findings literature
MISC--: effect social environment individual decision making important because many naturally occurring individual behaviors conducted presence others
MISC--: this area investigation often studied field social learning citation focused situations individuals opportunity learn others experience
MISC--: studies this field tend address situations where actions differ their objective value but this information not shared among all individuals
MISC--: therefore observing others behavior adds important information about right action follow
MISC--: hardly any empirical research this field focused interesting problem where main difference between alternatives their associated risk variance
AIMX--: another field study relevant current context study group behavior groups typically asked reach consensus
MISC--: studies group behavior addressed question social influence risk taking
MISC--: main finding this line research groups tend hold more extreme risk attitudes than those their individual members
MISC--: this finding typically referred group polarization groupthink phenomenon citation
MISC--: surprisingly little research been devoted individual risk taking decisions social context people able observe aspects each other s behavior situation we refer social exposure
MISC--: research conducted yielded mixed results
MISC--: blank citation found repeated choice task exposing three individuals each others outcomes facilitated risk taking compared choices made alone citation
MISC--: conversely blaskovitch veach ginsburg citation experimental game blackjack found no effect social exposure citation
MISC--: mixed findings also appear relevant applied studies
MISC--: presence co acting individuals was found increase risky street crossing computerized task but only adolescents not adults citation yet facilitated more risky crossing field studies citation
MISC--: still mixed findings usually ignored this research area often briefly discussed extension group polarization phenomenon observed consensual decisions citation
MISC--: goal current study clarify effect social exposure two types risk taking situations involving losses
MISC--: one type comprises cases gains losses equally likely
MISC--: other type involves asymmetry likelihood magnitude gains losses particularly comprising typical small gains rare large losses
MISC--: robust behavioral regularity experience based decision making when expected values similar people choose according alternative produces best outcomes most time citation
MISC--: accordingly people more likely select risky alternatives producing rare losses typical gains than those producing equiprobable gains losses phenomenon indeed widely observed citation
MISC--: yet note same principle predicts when risky alternative produces rare losses information concerning others behavior would increase risk taking
MISC--: this situation others choice outcomes increase salience awareness differences between typical favorable outcome risky alternative typically unfavorable outcome safe alternative
MISC--: instance consider laboratory decision task consisting safe alternative s producing number each trial risky alternative r producing number number out number selections number remaining selections
MISC--: task repeated payoffs contingent option chosen
MISC--: if individual decided stop selecting r then he she no longer supplied additional evidence obtained outcome s number worse than r s number most time
MISC--: social situation however others who take risk pick r naturally continuing transmit this information decision maker thus likely increase level risk taking
OWNX--: results consistent this hypothesis were reported studies examined effect obtaining feedback unselected choice alternatives i e foregone payoffs compared obtaining feedback selected ones only
MISC--: decision tasks risky alternative producing rare negative outcomes common favorable outcomes individuals provided foregone payoffs continually presented favorable outcomes this alternative
MISC--: indeed foregone payoffs increase level risk taking tasks citation
MISC--: however this effect not been observed risky alternatives producing equally likely gains losses betting color roulette wheel citation
MISC--: latter pattern explained fact when risky alternative equally likely produce gains losses then its outcomes not better most time adding foregone payoffs does not change fact
OWNX--: our main argument similarly effect foregone payoffs being exposed others choices outcomes decision task would increase risk taking tasks involving rare losses
OWNX--: two controlled laboratory studies were conducted examine this prediction
MISC--: study number evaluated effect mutual exposure other people s choices decision tasks involving rare equiprobable losses
OWNX--: results showed while social exposure increased risk taking both decision tasks had larger effect rare loss condition
