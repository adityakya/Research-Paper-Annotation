MISC--: studying group decision making challenging multiple reasons
MISC--: important logistic difficulty studying sufficiently large number groups each multiple participants
BASE--: assembling groups online could make this process easier also provide access group members more representative real world work groups than sample college students typically comprise lab face face ftf groups
AIMX--: main goal this paper compare decisions online groups those ftf groups
OWNX--: we did so study manipulated gain loss framing risky decision between groups examined decisions both individual group members groups
OWNX--: all dependent measures compared online ftf sample
OWNX--: our results suggest web conferencing substitute ftf interaction group decision making research we found no moderation effects communication medium individual group decision outcome variables
OWNX--: effects medium were found suggest use online groups may preferred method group research
CONT--: wit discussions among online groups were shorter but generated greater number thought units i e they made more efficient use time
MISC--: studying group decision making more challenging than studying individual decision making multiple reasons
MISC--: requires more complex data analysis methods due increase number levels analysis relevant variables
MISC--: also requires increased sample sizes sufficient statistical power test hypotheses groups rather than individuals unit analysis
MISC--: groups consist members themselves constitute sources variance this further complicated variation social interactions group members between groups
MISC--: all this increases between group variability increases required sample size detect effects experimental manipulations
CONT--: another challenge practical requirement needing group members present at same time location where single no shows lead cancelled experimental sessions
