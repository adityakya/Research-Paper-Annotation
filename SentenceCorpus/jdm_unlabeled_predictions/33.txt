OWNX--: this article i will show how several observed biases human probabilistic reasoning partially explained good heuristics making inferences environment where probabilities uncertainties associated them
OWNX--: previous results show weight functions observed violations coalescing stochastic dominance understood bayesian point view
MISC--: we will review those results see bayesian methods should also used part explanation behind other known biases
MISC--: means although observed errors still errors under laboratory conditions they demonstrated they percent xx understood adaptations solution real life problems
MISC--: heuristics allow fast evaluations mimic bayesian inference would evolutionary advantage since they would give us efficient way making decisions
MISC--: well known fact humans make mistakes when presented probabilistic problems
MISC--: famous paradoxes allais citation ellsberg citation was observed when faced choice between different gambles people make their choices way not compatible normative decision theory
MISC--: several attempts describe this behavior exist literature including prospect theory citation cumulative prospect theory citation number configural weighting models citation
CONT--: all models use idea when analyzing probabilistic gambles people alter stated probabilistic values using s shaped weighting function wp use altered values order calculate gamble would provide maximum expected return
CONT--: exact details all operations involved calculations values associated each branch bet coalescing equal branches aspects framing dealt differently each model but models agree people do not use exact known probabilistic values when making their decisions
MISC--: there also models based different approaches decision sampling model
MISC--: decision sampling proposes people make their decision making comparisons attribute values remembered them describe many characteristics human reasoning well citation
MISC--: recently strong evidence appeared indicating configural weighting models describe human behavior better than prospect theory
MISC--: several tests shown people don t obey simple decision rules
MISC--: if bet presented two equal possible outcomes example number percent chance getting number one outcome number percent chance getting same return number another possible result should make no difference if both outcomes were combined into one single possibility number percent chance obtaining number
OWNX--: this property called coalescing branches been observed not always respected citation
MISC--: other strong requirement decision theory violated laboratory experiments people should obey stochastic dominance
MISC--: stochastic dominance happens when there two bets available possible gains one them good other one at least one possibility gain more
CONT--: per example given bets g number number number number number number g number number number number number number number number number g clearly dominates g since first outcome same second outcome g split into two possibilities g returning same more than g depending luck
MISC--: only rational choice here g but laboratory tests show people do not always follow this simple rule citation
MISC--: since rank dependent models prospect theory cumulative prospect theory obey both stochastic dominance coalescing branches configural weight models predict those violations probably better description real behavior
MISC--: configural weight models each branch bet given different weight so branches worst outcome will given more weight decider
MISC--: this allows those basic principles violated
OWNX--: however although configural weight models good descriptive models telling how we reason problem understanding why we reason way we do not solved them
OWNX--: violations normative theory predicts violations very simple strong principles makes sense ask why people would make obvious mistakes
MISC--: until recently reason why humans make mistakes was still not completely clear
MISC--: evolutionary psychologists suggested makes no sense humans would module their brains made wrong probability assessments citation therefore there must some logical explanation those biases
OWNX--: was also suggested since our ancestors had deal observed frequencies instead probability values observed biases might disappear if people were presented data form observed frequencies typical bayes theorem problem
MISC--: gigerenzer hoffrage citation conducted experiment confirming this idea
MISC--: however other studies checking those claims citation shown frequency formats seem improve reasoning only under some circumstances
MISC--: if those circumstances not met frequency formats either no effect might even cause worse probability evaluations tested subjects
MISC--: other hand proponents heuristics biases point view claim given our intellectual powers necessarily limited errors should expected best one hope humans would use heuristics efficient but prone error citation
MISC--: matter fact they shown decision problems there simple heuristics do surprisingly good job citation
CONT--: but since many calculations involved laboratory experiments not too difficult perform question reasons behind our probabilistic reasoning mistakes still needed answering
MISC--: if we using reasonable heuristics perform probabilistic calculations understanding when this good heuristic why fails tests important question
MISC--: course na number ve idea people should simply use observed frequencies instead probability values certainly improved bayesian point view
OWNX--: argument our ancestors should well adapted deal uncertainty their own observations quite compelling but make complete we ask what would happen if our ancestors minds therefore our own were actually more sophisticated than simple frequentistic mind
MISC--: if they had brain although possibly using rules thumb behaved way mimicked bayesian inference instead frequentistic evaluation they would better equipped make sound decisions therefore would been good adaptation
OWNX--: other words our ancestors who were approximately bayesians would better adapted than any possible cousins who didn t consider uncertainty their analysis
MISC--: would eventually lead those cousins extinction
OWNX--: course another possibility we learn those heuristics we grow up adjusting them provide better answers
MISC--: but even if this dynamics behind our heuristics good learning should lead us closer bayesian answer than afrequentistic one
MISC--: so makes sense ask if humans actually smarter than current literature describes them
OWNX--: evidence supporting idea our reasoning resembles bayesian reasoning already exists
MISC--: tenenbaum et al press shown observed inductive reasoning modeled theory based bayesian models those models provide approximately optimal inference
MISC--: tests human cognitive judgments about everyday phenomena seems suggest our inferences provide very good prediction real statistics citation
MISC--: recent work citation i proposed adaptive probability theory apt
MISC--: apt claims biases human probabilistic reasoning actually understood approximation bayesian inference
MISC--: if one supposes people treat all probability values if they were uncertain even when they not make some assumptions about sample size where those probabilities would been observed frequencies follows observed shape weighting functions obtained
OWNX--: here i will review those results also show we extend ideas were introduced explain weighting functions explain other observed biases
MISC--: i will show some those biases partially explained result mind adapted make inferences environment where probabilities uncertainties associated them
MISC--: weighting functions prospect theory whole class models use weighting functions describe our behavior understood predicted bayesian point view
MISC--: even observed violations descriptive prospect theory violations coalescing stochastic dominance need configural weight models properly described also predicted using apt
MISC--: i will propose bayesian methods should used part explanation behind number other biases citation
OWNX--: finally note what apt really epistemological point view needed
MISC--: usually science involves working theories should describe set data making predictions those theories testing them experiments
MISC--: decision theory however requires broader definition proper scientific work
OWNX--: this happens because unlike other areas we normative decision theory tells us how we should reason
OWNX--: does not necessarily describe real behavior since based assumptions about what best choice not about how real people behave
MISC--: its testing against other decision strategies long provides optimal decisions normative theory correct even if does not predict behavior any kind agents
MISC--: means certain actions labeled wrong sense they far optimal decisions even though they correspond real actions real people
MISC--: this peculiarity decision theory means not every model needs actually predict behavior
OWNX--: given non optimal observed behavior understanding what makes deciders behave way also valid line inquiry
MISC--: where apt stands
MISC--: its main purpose show apparently irrational behavior based analysis decision problem follows normative theory
OWNX--: assumptions behind analysis might wrong therefore observed behavior would not optimal
OWNX--: means our common sense not perfect
MISC--: however if works well most real life problems either good adaptation well learned
MISC--: apt intends make bridge between normative descriptive theories
MISC--: this means exploratory work sense trying understand problems led our minds reason way they do
OWNX--: while based normative theory was designed agree observed biases
OWNX--: this means apt does not claim best actual description real behavior although might
MISC--: even if other theories configural weight models decision sampling actually describe correctly way our minds really work long their predictions compatible apt apt will show actual behavior predicted those theories reasonable approximation optimal decisions
OWNX--: laboratory tests show if apt actually best description not we will see apt suggests new experiments problem base rate neglect order understand better our reasoning
OWNX--: but main goal apt show real behavior reasonable does well
