MISC--: recently been observed different choices made about structurally identical risky decisions depending whether information about outcomes their probabilities learned description experience
MISC--: current evidence equivocal respect whether this choice gap entirely artefact biased samples
MISC--: current experiment investigates whether representational bias exists at point encoding examining choice light decision makers mental representations alternatives measured both verbal nonverbal judgment probes
OWNX--: we found when estimates were gauged nonverbal probe participants presented information description format opposed experience had greater tendency overestimate rare events underestimate common events
CONT--: choice gap however remained even when accounting this judgment distortion effects sampling bias
OWNX--: indeed participants estimation outcome distribution did not mediate their subsequent choice
MISC--: appears experience based choices may derive process does not explicitly use probability information
MISC--: recent years quickly growing literature emerged contrasting two different formats choice description experience correspondence decisions observed each citation
MISC--: decision experience dfe one where possible outcomes estimates their probabilities learned through integration personal observation feedback environment citation
MISC--: typical example might decision where buy your morning coffee you make your way work
MISC--: contrast decision description dfd one where all possible outcomes their probabilities explicitly laid out outset citation
MISC--: typical example might decision bring umbrella work after hearing morning weather forecast chance precipitation
MISC--: surprisingly recent evidence found decisions made under two different formats choice diverge
MISC--: example hertwig barron weber erev citation presented six binary risky choice problems participants either described experienced format
MISC--: description format outcomes their probabilities were completely specified form choose between number certain b number probability number percent otherwise zero
MISC--: participants playing this description based choice task tended make decisions consistent prospect theory s four fold pattern choice risk aversion gains risk seeking losses when probabilities were moderate high but risk seeking gains risk aversion losses when probabilities were small citation
MISC--: example number percent participants preferred certain number decision above
MISC--: experience format participants were initially unaware outcomes their respective probabilities had learn this information sampling two unlabelled buttons
MISC--: each sample presented randomly selected outcome taken underlying outcome distribution same structure problems presented description format
MISC--: participants were free sample often any order they liked until they were ready select one option play real
OWNX--: strikingly participants playing this experienced based choice task tended make decisions opposite four fold pattern choice
MISC--: example only number percent participants preferred certain number decision above
MISC--: this apparent description experience gap led some call development separate distinct theories risky choice citation
MISC--: fox hadar citation however argued this conclusion unwarranted light reanalysis hertwig et al data
MISC--: specifically they found prospect theory could satisfactorily account patterns choice when based participants experienced distribution outcomes due sampling errors was often different objective distribution sampled outcomes derived
MISC--: crux debate centres relative importance sampling bias
MISC--: this issue led investigators employ number creative designs produced conflicting results citation
