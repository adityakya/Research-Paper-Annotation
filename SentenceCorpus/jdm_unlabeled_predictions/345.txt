MISC--: recognition heuristic citation suggests when applicable probabilistic inferences based noncompensatory examination whether object recognized not
MISC--: overall findings processes underlie this fast frugal heuristic somewhat mixed many studies expressed need considering more compensatory integration recognition information
CONT--: regardless mechanism involved clear recognition strong influence choices this finding might explained fact recognition cues arouse affect thus receive more attention than cognitive cues
OWNX--: test this assumption we investigated whether recognition results direct affective signal measuring physiological arousal i e peripheral arterial tone established city size task
OWNX--: we found recognition cities does not directly result increased physiological arousal
MISC--: moreover results show physiological arousal increased increasing inconsistency between recognition information additional cue information
MISC--: findings support predictions derived compensatory parallel constraint satisfaction model rather than predictions noncompensatory models
MISC--: additional results concerning confidence ratings response times choice proportions further demonstrated recognition information other cognitive cues integrated compensatory manner
MISC--: imagine business trip city you never visited before
MISC--: your meetings end later than you had expected you decide spend night
MISC--: you make few phone calls find two hotels vacancies both at similar rate
MISC--: you know nothing else about hotels however you do recognize name one them
MISC--: hotel would you choose
MISC--: according goldstein gigerenzer citation kinds probabilistic inferences could resolved recognition information alone
MISC--: more specifically according gigerenzer colleagues citation individuals equipped several tools i e fast frugal heuristics exploit structure environment some rely solely one piece information at time road reaching decision
MISC--: recognition heuristic rh simplest one most prototypical tools this toolbox suggests probabilistic inferences about specific criterion e g two cities more populated made basis recognition alone so recognized objects e g name city will chosen over unrecognized ones
MISC--: indeed been shown repeatedly people actually prefer recognized objects over unrecognized ones behavior may lead rather accurate inferences citation
MISC--: nevertheless several studies challenge claim recognition information used noncompensatory manner predicted rh citation
MISC--: example oppenheimer citation broder eichler citation richter spath citation additional information been found affect proportion choices followed recognition
MISC--: while been argued several studies suffer methodological limitations citation their findings nonetheless highlight need considering more compensatory integration recognition information
MISC--: moreover studies rh focused mainly choice behavior
MISC--: yet since choice predictions made different models often overlap citation difficult draw clear conclusions concerning underlying cognitive processes
MISC--: several recent studies attempted address this problem example testing hypotheses concerning process measures decision time citation additionally investigating confidence glockner broder press
MISC--: yet additional research needed disentangle role recognition information decision making well examine cognitive processes underlying its use inferences choice behavior
MISC--: achieve goals we investigated nature processes underlying use recognition information probabilistic inferences using physiological arousal choice proportions decision times confidence dependent measures
OWNX--: we derived concurring predictions basis noncompensatory perspective juxtapose contradicting predictions derived compensatory model
OWNX--: specifically we investigate whether recognition leads increased physiological arousal dominates other cognitive information suggested affect based noncompensatory models citation
MISC--: been argued recognition information like other affective signals might generated automatically citation may override cognitive information citation
OWNX--: thus we examined whether recognition information affectively encoded during decision process
OWNX--: we tested rh against compensatory parallel constraint satisfaction pcs model decision making citation
MISC--: pcs model was selected because been shown account well decision times citation confidence glockner broder press recognition tasks because makes specific predictions concerning physiological arousal
MISC--: pcs model assumes information integration based automatic intuitive processes akin perception citation consistent interpretations decision tasks constructed
MISC--: available information taken into account according its importance advantages emerging preferred option highlighted systematic information distortions citation
MISC--: formalized pcs model includes four possible steps
MISC--: first when presented decision task related information activated form mental representation task
MISC--: second automatic processes pcs lead maximization consistency automatically highlighting information supporting favored alternative at same time suppressing contradicting information
MISC--: result consistent representation available information formed
MISC--: third decision maker evaluates choice alternatives if one alternative clearly dominates other i e if there enough information favor this alternative this alternative chosen
MISC--: however if information consistency fails reach certain threshold decision maker takes forth step deliberate construction processes activated change structure network e g changing pattern information search assigning different weights different pieces information
MISC--: among other things pcs model supported research shows unconscious modifications available information occur during decision processes citation
