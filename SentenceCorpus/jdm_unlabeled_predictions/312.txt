MISC--: when people learn make decisions experience reasonable intuition additional relevant information should improve their performance
OWNX--: contrast we find additional information about foregone rewards i e what could gained at each point making different choice severely hinders participants ability repeatedly make choices maximize long term gains
OWNX--: we conclude foregone reward information accentuates local superiority short term options e g consumption consequently biases choice away productive long term options e g exercise
MISC--: conclusions consistent standard reinforcement learning mechanism processes information about experienced forgone rewards
OWNX--: contrast related contributions using delay gratification paradigms we do not posit separate top down emotion driven systems explain performance
OWNX--: we find individual group data well characterized single reinforcement learning mechanism combines information about experienced foregone rewards
MISC--: when immediate temptations conflict long term aspirations immediate temptations often prevail important goals remain unfulfilled citation
MISC--: failures self control well documented behavioral domains diverse dieting smoking interpersonal conflict citation
MISC--: ability forego small immediate rewards order receive larger future rewards viewed hallmark effective self control both humans animals citation
MISC--: this report we examine impact information about foregone fictive outcomes human decision making behavior situations short long term rewards conflict
MISC--: forgone outcomes counterfactual rewards could been obtained had one made alternate choices
OWNX--: our task captures aspects real world tasks people face repeated choices outcomes determined past choices well current choices
MISC--: classic study self control children mischel shoda rodriguez citation found preschoolers ability forego immediate gratification e g one cookie immediately order attain more valuable eventual outcomes e g two cookies after brief delay predictive number key competencies adolescence
MISC--: several studies suggest most effective strategy delaying gratification directing one s attention away reward related stimuli during waiting period citation
MISC--: specifically children who direct their attention away smaller immediate reward better able forego short term gains allowing them maximize long term gains
MISC--: hot cool systems framework citation one popular theory performance delay gratification studies
MISC--: according this theory one s level self control dictated interacting hot cool systems
MISC--: hot system fast emotionally driven automatically triggered reward related stimuli
MISC--: contrast cool system slow reflective top down goal driven
OWNX--: interplay between two systems either undermine support one s efforts delay gratification
MISC--: external e g whether immediate reward visible internal factors e g whether one s attention focused immediate reward accentuate immediate rewards activate hot system
MISC--: immediate rewards become more salient one becomes more likely succumb control hot system lead failure delay gratification
MISC--: one criticism previous self control studies they involve explicit tradeoffs intertemporal options do not occur real life situations citation
MISC--: paradigms participants told explicitly when larger delayed rewards will received
MISC--: real world people rarely given explicit information about long term consequences immediate actions citation
MISC--: example consider conflict between short long term goals facing executive expanding firm
OWNX--: at each choice point executive elect continue investing new equipment training thus increasing firm s future output boosting long term profits executive instead cut costs order boost short term profits thus deferring future benefits new investment
MISC--: executive s choices effectively influence state environment affects future returns
MISC--: here precise long term consequences executive s choices not known until future time points
OWNX--: long term optimal choice must some extent learned experientially through interactive exploration decision space citation our example corresponds observing increasing returns resulting continued investment equipment training
MISC--: present work examines optimal long term choice behavior dynamic task recurring choices providing more realistic representation many short long term tradeoffs daily life
MISC--: whereas explicit tradeoff paradigm treats choices static one shot decisions many real world decisions often informed past outcomes one s current situation determined past choices citation
MISC--: notably experimental paradigm proposed herrnstein colleagues citation affords examination individuals ability maximize long term rewards dynamic choice environments
MISC--: consider task reward structure depicted figure number
MISC--: horizontal axis represents current state decision environment whereas vertical axis represents reward selecting either choice
OWNX--: every state one option we refer short term option always yields higher immediate reward than other option we refer long term option
MISC--: state environment defined number long term choices made over last ten trials
MISC--: making larger proportion long term choices over time moves current state environment rightwards horizontal axis thus increasing rewards both choices
MISC--: effectually choices yield larger immediate rewards negatively affect future rewards analogous cutting costs above example whereas options less immediately attractive lead larger future rewards analogous continuing investment new equipment training
OWNX--: this dynamic choice environment maximizing long term i e global rewards requires forgoing larger immediate i e local rewards guaranteed short term option continually making long term choices
MISC--: growing literature examined factors bear decision maker s ability learn reward maximizing choice strategy similar environments citation
MISC--: this report we consider dynamic decision making tasks people learn about rewards resulting both chosen unchosen i e foregone options
MISC--: example executive may able both observe actual result further investment calculate hypothetical cost savings would resulted suspending investment
MISC--: although neural substrates signal representing foregone rewards distinct directly experienced rewards been identified both humans citation primates citation unclear how reward signals combine shape behavior
MISC--: behavioral research human decision making yielded some insight into how knowledge foregone rewards affect choice behavior
MISC--: settings where rewards change over time foregone rewards support optimal choice when chasing foregone rewards advantageous likewise hinder optimal choice when chasing foregone rewards disadvantageous
MISC--: further sensitivity foregone rewards appears diminish over time repeated choice settings citation
MISC--: present work extends this research dynamic decision making environments
MISC--: unlike static tasks been used examine effects foregone rewards information rewards performing actions dynamic tasks contingent upon past choice behavior
MISC--: namely rewards present trial determined one s recent history choices
OWNX--: we consider particular form sequential dependency short long term rewards conflict
OWNX--: this task strategy maximizing long term rewards not obvious decision maker at outset
MISC--: thus computational challenge arises described greater detail below crediting past decisions indirectly led better worse rewards present
OWNX--: we hypothesize when short long term rewards conflict foregone rewards accentuate local superiority short term option e g cutting costs consequently bias choice away long term option e g investment equipment training
MISC--: our predictions dynamic decision tasks consistent findings delay gratification studies find focusing attention away short term reward increases likelihood exercising self control gain delayed but larger reward citation
OWNX--: investigate this possibility we manipulate information presented about foregone rewards after each choice laboratory task outlined above see figure number
OWNX--: example after long term choice participant might shown number points were actually earned well number points could been earned had participant made short term choice
MISC--: our hypothesis forgone information will accentuate short term option s larger immediate payoff discourage exploration decision space leading behavior suboptimal long run
OWNX--: foreshadow our results we find inclusion more information i e about forgone payoffs makes less likely decision maker will maximize long term returns
MISC--: this result surprising surface anticipated standard reinforcement learning citation mechanism single information processing stream opposed separate hot cool systems citation
MISC--: according hot cool systems view citation accentuating greater immediate rewards associated short term option should increase hot system s control over choice leading consistent selection globally inferior short term option
MISC--: rl mechanism explains this result without recourse two systems different computational properties
MISC--: rl models learn their interactions environment maximize gains making use reward signal provides information about goodness actions
MISC--: this framework been used model human decision making behavior citation well firing patterns dopaminergic neurons primates citation
OWNX--: our rl model demonstrates weighting fictive i e forgone reward signal action not taken impedes exploration decision space because tasks where short long term rewards conflict adequate exploration necessary reach optimal choice strategy
OWNX--: absence specialized hot cool components this associative account provides simple account choice behavior this related tasks
OWNX--: rule out effect foregone rewards does not arise confusion stemming additional information citation but rather arises highlighting local superiority short term option we include additional condition specious foregone rewards provided
OWNX--: we sought manipulation would demonstrate foregone reward information systematically biases choice does not merely overload participants information hindering optimal choice behavior
OWNX--: demonstrate this we employ control condition termed false foregone rewards false fr
OWNX--: this condition when short term option chosen foregone rewards long term option appear greater than experienced rewards order promote belief long term option locally superior
MISC--: likewise when long term option chosen foregone rewards short term option appear smaller than experienced reward order promote belief short term option locally inferior
OWNX--: link real world example this manipulation akin college student telling friend who spent night studying at library party they had foregone was actually fun was boring
MISC--: short actual feedback chosen option veridical but information about forgone option favors long term option locally
MISC--: if additional information about forgone rewards does not confuse participants we should find participants provided specious information about forgone rewards should make more optimal choices than participants not provided foregone rewards
MISC--: other words we predict more less when local information emphasizes short term gains but more more when local information emphasizes long term gains
