MISC--: auctions normally considered devices facilitating trade also provide way probe mechanisms governing one s valuation some good action
MISC--: one most intriguing phenomena auction behavior winner s curse strong tendency participants bid more than rational agent theory prescribes often at significant loss
OWNX--: prevailing explanation suggests humans limited cognitive abilities make estimating correct bid difficult if not impossible
OWNX--: using series auction structures we found bidding approaches rational agent predictions when participants compete against computer
MISC--: however winner s curse appears when participants compete against other humans even when cognitive demands correct bidding strategy removed
MISC--: results suggest humans assign significant future value victories over human but not over computer opponents even though victories may incur immediate losses this valuation anomaly origin apparently irrational behavior
OWNX--: auctions various types constitute ubiquitous mechanism buying selling items limited quantity availability
MISC--: given commonality auctions noteworthy under fairly general conditions even highly experienced bidders tend suffer net losses citation
OWNX--: this fact come called winner s curse was first identified auctions drilling rights gulf mexico citation
MISC--: phenomenon since been reported range other field settings citation well laboratory studies citation
MISC--: experiments shown naive bidders initially incur large losses decline over time but curse nonetheless persists even very experienced citation professional citation auction participants
MISC--: winner s curse arises auctions items fixed but unknown value known common value auctions
MISC--: oil drilling rights satisfy conditions because amount oil region hence its market value same all bidders yet cannot precisely estimated
MISC--: understand source winner s curse begin assuming estimates value each bidder correct average some amount variance
MISC--: if participants bid their estimated value winner auction will participant most optimistic estimate
MISC--: since estimates distributed around true value most optimistic estimate will generally overestimate true value net loss will therefore occur bidder
MISC--: hence average winner cursed statistical fact their estimate more likely than not greater than true value
MISC--: avoid winner s curse necessary modify one s bid beyond one s estimate true value account conditional probability winning auction
MISC--: good bid ought sufficiently less than one s estimate order acknowledge fact winning most likely occur overestimate
MISC--: practice auction participants do modify their bids strategically but correction not sufficient avoid winner s curse citation
MISC--: there been several proposed mechanisms winner s curse citation
MISC--: explanations generally propose bidders fail perform rationally due cognitive limitations citation
MISC--: hypothesis people understand they must submit bids less than their estimates but they unable accurately calculate exactly how much less bid
OWNX--: this study we examine this hypothesis find no support
OWNX--: we first present data demonstrating winner s curse not consequence limited cognitive abilities
OWNX--: we then demonstrate curse depends instead social nature auction environment
MISC--: previous work psychology auctions demonstrated social influences significant effect bidding
MISC--: escalating auctions participants bid sequentially until single high bidder remains people subject intense emotions impede rationalization may lead extremely high bids citation
MISC--: this phenomenon known auction fever likely related winner s curse according our thesis
MISC--: winner s curse previously thought entirely separate phenomenon because uncertainty inherent common value auctions presumably make cognitive demands overwhelming citation
MISC--: additionally our experiments social environment minimal
MISC--: each participant submits sealed bid essentially isolation highest submitted bid wins leaving no opportunity competitive fire escalate progression auction
OWNX--: our findings address both points
MISC--: first despite challenges posed lack information common value auctions people able converge stable bidding strategies less than number trials remain constant when cognitive demands eliminated
OWNX--: second we find winner s curse fact strongly dependent social context
