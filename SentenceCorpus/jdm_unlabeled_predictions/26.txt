OWNX--: this paper proposes revised version original domain specific risk taking dospert scale developed weber blais betz citation shorter applicable broader range ages cultures educational levels
MISC--: also provides french translation revised scale
OWNX--: using multilevel modeling we investigated risk return relationship between apparent risk taking risk perception number risk domains
OWNX--: results replicate previously noted differences reported degree risk taking risk perception at mean level analysis
MISC--: multilevel modeling shows more interestingly within participants variation risk taking across number content domains scale was about number times large between participants variation
OWNX--: we discuss implications our findings terms person situation debate related risk attitude stable trait
MISC--: people differ way they resolve decisions involving risk uncertainty differences often described differences risk attitude
MISC--: expected utility framework its variants including prospect theory citation apparent differences risk attitude modeled utility functions differ shape different degrees concavity convexity explain risk aversion seeking
MISC--: risk attitude parameter differentiates between utility functions different individuals citation intended nothing more than descriptive label concavity convexity utility function
MISC--: popular interpretations risk attitude however often consider personality trait citation
MISC--: consideration risk attitude personality trait undergone similar development personality traits general
MISC--: while traits were initially defined stable i e situation invariant personality characteristics citation were assumed result biological differences early childhood experiences citation empirical observation low correlations between trait related behavior different situations given rise more complex definitions acknowledge situational determinants behavior while preserving generality way personality traits shape pattern behavior across situations citation
OWNX--: following two observations been problematic simple expected utility definition risk attitude personality trait
MISC--: first different methods measuring people s utility functions thus risk attitudes been shown result different classifications individuals citation
MISC--: more importantly even when using same assessment method individuals not shown themselves consistently risk seeking averse across different domains situations both laboratory studies citation managerial contexts
MISC--: maccrimmon wehrung citation showed example managers different risk attitudes when making decisions involving personal versus company money when evaluating financial versus recreational risks
MISC--: problems limit predictive validity expected utility based assessments risk attitude
MISC--: given lability expected utility based assessments risk attitude should not surprising measurement scales based upon them not had much success predicting people s choices behaviors across range situations citation
MISC--: observed content specificity responses suggests they should not combined across content domains
MISC--: nevertheless choice dilemma questionnaire citation commonly used scale asks people probability equivalents twelve choice dilemmas different domains life then combined into single score purportedly represents person s risk attitude
OWNX--: despite its obvious deficiencies scale still use primarily lack better alternatives
MISC--: some researchers recently argued risk attitude may more usefully conceptualized risk return framework risky choice imported finance example capital asset pricing model citation its variants generalizations citation
MISC--: psychological risk return models treat perceived riskiness variable differ between individuals function content context citation
OWNX--: they decompose observed behavior i e apparent risk taking into evaluation benefits risks well trade off between perceived benefits perceived risks person specific willingness trade off units returns units risk i e attitude towards perceived risk assumed relatively stable across situations domains citation
OWNX--: this provides multiple ways characteristics decision maker situation affect choices under risk
MISC--: apparent risk taking same person two situations might differ example because decision maker perceives risks benefits differ magnitude two domains e g recreational vs financial decision while his her attitude towards perceived risk basically same both domains citation
MISC--: empirical investigations shown systematic individual group cultural differences perceptions riskiness risky choice options citation
MISC--: smaller number studies also documented group differences perception perceived benefits citation
MISC--: after accounting differences perception risk returns choice alternatives however people s perceived risk attitudedefined their willingness trade off units perceived risk units perceived returnhas shown considerable cross group cross situational consistency citation
MISC--: domain specificity risk taking thus seems arise primarily differences perception risks possibly benefits choice alternatives different content domains while trait true attitude towards risk shows consistency across situations lies evaluation risk perceived something either desirable i e worth giving up units return undesirable i e something needs compensated units return citation
MISC--: decision domains respondents shown different degrees risk taking different perceptions risks benefits include gambling financial investing business decisions personal decisions citation
MISC--: personal decisions broken down into smaller categories differ associated goals concerns citation health safety e g seatbelt usage smoking social e g confronting one s coworkers family members ethical decisions e g cheating exam terminating comatose family member s life support
MISC--: one expect find differences perception risks benefits different domains decisions because decisions domains score differently psychological risk dimensions e g dread familiarity controllability identified slovic fischhoff lichtenstein citation known affect risk perception
MISC--: affective reactions risk different domains differ result factors differential familiarity controllability
MISC--: given recent evidence about prominence affective reactions perceptions risk citation individual domain differences subjective perceptions riskiness should not come surprise
MISC--: based insights about diverse set determinants decisions under risk weber blais betz citation developed risk taking scale domain specific risk taking dospert scale allows researchers practitioners assess both conventional risk attitudes defined reported level risk taking perceived risk attitudes defined willingness engage risky activity function its perceived riskiness five commonly encountered content domains i e ethical financial further decomposed into gambling investment health safety social recreational decisions
MISC--: scale been used validated its factor structure replicated wide range settings populations see
MISC--: addition adequate internal consistency reliability estimates weber et al citation reported moderate test retest reliability estimates provided evidence factorial convergent discriminant validity scores respect constructs sensation seeking dispositional risk taking intolerance ambiguity social desirability
OWNX--: construct validity was also assessed via correlations results risky gambling task well tests gender differences
OWNX--: further evidence dospert scale s construct validity was provided zuniga bouzas citation who found scores health safety recreational risk taking subscales significantly predicted estimated blood alcohol concentrations mexican high school students
OWNX--: also hanoch johnson wilke citation used dospert scale show individuals selected exhibit high levels risk taking one content area e g bungee jumpers taking recreational risks quite risk averse other risky domains e g financial decisions
MISC--: recent review large number instruments measure risk propensity healthcare decisions citation describes dospert scale one three relevant clinical environment they directly measure risk propensity across number everyday situations including propensity take health related risks p number
MISC--: dospert scale additionally commended its simultaneous measurement multiple risk constructs risk taking risk perception perceived risk attitude
MISC--: weber et al citation also used dospert scale provide evidence psychological risk return model risky choice
OWNX--: they found given participant level apparent risk taking varied across risk domains yet his her domain specific levels perceived risk benefits together explained significant proportion this variability great majority respondents relationship between apparent risk taking risk perception across domains was negative neutral suggesting perceived risk aversion
MISC--: johnson et al citation obtained similar findings at aggregate mean level across respondents sample young german adults
CONT--: facilitate use dospert scale broader range applied settings current paper provides revision original scale weber et al citation had been developed validated american college undergraduates
MISC--: revised scale both shorter i e number vs number items applicable respondents broader set age groups cultures educational levels
OWNX--: revised dospert scale was administered groups english french speaking north americans doing do we also contributed french translation scale literature
MISC--: although dospert scale been translated into several languages german italian dutch spanish validated cultures speaking languages citation french version was not available yet
MISC--: explained above endorse risk return approach assessing apparent risk taking presupposes involvement various determinants perceptions benefits risk well more stable component represents person s propensity favor shy away option he she perceives being risky referred person s perceived risk attitude citation
AIMX--: unfortunately present study perceptions benefits could not collected due time constraints so focus here exclusively apparent risk taking perceived risk perceived risk attitude
AIMX--: more specifically we hypothesize following derived primarily risk return model risky choice including cross cultural comparisons citation work weber et al citation number there exists considerable variability apparent risk taking within between individuals number more importantly controlling perceived risk at within individuals i e domain level results significant reduction this variability allows within individuals consistency perceived risk attitude number individuals perceived risk averse neutral across both cultures even though risk perception risk taking possibly degree perceived risk aversion may differ between cultures
BASE--: while our goal replicate extend findings reported weber et al citation we taking very different analytic approach using multilevel modeling investigate relationship between apparent risk taking perception
OWNX--: our knowledge first time this technique used context psychological risk return models risky choice study domain specificity apparent risk taking general
MISC--: one compelling reasons using multilevel modeling allows decomposition total variance risk taking into various components quantification explanation both within between individuals variation apparent risk taking
