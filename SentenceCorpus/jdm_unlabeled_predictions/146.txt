MISC--: whereas much literature exists choice overload less known about effects numbers alternatives donation decisions
OWNX--: we hypothesize donations increase number recipients albeit at decreasing rate reflect donors knowledge recipients
MISC--: donations involve different concepts fairness equity equality interact numbers alternatives
MISC--: two experiments respondents indicated how they would donate lottery winnings number euros
OWNX--: results showed first more was donated non governmental organizations campaigns respondents knew better
MISC--: second total donations increased number recipients albeit at decreasing rate
CONT--: third when limited giving only one multiple alternatives donors gave less than when this restriction did not apply
MISC--: fourth variability donations both increase decrease number potential recipients
OWNX--: we comment theoretical practical implications well suggesting issues future research
MISC--: recently much literature highlighted importance numbers alternatives choice
MISC--: this considered two perspectives
MISC--: one investigators reported effects when people make unique selections different numbers alternatives citation
MISC--: example studies documented differential satisfaction choice decisions involving pens citation pension plans citation gift boxes citation wines citation
MISC--: moreover recent meta analysis suggests magnitude effects depends preconditions choice moderators contexts decisions made citation
MISC--: focus second perspective what happens when people allocate resources across different numbers alternatives citation
AIMX--: this topic present paper
OWNX--: specifically we consider this issue context charitable donations investigate effects numbers alternatives amount total donations well their distribution across charitable organizations ngos non governmental organizations specific campaigns
MISC--: both issues important theoretical practical viewpoints
MISC--: example when attempting maximize donations ngos might consider whether donors perceive them belonging small large subsets potential recipients
MISC--: at same time ngos often seek funds different campaigns important know how number presentation campaigns affect total donations
OWNX--: we report two experiments
OWNX--: first we explore effects when donors allocate funds across different numbers ngos
OWNX--: second we investigate what happens when single ngo solicits contributions different numbers campaigns
OWNX--: short we find two effects increasing number alternatives total contributions increase albeit at decreasing rate distributions donations affected
MISC--: specifically tend become less egalitarian case ngos but more so case campaigns
OWNX--: second experiment we also investigate use drop down menus donation interfaces soliciting donations specific campaigns
MISC--: when current practice choice limited one several alternatives contributions lower than when this restriction does not apply
