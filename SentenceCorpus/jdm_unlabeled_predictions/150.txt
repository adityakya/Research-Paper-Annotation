MISC--: recent studies identified uncertainty effect ue whereby risky prospects e g binary lottery offers either number number gift certificate valued less than their worst possible outcome number certificate
MISC--: this effect been proposed result direct risk aversion posits mere uncertainty lottery directly decreases its value
MISC--: however this effect may also driven potential disappointment inherent not receiving better two outcomes disappointment aversion mere fact risky prospect referred lottery
OWNX--: results two experiments do not support either two alternatives
OWNX--: specifically results experiment number indicate ue observed even when values two lottery outcomes similar even identical
OWNX--: experiment number further replicates ue context word lottery never used company promotional
MISC--: results consistent direct risk aversion mechanism citation suggest ue obtains across number different contexts
MISC--: recent studies identified following peculiar effect individuals willing pay significantly less binary lottery offers either number number gift certificate equal probability than they number gift certificate alone citation
MISC--: this uncertainty effect ue not only counterintuitive also presents important challenge current theories risk aversion arrive at risk aversion indirectly through shape utility function predict risky prospects should valued no lower than value their worst possible outcome citation
MISC--: indeed although disutility gambling been alluded literature generally been avoided formal models because implies unpalatable patterns violation internality citation
OWNX--: first paper demonstrate ue citation did so across number different contexts both hypothetical real suggesting this effect does not arise incidental features particular paradigm
MISC--: specifically ue was replicated non monetary outcomes e g number minutes one willing work boring task studies using choice rather than willingness pay wtp e g number sure vs number number lottery offering either number number gift certificate real world situations actual goods
MISC--: ruling out number plausible alternative explanations authors interpret ue resulting direct risk aversion mechanism posits uncertainty per se directly decreases utility risky prospects
MISC--: other words mere uncertainty about outcome one will receive makes lottery less valuable
MISC--: support direct risk aversion mechanism simonsohn citation built original finding gneezy et al citation ruling out two additional alternative explanations ue
OWNX--: first simonsohn citation found ue was observed even when participants certainty condition number sure were aware better outcome number rules out possibility mere awareness better outcome may devalue worse one
OWNX--: second he demonstrated majority participants understood instructions ue was not caused few who did not rules out possibility this effect observed simply because participants misunderstand task citation
MISC--: this basis simonsohn citation similarly concluded aversion uncertainty per se i e direct risk aversion likely responsible ue
CONT--: there however at least two remaining alternative explanations ue been unaddressed previous research
MISC--: first involves disappointment aversion people may value lotteries less because potential disappointment inherent not receiving better two outcomes citation
MISC--: example number won lottery may seem worse than number guaranteed because individual knows they did not receive number
MISC--: thus ue may result discrepancy values between better worse outcomes rather than uncertainty lottery itself
MISC--: this alternative explanation distinguished experimentally direct risk aversion mechanism manipulating value better outcome
MISC--: according bell s citation loomes sugden s citation models disappointment amount disappointment should zero when both outcomes equivalent increase monotonically their difference
MISC--: consequently if ue driven anticipated disappointment inherent not receiving better two outcomes citation this effect should eliminated at least attenuated when lottery outcomes equivalent their perceived value e g lottery one two bookstore gift certificates each worth number
MISC--: if however ue arises solely mere uncertainty about outcome one will receive then effect should persist despite equivalent values
OWNX--: this alternative was examined experiment number
MISC--: second plausible explanation ue may participants willing pay less lottery because they just general aversion term lottery
OWNX--: this might case because some people consider activities immoral against their beliefs citation
MISC--: moreover lotteries state lotto typically low probability gambles expected value less than price entry into lottery
MISC--: result participants may suspicious term lottery because real world offers typically signal prospects negative expected value
