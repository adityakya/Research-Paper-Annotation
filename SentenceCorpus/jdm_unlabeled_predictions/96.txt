MISC--: indecisiveness individual difference measure chronic difficulty delay decision making
MISC--: indecisiveness associated low decisional confidence distinct patterns pre choice information search behavior
MISC--: present study explored whether confidence levels search behaviors associated individual indecisiveness also emerge group decision making contexts
OWNX--: this study number decisive indecisive participants were assigned make decision individually homogenous three person group
MISC--: indecisiveness score was found predict participant decisional confidence individual condition but not group condition group participants being overall more confident than individuals
OWNX--: similar results were obtained other related measures participants perceptions decision task
OWNX--: surprisingly no indecisiveness related differences information search were found suggesting other aspects group process contribute increased confidence
OWNX--: results provide initial evidence indecisiveness does not influence group decision making especially indecisive individuals working groups may way boost decisional confidence
MISC--: indecisiveness individual difference measure associated chronic difficulty delay decision making citation
MISC--: self report descriptors include taking long time decide not knowing how decide feeling uncertain during decision making avoiding decisions changing ones mind regretting decisions citation
MISC--: given tendencies indecisive individuals appear poorly adapted many tasks citation important goal identify circumstances indecisiveness likely compromise effective decision making
MISC--: present research motivated question whether relationship between indecisiveness patterns decision making informational search contexts observed individuals extends groups
OWNX--: introduction we first review past empirical work establishing relationship between indecisiveness decisional confidence informational search patterns
OWNX--: we then motivate our interest exploring relationships group decision making context integrate relevant group literature
OWNX--: finally we present empirical study relationship between indecisiveness patterns decision making individuals versus small groups
