AIMX--: purpose present study was investigate effect perceived time pressure learning based task called iowa gambling task igt
OWNX--: one hundred sixty three participants were randomly assigned one two groups
MISC--: experimental group was informed time allotted was typically insufficient learn successfully complete task
MISC--: control group was informed time allotted was typically sufficient learn successfully complete task
MISC--: both groups completed igt performance was recorded
MISC--: major finding was participants who were advised amount time allotted was typically insufficient complete task performed significantly worse than those who were advised time was typically sufficient complete task
MISC--: research shows real time constraints adversely influence igt performance citation
CONT--: there remains need however determine how perceived time pressure affects igt decision making
CONT--: essence igt performance impaired real time constraints simply perception time constraints
