MISC--: across many real world domains men engage more risky behaviors than do women
MISC--: examine some beliefs preferences underlie this difference number participants assessed their likelihood engaging various risky activities relating four different domains gambling health recreation social reported their perceptions number probability negative outcomes number severity potential negative outcomes number enjoyment expected risky activities
MISC--: women s greater perceived likelihood negative outcomes lesser expectation enjoyment partially mediated their lower propensity toward risky choices gambling recreation health domains
MISC--: perceptions severity potential outcomes was partial mediator gambling health domains
OWNX--: genders did not differ their propensity towards taking social risks
OWNX--: fifth domain activities associated high potential payoffs fixed minor costs was also assessed
MISC--: contrast other domains women reported being more likely engage behaviors this domain
MISC--: this gender difference was partially mediated women s more optimistic judgments probability good outcomes outcomes being more intensely positive
MISC--: accidents very frequent cause death particularly among young adults teenagers u s center disease control cdc citation men more often victims accidents than women citation
MISC--: example every number number us drivers men three times likely women involved fatal car accidents citation
MISC--: while some this well known difference automobile death rates probably reflects differences average amount time men women spend driving seems likely another important cause males voluntarily engage risky behaviors more often than do females
MISC--: example us women report usually using seat belts substantially more often than men citation men been shown run yellow lights more often than women citation
MISC--: furthermore similar differences seen wide variety other forms accident statistics
MISC--: male pedestrians uk involved accidents about number percent more often than female pedestrians men die much more often drowning accidental poisoning throughout western world citation
MISC--: thus there seems little doubt men must engaging more risky behaviors across broad range domains
OWNX--: despite its obvious practical importance some key aspects psychological underpinnings gender differences risk taking not been examined
MISC--: present article seeks shed new light underpinnings asking substantial sample college men women report various perceptions preferences related wide range risk taking scenarios
CONT--: existence gender differences propensity take risks been documented large number questionnaire experimental studies
MISC--: example meta analysis byrnes miller schafer citation reviewed over number papers gender differences risk perception
MISC--: they concluded literature clearly indicated male participants more likely take risks than female participants p number
MISC--: recent work begun examine generality cognitive underpinnings differences greater detail citation
MISC--: one important study provides backdrop present investigation weber blais betz citation assessed risks men women perceived behaviors spanning five different content domains financial health safety recreational ethical social decisions
MISC--: gender differences were found four five domainssocial decision making being exceptionwith males perceiving less risk indicating greater likelihood engaging risky behaviors
MISC--: similar gender differences been found domains large german sample citation
MISC--: across studies social domain unique either no gender differences found when they found women who report greater propensity engage risky behaviors perceive overall greater benefit less risk doing so citation
MISC--: interest authors also found great variability individual s willingness engage risk across domains suggesting risk taking not simply product some general personality trait promotes risk seeking
MISC--: instead individual group differences substantially due differing perceptions risk different domains
MISC--: most part previous research relied unitary subject defined notion risk e g how risky behavior situation
MISC--: 
OWNX--: number researchers examined role various affect dimensions determining overall perceptions riskiness
MISC--: slovic citation proposes several psychological risk dimensions including dread control knowledge contribute perceived riskiness
MISC--: follow up research shown material well emotional factors also impact overall risk judgments citation
MISC--: any global assessment perceived risk combines elements belief how likely something bad will happen
MISC--: subjective valuation outcome how bad would
MISC--: 
MISC--: thus common parlance given behavior might said riskier than another behavior if former more severe potential consequences if higher risk potential negative consequences both
MISC--: example leaving one s bike unattended day busy city bungie jumping could both described risky behaviors yet probabilities potential bad outcomes enormously different two cases
MISC--: past research shows decomposing elements shed important light individual group differences responses risky situations
MISC--: gurmankin levy baron citation had subjects assess badness unfortunate medical outcomes associated defined probability e g number percent chance loss big toe
OWNX--: different groups men vs women physicians vs non physicians were differentially sensitive probability against severity
MISC--: present article pursues similar approach explore determinants men s women s willingness engage different risky activities
MISC--: note field finance where distribution potential outcomes obviously continuous risk often conceptualized variability returns offered choice
MISC--: following approach some theorists found useful conceive people s generalized risk preferences terms how this variability affects individual s disposition choose option citation
MISC--: while this seems quite reasonable many real world risky choice scenarios e g riding motorcycle without helmet not using sunscreen etc
MISC--: would seem reasonable simplification view potential negative outcomes unitary event having probability some degree un desirability
AIMX--: this approach will followed here although general discussion we will point out potential follow up work would consider risks involving more than single discrete negative outcome
MISC--: remarkably literature adults does not seem contain any studies seek decompose perceptions risk involved real world risky behaviors order determine whether genders differ their evaluations likelihoods costs negative outcomes
MISC--: number plausible hypotheses immediately present themselves
MISC--: one hypothesis women do not evaluate probability negative outcomes differently than men they simply assume perhaps rightly perhaps not they would more emotionally upset harmed negative outcomes should occur
MISC--: alternatively one may hypothesize women assess greater probability unfavorable outcomes without projecting any stronger negative reactions outcomes than do men
MISC--: while studies gender effects adult risk preferenceswith exception gurmankin levy baron citation not addressed this issue there one study within developmental literature explored this question
MISC--: hillier morrongiello citation examined gender differences perceptions involved physical risk taking children
MISC--: using pictorial descriptions e g riding bicycle no helmet street interview determine how children assessed risks they found girls appraised more general risk i e judged situations more unsafe than boys
MISC--: genders also differed factors contributed their overall risk judgments
OWNX--: boys risk judgments were significantly predicted their ratings injury severity while girls risk judgments were better predicted their ratings vulnerability any type injury
MISC--: this suggests girls may avoid risky situations any likelihood perceived injury boys may avoid risky situations only if possible perceived injuries judged being severe
MISC--: noted above literature adults not examined whether genders differ their evaluations number likelihood potential negative outcomes number their appraisals severity potential outcomes
MISC--: adults either both aspects risk may mediate gender differences engaging risky behaviors
MISC--: third factor may also responsible gender differences propensity engage risky behaviors genders may differ their estimates enjoyment offered activity assuming negative outcomes do not take place
MISC--: this last possibility finds some support weber et al citation johnson et al number who found relative women men judged they would obtain greater benefits engaging risky behaviors all domains except social
MISC--: using risk return framework weber colleagues suggested risky decision making seen trade off between fear risk hope expected returns
AIMX--: present study had two major goals
OWNX--: first was separately assess gender differences three kinds assessments just mentioned
MISC--: put simple terms present study asks do women tend example engage dangerous recreational activities less often because they think likelihood injury greater b they think severity injury were occur would greater c because they simply do not find positive aspects activities attractive men do
OWNX--: addition we examined whether assessments vary depending upon domain behavior compared patterns risk perception individuals reports engaging risky behaviors past
OWNX--: second aim was explore important category choices popularly referred taking chance not our knowledge been examined previous studies individual differences risk decisions engage not engage behaviors offer small probability large positive reward return some small but certain cost
MISC--: example trying number th caller radio station order win large sum money
OWNX--: this type scenario will referred positive domain
MISC--: one possible explanation why women engage fewer risky activities they relatively pessimistic feel themselves relatively unlucky i e prone experience least desirable possible outcome more often than would expected based overall frequencies
MISC--: if this so then women should also show less interest than men options offering low probability positive reward
MISC--: another possibility women see low frequency outcomes whether good bad more likely occur cases they should show greater attraction choices positive domain
