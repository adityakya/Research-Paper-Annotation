MISC--: research judgment decision making generally ignores distinction between factual subjective feelings ownership tacitly assuming two correspond closely
OWNX--: present research suggests this assumption might usefully reexamined
OWNX--: two experiments endowment effect we examine role subjective ownership independently manipulating factual ownership i e what participants were told about ownership physical possession object
MISC--: this allowed us disentangle effects two factors typically confounded
OWNX--: we found significant effect possession but not factual ownership monetary valuation object
OWNX--: moreover this effect was mediated participants feelings ownership were enhanced physical possession object
OWNX--: thus endowment effect did not rely factual ownership per se but was result subjective feelings ownership induced possession object
MISC--: feelings ownership appeared lead individuals include object into their endowment shift their reference point accordingly
MISC--: potential implications directions future research discussed
MISC--: thaler citation presented half students class cornell university coffee mugs then allowed them trade their less fortunate classmates
MISC--: surprisingly little trading occurred
MISC--: those holding mugs set their minimum selling prices too high those without mugs set their maximum offers too low many trades clear
MISC--: apparently briefly owning coffee mug raised its value owner sufficiently price beyond reach most non owners
MISC--: thaler coined term endowment effect describe result goods included one s endowmentthat goods one ownsare valued more highly than identical goods not held endowment
MISC--: non owner s potential gain acquisition was apparently smaller than owner s potential loss sale
MISC--: effect since been widely replicated citation
MISC--: endowment effect commonly interpreted result loss aversion core ingredient prospect theory citation
MISC--: losses outcomes below some reference point weighted substantially more than gains outcomes above reference point evaluation choice options citation
MISC--: if one initially owns object prospect losing seen relatively large loss
MISC--: if one does not prospect acquiring seen relatively small gain
CONT--: hence small volume trading thaler s study endowment shifted reference points thus assessment what loss what gain
MISC--: more recently researchers started examine more detail psychological mechanisms driving effect
MISC--: example strahilevitz loewenstein citation found valuation object increase duration ownership possibly due increased adaptation psychological accustoming new material situation
MISC--: novemsky kahneman citation present evidence loss aversion thus endowment effect found goods owned consumption but not goods owned exchange thus given up intended rather than losses endowment
MISC--: carmon ariely citation report findings suggesting endowment effects explained result buyers sellers having different cognitive perspectives exchange
MISC--: results suggest there more endowment effect than simple factual ownership object
OWNX--: present research we try elucidate further what leads development sense endowment subsequently higher monetary valuations
MISC--: concept ownership one s endowment goods appears involve two elements legal entitlement subjective ownership
MISC--: elements may imperfectly correlated
MISC--: one may feel some sense ownership items one does not own e g borrowed bicycle behave owner might e g resenting owner s demand its return
MISC--: conversely one may feel little ownership items one does fact own e g newly bought computer require some period experience use before feeling full ownership
MISC--: pierce kostova dirks citation propose elaborate psychological model based extensive literature review antecedents experiences consequences psychological subjective ownership citation
MISC--: this research suggests subjective feelings ownership more complex than simple legal entitlement citation
MISC--: pierce et al model feelings ownership induced controlling entity e g through possession becoming familiar e g through actual imagined use investing self into e g through identification
MISC--: thaler citation most studies endowment effect two elements ownership confounded
MISC--: seems clear students who received mugs understood they legally owned them could if they wished sell them others
MISC--: they also were given physical possession mugs could inspect control them
MISC--: extent elements led feelings subjective ownership unclear
MISC--: possession alone even absence factual ownership induce feelings ownership citation
MISC--: indeed because immediate control provides over entity possession might more psychologically salient stronger effect feelings ownership object thus its monetary evaluation than does factual ownership citation
OWNX--: following two experiments we examine relative contributions factual subjective ownership endowment effect separately manipulating factual ownership possession object
MISC--: this design allows examining whether endowment effect driven factual ownership number possession number both
OWNX--: we expect possession will induce stronger feelings ownership than pure factual ownership
OWNX--: we arguing this subjective sense endowmentrather than legal entitlementthat leads shift reference point makes not having object feel like loss rather than foregone gain
OWNX--: result possession will lead higher monetary evaluation whereas factual ownership itself will not
