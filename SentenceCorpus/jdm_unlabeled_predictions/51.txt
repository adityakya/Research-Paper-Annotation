MISC--: markets asymmetric information only sellers knowledge about quality goods
MISC--: sellers may course make declaration quality but unless there sanctions imposed false declarations reputations at stake declarations tantamount cheap talk
AIMX--: nonetheless experimental study we find most people make honest declarations line recent findings lies damaging another party costly terms liar s utility
OWNX--: moreover we find this experimental market deceptive sellers offer lower prices than honest sellers could possibly explained same wish limit damage other party
OWNX--: however when recipient offer social tie we find no evidence lower prices deceptive offers seems indicate rationale lower price deceptive offers strangers fact profit seeking making deal more attractive rather than moral
MISC--: market said asymmetric information if only sellers know quality goods
MISC--: george akerlof s citation famous game theoretic paper market lemons showed given certain conditions good quality would driven out markets information asymmetries
MISC--: experimental studies support this basic argument citation
MISC--: core features traditional market lemons model quality prices goods
CONT--: high quality goods assumed more valuable sellers buyers alike but only sellers know quality at time sale
MISC--: order any deception take place sellers must also able make quality declaration true false
MISC--: if no reputation building other sanctions possible declarations considered cheap talk usually discarded irrelevant game theory citation
MISC--: effect standard game theory everyone supposed lie if they benefit doing so
OWNX--: archetypical example market lemons market used cars
MISC--: however uri gneezy citation points out empirical departure theoretical prediction he then suggests buyers often place sufficient trust private sellers honesty because many private sellers actually prefer honest
MISC--: indeed many experimental studies found most subjects usually do not take advantage possibility deceive another party citation
MISC--: studies also identify several moderators decision whether deceive particular gneezy citation found deception less likely occur more damages other party
OWNX--: we will think this moral cost deception
AIMX--: here we present novel experimental study deception price market lemons
CONT--: far we know there been no previous study deceptive declarations quality markets
OWNX--: our first aim establish also this context most subjects will tend honest
OWNX--: said differently we expect most subjects who advertise peach will actually sell peach not lemon
OWNX--: our second main aim study relationship between deception pricing
MISC--: market where sellers set prices no gain made deception unless seller actually charges more good when buyer believes high quality
AIMX--: this pricing aspect no counterpart gneezy s study where subjects only chose whether honest deceive
OWNX--: our experiment gadget sellers compete buyers both declared quality price
MISC--: at first glance may seem unreasonable honest deceptive sellers deviate price they offer since gadgets indistinguishable buyers at time purchase
OWNX--: however we will discuss immediately below there several reasons why deceptive sellers might charge less
MISC--: terminology wolinsky citation higher price signals higher quality
OWNX--: hence our second question whether sellers our market employ price signaling
MISC--: why would deceptive sellers charge less
OWNX--: following gneezy liars concerned damage their deception causes buyers might want compensate offering lower price let us call this mechanism moral price signaling
MISC--: alternative mechanism rational price signaling profit maximizing sellers who believe most buyers prefer buy lower priced goods would actually charge less when deceptive than when honest
OWNX--: reason possibility higher price relatively less attractive seller who does not bear cost parting high quality
MISC--: difficult distinguish between two mechanisms within same market framework
OWNX--: our approach let sellers make offers both strangers friends
MISC--: rationale this comes research sociology social psychology showing information asymmetries lead strong preferences socially embedded transactions part buyers since friends more trusted behave honestly citation
OWNX--: therefore seller who gives offer friend regardless price relatively certain this offer will not rejected out distrust
MISC--: consequently rational price signaling would not expected between friends whereas moral price signaling would if anything more accentuated between friends
MISC--: our third question thus whether price signaling dependent whether offers made social ties strangers
OWNX--: cross national experiment outlined section follow was designed answer questions
OWNX--: we collected data sellers well buyers
MISC--: latter data allow us investigate buyers preferences over prices social embeddedness
OWNX--: particular we want ascertain buyers tend prefer lower priced offers unless offer friend
