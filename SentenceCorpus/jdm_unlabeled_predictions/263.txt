OWNX--: measuring reaction times number comparisons thought reveal processing stage elementary numerical cognition linked internal imprecise representations number magnitudes
MISC--: intuitive representations mental number line been demonstrated across species human development but been little explored decision making
AIMX--: this paper develops tests hypotheses about influence evolutionarily ancient intuitive numbers human decisions
OWNX--: we demonstrate individuals more precise mental number line representations higher numeracy number skills consistent previous research children
MISC--: individuals more precise representations compared those less precise representations also were more likely choose larger later amounts over smaller immediate amounts particularly larger proportional difference between two monetary outcomes
MISC--: addition they were more likely choose option larger proportional but smaller absolute difference compared those less precise representations
OWNX--: results consistent intuitive number representations underlying perceived differences between numbers b extent proportional differences weighed decisions ultimately c valuation decision options
MISC--: human decision processes involving numbers important health financial matters may rooted elementary biological processes shared other species
MISC--: intuitive representations mental number line defined nonverbal representations numerosity spontaneously activated presence numeric information regardless format citation
MISC--: representations inner marks allow verbal nonverbal animals think unnamed numbers citation
MISC--: trained monkeys example order objects number number their numerosity citation
MISC--: adult humans perform arithmetic operations quickly larger arrays dots using nonverbal mental magnitudes citation
MISC--: number domain prime example where strong evidence points biologically determined domain specific representation number elementary arithmetic operations linked inferior parietal cortex specifically horizontal intra parietal sulcus both adults children citation
MISC--: arabic spelled out spoken numerals all activate this area so thought involved cross modal abstract representation manipulation quantity meaning numbers rather than being activated any specific number notation citation
MISC--: numerical cognition researchers believe this basic numerical intuition lays foundation uniquely human mathematical reasoning citation
CONT--: number intuitions however limited their representational power do not directly support concepts fractions probabilities even precise numbers important many decisions
MISC--: although little research exists processing more sophisticated concepts thought based nonetheless humans basic number sense brain areas originally developed other purposes co opted nonintuitive symbolic number processing
AIMX--: goal this paper develop test hypotheses about influence evolutionarily ancient intuitive numbers human decisions
MISC--: numerical information ubiquitous decisions guide our lives generally assumed if provided appropriate numbers people will numerate enough understand use them intended
MISC--: less numerate individuals however fare less well important medical financial decisions involving numeric information citation
