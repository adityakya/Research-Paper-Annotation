MISC--: endowment effect been debated over number years
MISC--: recent research suggests differential focus attention might play role shaping preferences
OWNX--: two studies we investigated role biased attention emergence endowment effects
OWNX--: we thereby derive predictions extended version evidence accumulation models additionally assuming bias attentional allocation based one s endowment status
OWNX--: we test predictions against alternative account endowment effect result initial anchoring adjustment differences citation
OWNX--: both studies we add deliberation time constraints standard willingness accept willingness pay paradigm consistently find endowment effect grows deliberation time increases
MISC--: study number we additionally use eye tracking find buyers focus more value decreasing attributes than sellers vice versa value increasing attributes
MISC--: this shift attention plays pivotal role construction value partially mediates endowment effect
MISC--: one major goals behavioral decision making research improve our understanding processes underlying judgments decisions
MISC--: what now considered classic work fundamental biases judgment choice systematic deviations rational behavior been demonstrated citation
MISC--: recent research focus shifted towards investigations underlying cognitive processes driving effects citation
OWNX--: way information attended used construct preferences values increasingly become primary interest citation
MISC--: one effect been studied great detail across variety domains endowment effect violates one cornerstones economic theory
MISC--: basic assumption coase theorem citation persons willingness pay wtp willingness accept wta good should nearly equivalent under assumption zero transaction costs
MISC--: nevertheless repeatedly been shown wta good considerably higher than wtp same good leading reduced trading
MISC--: this effect appears related aspects losing endowment thus been coined endowment effect citation
MISC--: endowment effect robust although culturally influenced citation phenomenon citation been observed using various methodological approaches including non incentivized price estimations citation also incentive compatible preference elicitation mechanisms citation
MISC--: been found occur both tangible goods mugs pens citation goods uncertain values lottery tickets citation
MISC--: although there no dearth research endowment effect more work needed understand underlying processes still under heavy debate citation
MISC--: several theories been put forward provide explanation endowment effect citation
MISC--: classic explanation based prospect theory citation assumes loss aversion leads increased valuation good selling perspective compared buying perspective because removing good endowment creates loss while adding same good endowment without generates gain citation
MISC--: research expanded loss aversion explanation citation indicating mechanisms differences attentional focus citation level personal attachment citation self association good question citation also explain parts effect citation
MISC--: cognitive mechanisms often been suggested alternative supplementary explanations classic loss aversion account
MISC--: carmon ariely citation example argue endowment effect caused stronger focus forgone differs between buyers i e money sellers i e good
MISC--: query theory qt citation suggests different process behind effect transactional situations information retrieved memory
MISC--: individuals start memory query aspects support status quo e g keeping good vs money weighted heavier than later queries also act inhibit subsequent queries information speaks against status quo
MISC--: several experiments johnson colleagues citation showed order queries into good s worth were influenced perspective could explain endowment effects
MISC--: furthermore manipulating query order they found endowment effect was attenuated non significance suggesting strong role information search uptake endowment effect
MISC--: line qt account nayakankuppam mishra citation showed sellers appear better representation positive features worse representation negative features traded good compared buyers
MISC--: p number both groups spontaneously list more features favor their position citation
MISC--: nevertheless because its reliance memory retrieval inhibition processes qt does not make direct predictions decision tasks relevant information about good question e g attributes probabilities outcomes make up gamble provided during valuation construction phase
MISC--: based findings nayakankuppam mishra citation however one might predict description based decisions there should similar imbalance attention well
OWNX--: following we will refer application concepts qt tasks description based query theory dbqt
MISC--: one class process models explain emergence endowment effects both kinds tasks i e decisions descriptions memory evidence accumulation approaches
MISC--: particular sequential value matching model citation extension decision field theory citation been developed model process constructing monetary valuations objects understood gambles e g lottery tickets risky prospects
MISC--: conceptually svm model assumes persons compare gamble against set possible prices dynamic stochastic process
OWNX--: first persons pick one possible price anywhere between maximum minimum outcome gamble
MISC--: if gamble worth more than currently considered price price increased small amount
MISC--: if gamble worth less price decreased small amount
MISC--: this updating process repeated until indifference reached
MISC--: starting point search process differs different price elicitation methods context conditions
OWNX--: specifically sellers start high price whereas buyers start low price
MISC--: over time both prices adjusted towards price middle price range
OWNX--: this adjustment middle insufficient however results well established disparity between wta wtp
MISC--: svm model been shown explain several specific phenomena related disparity between wta wtp
MISC--: most notably account observed preference reversals citation classic loss aversion explanation cannot accommodate citation
MISC--: furthermore svm model been shown able qualitatively quantitatively predict choices observed previous studies well decision times process tracing data citation
MISC--: svm model readily account endowment effects without assumption biased attention assuming differential starting points e g anchoring within feasible price range buyers sellers sellers starting higher range than buyersrecent studies however indicate decisions descriptions attention both reflects modulates preferences citation
MISC--: this suggests place top mechanisms suggested svm model there likely shifts attention positive value increasing vs negative value decreasing aspects option based one s perspective leading overweighting aspects resulting pricing differences found endowment effect
OWNX--: adding this assumption biased shift attention based one s perspective we formulate set related hypotheses biased evidence accumulation bea hypotheses
MISC--: if biased sampling based perspective i e bea contributing factor endowment effects difference between wta wtp should increase over time because constant heavily weighted earlier bias sampling increases absolute difference between sum pro con arguments considered good
CONT--: this should case at least early stage decision process while prices still being adjusted price search not yet been completed
OWNX--: this forms our first specific bea hypothesis h number growing endowment effect hypothesis
MISC--: due bias accumulating evidence disparity between wta wtp will increase increases deliberation time
MISC--: if contrast endowment effects driven solely differential anchoring adjustment suggested svm citation increased deliberation time should instead lead decreases size endowment effects pricing adjustments presumably will average go down sellers up buyers
OWNX--: this hypothesis provides us our alternative prediction study number
AIMX--: using eye tracking methodologies study number we test directly whether attentional focus influenced perspective whether this affects valuations our second third bea hypotheses
MISC--: h number biased sampling hypothesis
MISC--: sampling evidence will differ based perspective buyers will focus more value decreasing attributes than sellers
MISC--: h number attentional impact hypothesis
MISC--: sampling evidence biased towards either value increasing decreasing attribute will lead corresponding increases decreases valuations
OWNX--: additionally we explore whether allocation attention dependent probabilities outcomes predicted evidence accumulation mechanism general also central svm model citation our fourth bea hypothesis
MISC--: h number probability based sampling hypothesis
MISC--: sampling outcomes will part dependent stated probability those outcomes occurring
OWNX--: furthermore although qt memory based account we abstract dbqt apply two its underlying information processing concepts i e query direction switches deliberations continue early queries greater impact than later queries online information queries via attention we test two further bea hypotheses study number
OWNX--: we do so based finding visual attention been found reflect internal processing online information well memories citation
MISC--: h number shift focus hypothesis
MISC--: buyers will begin accumulate more value decreasing sellers more value increasing evidence but there will increased focus opposite kind information over time
MISC--: h number early weighting hypothesis
MISC--: earlier accumulated evidence will greater impact subsequent valuations than will later evidence
OWNX--: following we present discuss results two studies
OWNX--: study number we find wta wtp disparity grows increasing deliberation time predicted our first specific bea hypothesis but counter prediction svm model
