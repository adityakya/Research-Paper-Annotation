MISC--: individual true error theory assumes responses same person same choice problem within block trials based same true preferences but may show preference reversals due random error
MISC--: between blocks person s true preferences may differ stay same
MISC--: this theory illustrated studies testing two critical properties distinguish models risky decision making number restricted branch independence implied original prospect theory violated specific way both cumulative prospect theory priority heuristic number stochastic dominance implied cumulative prospect theory
MISC--: corrected random error most individuals systematically violated stochastic dominance ruling out cumulative prospect theory
MISC--: furthermore most people violated restricted branch independence opposite way predicted theory priority heuristic
OWNX--: both violations consistent transfer attention exchange model
MISC--: no one was found whose data were compatible cumulative prospect theory except those were also compatible expected utility no one satisfied priority heuristic
MISC--: when offered choice different individuals express different preferences
MISC--: example given choice between number sure fifty fifty gamble win either number number some people choose sure cash others prefer gamble
MISC--: when same person presented same choice problem two occasions individual may give two different responses
MISC--: given two phenomena between within person variability possible part all what called individual differences may actually attributable variability instability choice behavior
MISC--: furthermore when we test structural properties theories apparent violations theory may due instability responses rather than true flaws theory
AIMX--: therefore study individual differences we need separate true differences between people differences might due variation within person
OWNX--: furthermore study behavioral properties theories we need determine whether violations real might instead attributed instability response
MISC--: this report investigates two critical properties distinguish models risky decision making first order stochastic dominance sd restricted branch independence rbi
MISC--: we apply individual true error theory itet permits separation random variability true violations models risky decision making
