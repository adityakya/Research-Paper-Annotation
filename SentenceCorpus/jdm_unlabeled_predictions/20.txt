AIMX--: this paper i trace evolution aircraft cockpit example transformation probabilistic environment into ecological hybrid environment characterized both probabilistic deterministic features elements
MISC--: hybrid ecology relationships among correspondence coherence strategies goals cognitive tactics continuum intuition analysis become critically important
MISC--: intuitive tactics used achieve correspondence physical world do not work electronic world
OWNX--: rather i make case judgment decision making hybrid ecology requires coherence primary strategy achieve correspondence this process requires shift tactics intuition toward analysis
OWNX--: we live correspondence driven world actual state world imposes constraints interactions within citation
OWNX--: correspondence driven domains judgments how far away how high obstacle
OWNX--: what correct diagnosis given symptoms
MISC--: where enemy force likely attack
OWNX--: guided multiple probabilistic fallible indicators physical world
OWNX--: survival depends correspondence accuracy our judgment how well corresponds objective reality
MISC--: increasing availability sophisticated technological systems however profoundly altered character many correspondence driven environments aviation medicine military operations nuclear power well processes judgments decision making within them
AIMX--: this paper i trace evolution aircraft cockpit example transformation probabilistic environment into ecological hybrid environment characterized both probabilistic deterministic features elements
MISC--: technology changed nature cues information available pilot also changed strategies tactics pilots must use make judgments successfully
OWNX--: i make case judgment decision making hybrid ecology requires coherence primary strategy achieve correspondence this process requires shift tactics intuition toward analysis
MISC--: recognition changes carries implications research models high technology environments well design systems decision aids
