MISC--: although many models risky choices between gambles assume information somehow integrated recently proposed priority heuristic ph claims choices based one piece information only
MISC--: although current reason choice according ph vary all other reasons claimed ignored
OWNX--: however choices predicted ph other pieces information often confounded thus rendering critical tests whether decisions actually based one reason only impossible
MISC--: current study aims remedy this problem manipulating number reasons additionally line choice implied ph
OWNX--: results show participants choices decision times depend heavily number reasons line ph thus contradicting notion non compensatory one reason decision making
MISC--: adaptive toolbox metaphor put forward gigerenzer co workers citation implies decision makers possess use collection simple rules thumb so called fast frugal heuristics achieve very good results very little effort
MISC--: since was originally formulated toolbox been rapidly growing new heuristics introduced almost regularly
MISC--: despite broder s citation criticism inventing more more new heuristics may soon become futile if they not seriously tested empirically p number adaptive toolbox was recently extended preferential decisions means priority heuristic citation simple lexicographic rule choices between gambles
CONT--: although idea adaptive decision making choice itself not novel citation ph represents new development this area
MISC--: brandstatter et al citation concluded ph outperforms both normative other heuristic models predicting participants choices
MISC--: also they claim represents process model choice describing sequence steps taken decision maker s cognitive apparatus
MISC--: both claims been seriously questioned substantial debates about properties ph citation more generally plausibility fast frugal heuristics approach citation arisen
OWNX--: one serious caveat studies investigating ph lies selection gambles used choice predicted ph gamble favored other pieces information often confounded
CONT--: thus adherence rates ph modal choices studied brandstatter et al citation might biased measures whether participants decisions truly based one reason only claimed ph
AIMX--: current study aims remedy this problem
MISC--: first choice rule ph will introduced along description problem confounded information gamble pairs
