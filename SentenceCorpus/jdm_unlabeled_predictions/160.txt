OWNX--: using college student samples two studies were conducted validate chinese version domain specific risk taking dospert scale
MISC--: results replicated important findings reported weber et al citation chinese culture
OWNX--: risk taking risk perception were domain specific whereas perceived risk attitudes were relatively stable across domains supporting risk return model risk taking
OWNX--: results both exploratory factor analysis efa confirmatory factor analysis cfa showed ethical recreational health safety gambling domains were preserved chinese version dospert items social investment domains formed one factor
MISC--: this result may explained weber hsee s citation cushion hypothesis
OWNX--: other possible reasons this cross cultural difference factor structure were also discussed
MISC--: significant past research been conducted understand people s differences their risk taking behaviors often referred differences risk attitude
MISC--: according expected utility theory citation prospect theory citation risk attitude explained shape utility function
MISC--: this model risk attitude individual s location continuum risk aversion risk seeking assumed personality trait citation
MISC--: based this single trait view risk attitude researchers employed various methods measure
OWNX--: some studies require participants choose between lotteries then compare participants observed choices choices predicted expected value citation
MISC--: using probability equivalence method kogan wallach citation developed choice dilemma questionnaire asking respondents probability equivalents twelve choice dilemmas combined into single score represents risk attitude
MISC--: nonetheless according blais weber citation studies were questionable due two major problems
MISC--: firstly people may classified risk seeking risk averse depending method employed measure risk attitude citation
MISC--: secondly even same method may categorize individual into different groups across different situations domains citation
MISC--: problems suggest those measurements do not possess satisfactory predictive validity across range situations citation
MISC--: given this obvious deficiency many risk attitude measurements recently some researchers claimed risk attitude should conceptualized risk return framework risky choice treated domain specific manner citation
OWNX--: risk return models assume risk taking reflect tradeoff between perceived risk fear expected return hope citation risk taking preference x expected benefit x b perceived risk x c where represents marginal effect expected benefit x risk taking preference b represents marginal effect perceived risk x risk taking preference c error term
MISC--: researchers found systematic situational group differences perceived risk expected benefit risky behaviors citation
MISC--: nevertheless people s perceived risk attitude coefficient b remains relatively stable across situations groups citation
MISC--: therefore differences perceived risk expected return risky choices seem play major part observed domain specificity risk attitude citation
MISC--: this risk return framework weber et al citation developed domain specific risk taking dospert scale order assess both conventional risk attitudes apparent risk taking i e risk taking preference formula above perceived risk attitudes six domains namely social recreational gambling investment health safety ethical decisions
MISC--: conventional risk attitudes defined people s stated level risk taking perceived risk attitude defined willingness engage risky behavior function its perceived risk citation
AIMX--: therefore dospert scale measures both individuals propensity engage risk activities their perceived risk expected return activities making possible study relationship between apparent risk taking risk perception thus perceived risk attitude
AIMX--: using this scale weber et al citation demonstrated participants degree risk taking differed across domains differences were primarily associated differences perceived risk expected return risky behaviors rather than differences perceived risk attitude
OWNX--: results provided strong support risk return model risky choice
MISC--: researchers provided strong evidence dospert scale s reliability validity citation
MISC--: weber et al citation reported its initial psychometric properties including moderate reliability estimates satisfactory construct validity convergent discriminant validity respect constructs sensation seeking intolerance ambiguity social desirability
MISC--: geographically dospert been validated many other cultures german dutch italian spanish citation
MISC--: nonetheless date scale not been tested eastern cultures
MISC--: mentioned above items six content domains dospert were originally developed validated u s since substantial cultural differences exist between western societies eastern societies there need examine its psychometric properties eastern culture
AIMX--: therefore order further examine cross cultural validity dospert current paper validated scale chinese culture using university students china
OWNX--: this process we looked similarities differences risk taking function culture then discuss possible explanations observed differences
OWNX--: specifically we conducted two studies address issues
OWNX--: simplicity sake we will refer our translated revised version scale dospert c
AIMX--: study number we attempted identify factor structure dospert c using exploratory factor analytic procedure
OWNX--: moreover we examined reliability dospert c
OWNX--: we also performed regression examine relationship between risk perception risk behavior
OWNX--: mentioned above risk return framework assumes involvement various determinants namely perceived risk expected benefit perceived risk attitude
OWNX--: however because logistical constraints expected benefit could not collected present study
AIMX--: thus this study s emphasis conventional risk attitudes perception risk perceived risk attitude
OWNX--: study number order provide further empirical support factor structure dospert c we conducted confimatory factor analysis
