AIMX--: we propose constructed choice model general decision making
MISC--: model departs utility theory prospect theory its treatment multiple goals suggests several different ways context affect choice
MISC--: particularly instructive apply this model protective decisions often puzzling
MISC--: among other anomalies people insure against non catastrophic events underinsure against catastrophic risks allow extraneous factors influence insurance purchases other protective decisions
MISC--: neither expected utility theory nor prospect theory explain anomalies satisfactorily
OWNX--: apply this model above anomalies we consider many different insurance related goals organized taxonomy we consider effects context goals resources plans decision rules
AIMX--: paper concludes suggesting some prescriptions improving individual decision making respect protective measures
OWNX--: concept goal aim motive purpose etc
MISC--: been long been taken granted many accounts human behavior
OWNX--: behavior attributed aims goals everyday discourse he wore his best suit order make good first impression literature epics novels etc
MISC--: scientific discourse example widely differing accounts aristotle s ethics circa number b c e
MISC--: william james s principles psychology citation kurt lewin s dynamic theory personality citation
MISC--: despite obviousness wide use goal concepts dominant tradition economics decision sciences emphasized utility value basis choice
MISC--: particular goals viewed ways increasing utility happiness
MISC--: utility thought sort common currency integrates multiple goals multiple quantitative attributes outcomes
MISC--: this standpoint tradeoffs among goals attempts maximize utility
MISC--: view all goals contribute single common currency was clearly enunciated plato symposium
OWNX--: he used metaphor weighing different pleasures pains balance
OWNX--: this view central plato s thought underlying his theories education government
MISC--: studies mathematics science metaphysics needed educate skillful weigher who must integrate across different goals across near distant times
MISC--: similar views dominated utilitarian thought number th number th centuries included integration value across individuals society well different goals times e g
MISC--: bentham number
OWNX--: aristotle s ethics contrast partially disagreed emphasizing multiple goods stating way different goals fit together should vary occasion
OWNX--: aristotle perhaps read advocating situation dependent integration multiple goals idea we pursue elaborate this paper
MISC--: despite this hint aristotle plato s concept single common currency serves integrate value across myriad goals largely held sway both general psychology decision science
MISC--: freud s concept libido citation beebe center s hedonic tone citation hull s concept generalized drive citation work reward systems brain citation diener s seligman s concepts general happiness citation all suggest some general quality linked many different goals
MISC--: exception keeney citation who advocates decision analysis focus separate goals values starting point rather than goal tradeoffs represented overall utility
MISC--: decision science concept maximization linked closely mapping onto single dimension utility
MISC--: bounded set real numbers limiting maximum but there no natural total ordering sets vectors two more dimensions therefore no natural concept maximization
MISC--: fact total ordering fundamental most foundational theories decision science citation
MISC--: idea all human goods weighed same balance fascinating scientific hypothesis been worth pursuing determine extent its applicability ways fails
MISC--: translating many goods into one dimensional currency fits well human thought processes especially analog mental models citation
MISC--: unidimensionality opens way application powerful mathematical methods computing approximating maxima citation
AIMX--: this paper we pursue more aristotelian theory decision making where preferences constructed based decision context citation decision maker focuses goals rather than maximizing happiness utility
AIMX--: we attempt show this alternative approach leads new explanations how people make choices raises novel questions respect descriptive theories behavior prescriptive guidelines aiding decision maker improving choices
OWNX--: our title implies theory we present about goals plans
MISC--: many plansgoing out movie embarking shopping trip purchasing insurance invasion iraq united statesare were selected view achieving several different goals at once
MISC--: shopping trip paradigmatic because often involves several discrete stops each one more goals but evening at movie may simultaneously satisfy goals companionship emotional visual stimulation keeping up current culture
MISC--: insurance plans often aimed both at financial goals at emotional goals peace mind
OWNX--: we will discuss multiple goals insurance other protective plans detail below
MISC--: accord miller galanter pribram citation we regard plan fundamental structural unit decision theory
OWNX--: we do not consider each tiny muscle movement each phoneme utterance choice
OWNX--: rather decision theory offers explanations only at behavioral level where someone consciously unconsciously considers what goals will accomplished various possible plans what plan designed will likely achieve several important goals
MISC--: past research plans unearthed various areas cognitive science
MISC--: area motor control particularly rich evidence unconscious higher level programs governing sequences skilled movements citation
MISC--: interest movement planning very explicit robotics citation
MISC--: planning sporadically been considered other theories human artificial intelligence
MISC--: one major virtues considering goals plans together individual decision making brought into close analogy organizational decision making
MISC--: latter goals plans shared among individuals groups select implement plans
MISC--: new railroad bridge advertising campaign goals plans their perceived relationship made explicit often recorded
MISC--: individual decision goals plans their perceived relationship hidden within person s conscious unconscious cognitions emotions but one try nonetheless gather data provide some information about processes
MISC--: this stance also requires us distinguish between goals resources
MISC--: plans draw resources achieve goals
MISC--: some resources money favors owed accumulated sometimes accumulation resource may itself become goal
MISC--: we nonetheless continue distinguish example between money considered resource same money considered goal
AIMX--: main concern our paper protective decision making
OWNX--: much focus even narrower we consider insurance decisions at length
OWNX--: theory we offer much more broadly applicable
OWNX--: however we found narrower focus useful theory development
MISC--: there many apparent anomalies insurance decisions individuals households
MISC--: classical utility theory supposed account decision making under risk especially insurance purchase
MISC--: was not obvious us initially goal plan approach would do better than utility theory its popular alternative prospect theory
OWNX--: applying multiple goal theory this domain been both challenging enlightening compared more obvious examples shopping trips movie excursions
OWNX--: discussing insurance choices we start idea insurance designed principally device share financial risk situations where many at risk but relatively few actually suffer financial loss
MISC--: many cases easy share financial risk but difficult if not impossible share other risks
MISC--: having one s home burn down example extremely stressful even if nobody hurt
MISC--: stress may persist considerable period time
MISC--: stress induced suffering cannot readily shared others not directly affected fire although social practices exist ease
MISC--: what most easily shared financial risk
OWNX--: each household at risk pays relatively small amount insurance premium participate this risk sharing
MISC--: when participant s home does burn down insurer pays contracted amount cover some cost rebuilding purchasing replacement home
MISC--: instead few cases where victims suffer catastrophic financial loss everyone at risk bears much smaller financial payment
MISC--: insurance premiums must large enough aggregate cover not only total insured financial losses but also costs insurer risk sharing effort
MISC--: thus premiums unless subsidized usually exceed average losses
MISC--: common sense terms standard economic theory people willing pay more than expected loss because they risk averse
MISC--: paying premium does not lower overall utility happiness level significantly but suffering large financial loss would result very large drop utility happiness
MISC--: this ratio utility changes much greater than inverse probability incurring loss thus suggesting individuals purchase insurance so maximize their expected utility
MISC--: financial standpoint anomalies arise when consumer choices respect insurance sometimes appear suboptimal given reasonable degrees risk aversion
MISC--: example common people pay added premiums seem excessive obtain automobile collision insurance low rather than high deductible requires them pay initial portion loss
MISC--: make matters worse some decide not file claim following small accident whose cost could largely reimbursed via this low deductible they fear claim would lead increased premiums next succeeding years they prefer avoid incurring transaction costs involved settling claim their insurer
MISC--: higher deductible would saved individuals money before accident avoided costs associated deciding whether not file claim
MISC--: rather different example emerged after passage national flood insurance program nfip number
OWNX--: insurance coverage against water damage flooding was offered both homeowners commercial enterprises high hazard areas at subsidized low rates
MISC--: yet there was limited interest purchasing this coverage despite subsidy despite potential catastrophic losses citation
MISC--: third example many people prepared pay considerably more insure possessions they find very attractive than insure possessions toward they feel neutral negative citation
MISC--: if possession needed then must replaced after loss damage
OWNX--: replacement cost remains same independent one s positive negative feelings toward object
MISC--: since insurance offers exactly claims payment hard justify financially paying more insuring attractive than less attractive object
AIMX--: remainder paper organized following manner
OWNX--: we next section number discuss types insurance anomaly illustrated preceding three examples suggest psychological processes related goals might account each type
MISC--: section number presents elements quantitative theory constructed choice based goals plans decision weights contrasts this theory standard theory expected utility maximization
OWNX--: section number presents taxonomy insurance related goals
OWNX--: section number draws this taxonomy explain insurance anomalies terms our constructed choice theory
OWNX--: this section also probes failings utility theory prospect theory respect characterizing insurance decisions
OWNX--: paper concludes section number set prescriptive implications concerning protective activities based our theory decision making
