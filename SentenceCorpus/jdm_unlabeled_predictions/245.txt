MISC--: people prefer their own initials other letters influencing preferences many domains
MISC--: name letter effect citation may not apply negatively valenced targets if people motivated downplay distance themselves negative targets associated self previous research shown citation
MISC--: current research we examine relationship between same initial preferences negatively valenced stimuli
OWNX--: specifically we examined donations disaster relief after seven major hurricanes test influence name letter effect negatively valenced targets
MISC--: individuals who shared initial hurricane name were overrepresented among hurricane relief donors relative baseline distribution initials donor population
MISC--: this finding suggests people may seek ameliorate negative effects disaster when there shared characteristics between disaster self
MISC--: katrina petrillo raised number hurricane katrina victims selling lemonade citation
MISC--: when asked why she said i realized my name going go down history one biggest storms ever citation
MISC--: current research explores whether katrina petrillo s response association between hurricane katrina her name might more likely than what would expected chance
OWNX--: specifically we predict donors who share initial disaster will more likely donate disaster relief efforts particular disaster than would individuals who do not share initial disaster
MISC--: prediction individuals who share initial disaster will more likely donate fundraising efforts targeted at disaster consistent research demonstrated people prefer initial their first name over other letters
MISC--: this preference called name letter effect citation reflected both subjective ratings initials citation choices same initial targets over comparable targets different initials citation
MISC--: shared initials been shown influence choices numerous domains including product preferences donations political candidates spouses occupations citation
MISC--: example one study found people names beginning letter d overrepresented profession dentists people names beginning letter l overrepresented population lawyers citation
MISC--: similarly people named george more likely live georgia than expected chance people named louise more likely live louisiana citation
MISC--: together findings indicate similarities affect judgment choice presumably creating unit relation citation facilitates assimilation positive feelings self into representation target citation
MISC--: psychologists theoretically assumed people should avoid associations negative stimuli citation
MISC--: this claim based several studies shown people cut off reflected failure citation close others order protect ego
MISC--: example people less likely wear clothing displaying logos sports teams recently lost game compared teams recently won game citation
MISC--: similarly snyder colleagues citation randomly assigned groups college students receive positive negative false feedback group task
MISC--: they found compared no feedback control successful group demonstrated more affiliative tendencies while failure group demonstrated less afilliative tendencies
MISC--: under other circumstances individuals may downplay negative features target they share unit relationship
MISC--: finch cialdini citation found subjects who believed they shared birthday rasputin rated him less negatively after reading description his misdeeds than those who did not
MISC--: recent study nelson simmons citation extended this work demonstrating pairing initial negative outcome undermines task performance
MISC--: specifically they found people whose first names begin c d initials lower gpas than people other initials baseball players k initials letter used represent strikes baseball more likely strike out than players other initials presumably because people tend downplay severity negative outcome much they downplay rasputin s deeds when they think he shares their birthday
MISC--: other words people first names begin c d may implicitly downplay severity getting lower grades consequently dampen efforts perform well
MISC--: extending research implicit egotism negative stimuli we contend people may not always minimize their associations negative stimuli citation downplay their negativity citation
MISC--: clearly katrina petrillo understood negative impact hurricane katrina
MISC--: she claimed sharing her name severe storm motivated her help its victims
MISC--: if she minimized her association storm unlikely she would attend common initial consequently would feel no more motivated donate money than anyone else
MISC--: similarly if she downplayed severity storm unlikely she would mention worst storm history invest so much time raising money
MISC--: this case again unlikely she would so compelled donate given previous research suggesting people less likely donate less severe disasters citation
MISC--: katrina petrillo s efforts raise money victims hurricane katrina contrary both processes outline above well self enhancement literature general
MISC--: citation however there circumstances when people may not avoid their association negative targets may even make reparations actions others whom they share association
MISC--: example people will endorse compensatory behavior right wrongs committed their ingroup against outgroup citation even if this compensatory behavior comes at personal cost self
MISC--: doosje colleagues citation found this phenomena was mediated feelings collective guilt suggesting responsibility like positive affect transfer between members unit relation
MISC--: if group membership increases likelihood compensatory behavior actions other group members then perhaps other kinds unit relations do same
MISC--: taken together previous literatures self target associations allow us speculate katrina petrillo s sentiment towards victims hurricane katrina may shared others
MISC--: shared initials capable producing unit relation there at least some evidence unit relation target inflicts harm lead people help their victims
MISC--: this led us expect people would i more likely donate money same initial disasters possibly ii donate more money same initial disasters
