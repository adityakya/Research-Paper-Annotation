OWNX--: we investigated role individual differences cognitive reflection decision making
OWNX--: we measured performance number participants cognitive reflection test citation number decision making tasks
OWNX--: we examined relation cognitive reflection performance tasks assess correspondence distinct coherence predicting ratings chess players
OWNX--: we found significant correlations between cognitive reflection all estimation measures correspondence tasks
OWNX--: our results suggest cognitive reflection thinking disposition includes more characteristics than originally proposed frederick citation
OWNX--: we proposed cognitive reflection related concept actively open minded thinking citation
MISC--: we concluded cognitive reflection thinking disposition interacts knowledge domain specific heuristics characteristics environment may play essential role adaptation decision maker different environments situations
MISC--: humans often violate tenets rationality ruled logic statistics expected utility theory other normative models rational decision making citation
MISC--: instead making decisions judgments based those models humans tend use heuristics sometimes lead them commit systematic errors biases citation
MISC--: nonetheless not all humans biased some them perform if they use normative models rationality citation
MISC--: numerous studies shown adherence normative principles cognitive abilities thinking dispositions positively related citation
OWNX--: this article aims investigate role thinking disposition cognitive reflection decision making
MISC--: frederick citation defined cognitive reflection ability disposition resist reporting response first comes mind pp number developed cognitive reflection test crt order measure this thinking disposition
MISC--: frederick also proposed more general conception cognitive reflection based dual system theories citation
MISC--: briefly dual system theories propose humans two cognitive systems system number s processes quick effortless intuitive heuristic system number s processes slow effortful reflective rule based
MISC--: based default interventionist conception system number citation frederick citation identified two characteristics system number related cognitive reflection its capacity monitor system number s outputs its capacity override system number s functioning
MISC--: research shown individual differences crt play role individual s decisions judgments tasks where their behavior could compared predictions normative models citation
MISC--: those studies found crt was positively related choices predicted expected utility theory citation risky choice tasks
MISC--: note however frederick citation also found domain gains high crt scorers chose more risky options than low crt scorers even when expected value risk option was lower than safe option
MISC--: intertemporal choice frederick citation showed crt was positively related choosing patient options i e high crt scorers had lower discount rates than low crt scorers oechssler et al citation found almost significant difference same direction
OWNX--: furthermore oechssler et al citation found high crt scorers were better than low crt scorers at avoiding logical fallacies also they were less overconfident
MISC--: this article concerned three topics related cognitive reflection number do individual differences cognitive reflection measured crt influence behavior correspondence decision making tasks those accuracy measured external criterion rather than internal consistency number does crt measure only ability disposition resist reporting response first comes mind
MISC--: does also measure broader disposition actively open minded thinking citation number does general knowledge account influence cognitive reflection decision making
MISC--: does cognitive reflection influence decision making independently general knowledge
MISC--: correspondence tasks those test correspondence participants estimations facts world citation
MISC--: example participant s estimations number inhabitants cities compared actual number inhabitants cities
MISC--: theoretical interest correspondence tasks good performance them typically explained participants use fast frugal heuristics citation not adherence normative principles
OWNX--: far we aware present study first one relating cognitive reflection measured crt correspondence decision making tasks
MISC--: previous research shown high crt scorers engage heuristic behavior tasks investigate participants judgments but not whether judgments match facts world citation
MISC--: cokely kelley citation found high performance crt was related more elaborative heuristic search
OWNX--: based results we predicted cognitive reflection performance would positively related correspondence tasks use heuristics helpful
MISC--: second topic we investigated was whether crt only measures disposition refrain reporting intuitive response suggested cokely kelley citation crt also measures reflectiveness thoroughness decision making citation
MISC--: if this case cognitive reflection measured crt would more general thinking disposition analogous baron s citation concept actively open minded thinking
MISC--: third topic was concerned alternative explanations role crt decision making tasks
MISC--: since crt positively correlates different types general knowledge e g numeracy citation academic achievement citation could argued relation between crt decision making explained individual differences general knowledge
OWNX--: we tested this using tasks did not require numeracy skills
