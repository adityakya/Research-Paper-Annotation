MISC--: recent research suggesting people who maximize less happy than those who satisfice received considerable fanfare
AIMX--: current study investigates whether this conclusion reflects construct itself rather how measured
MISC--: we developed alternative measure maximizing tendency theory based good psychometric properties predicts behavioral outcomes
CONT--: contrast existing maximization measure our new measure did not correlate life dissatisfaction nor most maladaptive personality decision making traits
MISC--: we conclude interpretation maximizers unhappy may due poor measurement construct
OWNX--: we present more reliable valid measure future researchers use
MISC--: term satisfice was coined herbert simon citation describe decision making strategy strives adequacy rather than optimality
MISC--: people generally satisfice according simon citation because they not wits maximize p number
MISC--: more recently tendency satisfice maximize been conceptualized individual difference trait citation
OWNX--: schwartz his colleagues developed maximization scale contains number self report items aimed at assessing general tendency seek optimality e g i treat relationships like clothing i expect try lot before i get perfect fit
MISC--: 
MISC--: low scores measure intended reflect general tendency satisfice
MISC--: findings based use this scale appeared top academic journals citation inferences drawn about maximizers been reported major media citation best selling book citation
MISC--: general maximizers characterized unhappy group people debilitated unrealistically high expectations face excess options
OWNX--: given strong inferences been drawn about mental well being maximizers versus satisficers based responses maximization scale especially important we confidence construct validity measure
MISC--: highhouse diab citation suggested maximization scale falls short commonly accepted psychometric standards
MISC--: purpose present research therefore was better understand nature construct measured maximization scale propose alternative measure maximization construct
