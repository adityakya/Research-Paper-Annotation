AIMX--: this paper uses proprietary data blackjack table las vegas analyze how expectation regret affects peoples decisions during gambles
OWNX--: even among group people who choose participate risk taking activity we find strong evidence economically significant omission bias number percent mistakes at table caused playing too conservatively resulting substantial monetary losses
MISC--: this behavior equally prevalent among large stakes gamblers does not change face more complicated strategic decisions
MISC--: much modern economics built premise people maximize their expected utility wealth when making decisions under uncertainty
MISC--: contrast psychologists argue people often act not so much maximize their expected utility but instead minimize their expected regret people make choices minimize their expected feeling remorse when action turns out badly compared other alternatives citation
MISC--: some decision environments this lead people suboptimally favor inaction over action inducing what known omission bias citation
MISC--: inaction plays salient role wide range decisions
MISC--: example people reticent vaccinate children potentially lethal vaccine even when this risk pales comparison incidence death caused primary disease citation
MISC--: staggering number us households fail rebalance their stock portfolios when optimal do so citation
MISC--: many us workers under participate their retirement plans despite presence employer matching programs citation
MISC--: shoppers often reluctant make purchases when discounts randomly offered market citation
OWNX--: calibrating impact expected regret omission bias challenging outside experimental setting because requires parameterizing complex set beliefs controlling risk aversion
AIMX--: this paper we study expected regret omission bias analyzing actual play at blackjack table las vegas
OWNX--: blackjack two important features make attractive this purpose
OWNX--: first setting aside issue card counting easy categorize optimal play every conceivable situation document departures optimal play unambiguous way
CONT--: this because there well publicized solution game known basic strategy been widely accessible card players since number s
MISC--: indeed many card playing guides offer steps learning basic strategy
MISC--: second more importantly blackjack players place bets game before they make strategic decisions
OWNX--: therefore all but few situations bet essentially sunk cost once play begins optimal strategy independent player s level risk aversion
OWNX--: this fact allows us identify role regret avoidance inaction independent risk aversion
MISC--: data consist over number number hands played over number number rounds actual play las vegas casino
OWNX--: data our study were obtained pilot study bally mp number card chip recognition system originally designed mindplay intelligent games
MISC--: mp number system optically based tracks all bets choices during play capturing data covert non intrusive way
OWNX--: this allows us record essential features game manner leaves natural play game unaltered
OWNX--: using this novel data source we find strong evidence omission bias present ex ante choices card players make
MISC--: when blackjack players make mistakes they four times more likely make error failing act than they make error taking unnecessary i e suboptimal action
MISC--: relevant null hypothesis zero omission bias would errors commission omission occurring proportion how often players were optimally required stand take card under basic strategy
OWNX--: even if we focus areas strategy space heavily favor action optimal strategy leading high number passive mistakes under null we reject null zero omission bias high degree confidence
MISC--: economic magnitude omission bias large
MISC--: aggregate players single hand deals who followed basic strategy won number number percent time very close theoretical win rate reported blackjack guides
CONT--: deviators won only number number percent time statistically significantly lower
MISC--: total about number number changed hands during pilot study
MISC--: players followed basic strategy won total over number number while they lost only about number number following basic strategy
MISC--: contrast only number number was won over number number lost hands deviated basic strategy
MISC--: passive mistakes lost over number every dollar won while aggressive mistakes lost only about number number every dollar won
MISC--: therefore passive mistakes not only more common they more costly
OWNX--: we consider alternative explanations other than omission bias choices we observe
OWNX--: first explanation card counters responsible deviations basic strategy
OWNX--: explore this possibility we systematically examine deviations basic strategy find no evidence deviations vary count manner prescribed card counting strategies
OWNX--: we should also note this probably unlikely explanation since win rates among basic strategy deviators so low economic losses so high
OWNX--: second limited cognitive ability driving our results
MISC--: indeed may some players find difficult remember optimal choice all situations
OWNX--: control this we account strategic difficulty certain situations e g playing hands soft versus hard totals
MISC--: idea here if cognitive limitations make omission bias more prevalent then should more pronounced among more difficult hands
OWNX--: we find though omission bias not more pronounced among hands higher order thinking required
MISC--: third possible explanation players derive utility continued play thus reluctant take additional card if doing so might exclude them participating rest round
OWNX--: test this possibility we account position player at table number players seated at table
OWNX--: at large tables we find no evidence passive mistakes cluster disproportionately more among those who high seat order at table
OWNX--: admittedly this does not completely rule out consideration staying live hand however staying live does represent another source expected regret
OWNX--: indeed if people were willing sacrifice expected winnings because they would feel remorse if they did not continue game when they busted this would further support our argument expected regret impacts strategic decisions
AIMX--: analysis this paper replicates extends work keren wagenaar citation who used game blackjack laboratory understanding player s attitudes about game
MISC--: they observed complete history play number subjects amsterdam casino conducted personal interviews many players learn their self perceptions how they make decisions
OWNX--: while they collected rich data set provided many insights our analysis distinct we focus omission bias alternative explanations this result
MISC--: casino indeed opportune place study other aspects human behavior decision making
MISC--: sundali croson citation studied hot hand bias gambler s fallacy analyzing videotapes individuals who play roulette casino reno nevada
MISC--: public entertainment also been convenient venue study though many instances difficult disentangle regret avoidance risk aversion cognitive limitations
MISC--: example tenorio cason citation derive subgame perfect nash equilibrium game segment television show price right document systematic deviations optimal strategy
OWNX--: deviations indeed consistent omission bias risk aversion cognitive limitations but determining one responsible observed behavior generally difficult
AIMX--: rest paper organized follows
OWNX--: section we review rules blackjack discuss basic strategy describe data were collected used analysis
OWNX--: section we explore main findings
