MISC--: recent years numerous studies comparing intuition deliberation been published
MISC--: however relatively little known about cognitive processes underlying two decision modes
OWNX--: two studies we analyzed effects decision mode instructions processes information search integration using eye tracking technology between participants study number within participants study number design
OWNX--: our findings indicate instruction deliberate does not necessarily lead qualitatively different information processing compared instruction decide intuitively
OWNX--: we found no difference mean fixation duration distribution short medium long fixations
OWNX--: short fixations particular prevailed under both decision mode instructions while long fixations indicating conscious calculation based information processing were rarely observed
MISC--: instruction induced deliberation led higher number fixations more complete information search more repeated information inspections
OWNX--: we interpret our findings support hypothesis intuitive deliberate decision modes share same basic processes supplemented additional operations deliberate decision mode
MISC--: according commonly held assumptions individuals sometimes make decisions deliberately sometimes rely their intuition gut feeling
MISC--: although distinction between two types information processing now widely accepted judgment decision making jdm research citation relatively little known about cognitive affective processes underlie them
MISC--: different models rely automatic processes might considered account intuition see glockner witteman press overview
MISC--: models range mainly cognitive evidence accumulation citation sampling citation network models citation more affect based approaches citation
MISC--: furthermore many theories concern interplay between intuitive deliberate processes
MISC--: long tradition dual process models postulates clear distinction between intuition deliberation
MISC--: kahneman frederick citation pointed out dual process models come many flavors but all distinguish cognitive operations quick associative others slow rule governed
MISC--: despite apparent consensus regarding basic properties intuition deliberation dual process framework been criticized being not sufficiently specified citation
MISC--: second crucial critique concerns fact evidence dual process theories predominantly based outcome measures while cognitive processes underlying intuition deliberation were mainly neglected citation
OWNX--: furthermore theorizing dual process theories inconsistent wealth models hard summarize according simple criteria
MISC--: one suggestion categorizing dual process models into three classes according interplay two decision modes was made evans citation
MISC--: first class so called pre emptive theories characterized initial selection between two rather distinct kinds processes
MISC--: instance mode selection models might subsumed under this class citation
MISC--: second class theories denoted parallel competitive postulates parallel activation both processing modes kind competition among them might result conflicting responses
MISC--: this assumption most strongly advocated sloman citation other authors hold this view well citation present consistent evidence citation
MISC--: third class theories so called default interventionist models citation state intuitive processes always activated first default mode deliberate processes may intervene upon intuitive processes
MISC--: evans citation instance assumes heuristic processes generate default responses analytic processes might intervene scrutinize potentially correct initial response
MISC--: similar vein network models argue automatic processes build basis every decision only supplemented deliberate processes if necessary citation
MISC--: number hammond hamm grassia pearson had already suggested intuition deliberation not completely distinct categories cognitive processes between people switch
MISC--: rather they seen poles cognitive continuum task factors influence how far one moves toward one other pole
OWNX--: present paper we used eye tracking technology analyze fine grained level how instruction decide intuitively deliberately affects information search integration
OWNX--: specifically we tested whether decision mode instructions induce qualitatively different information integration processes
OWNX--: we try relate this at first glance methodological question theoretical issue dual processing models namely whether reasonable assume intuition deliberation distinct whether both might rely similar basic processes just supplemented additional processing steps
OWNX--: we proceed follows first we discuss dual process theories special focus whether they postulate more distinct more integrated processes
OWNX--: second we describe probabilistic inference tasks discuss related cue weighting schemes
OWNX--: third we introduce core eye tracking measure single fixation duration used investigate qualitative differences information processing
OWNX--: fourth we derive hypotheses both distinct integrated processes perspective
