MISC--: gender difference risk preferences women being more averse risky choices robust experimental finding
MISC--: speculating sources this difference croson gneezy recently pointed tendency women experience emotions more strongly suggested feeling more strongly about negative outcomes would lead greater risk aversion
AIMX--: here we test this hypothesis international survey number respondents india number us where we ask questions about hypothetical lottery
OWNX--: both countries we find emotions about outcomes stronger among women this effect partially mediates gender difference willingness enter lottery
MISC--: why do women engage less risky behaviors than men
MISC--: prior work demonstrates females lower risk preferences less risky behavior robust across variety contexts citation
MISC--: particular relevance current work researchers documented substantial gender differences financial decisions involving risk citation
MISC--: women instance substantially less likely than men enter lotteries citation
MISC--: number meta theoretical perspectives structural role theories citation evolutionary approaches citation consistent observations
CONT--: however only recently researchers begun study underlying causal mechanisms gender differences
MISC--: there several possible explanations gender differences entering lotteries
MISC--: first males females whatever reason may assign different probabilities likelihood winning losing lotteries second men women may experience different positive negative reactions benefits costs entering lotteries
MISC--: recent review literature gender differences risk preferences croson gneezy citation pointed research tendency women experience stronger emotional reactions outcomes events than men
MISC--: authors hypothesized tendency women experience stronger emotional reactions outcomes may explain gender differences risk preferences
AIMX--: goal current study address this heretofore untested hypothesis using cross national sample
MISC--: elaborate tendency women experience stronger emotional reactions would explain gender differences risky financial decisions whether enter lottery if compared men women evaluated losing more strongly b strength negative evaluations losing predicted decisions about whether enter lotteries
OWNX--: thus we predict evaluations losing will mediate gender differences tendencies join lotteries
MISC--: but assuming moment females tend experience stronger emotional reactions all outcomes suggested croson gneezy they would also experience stronger positive reactions winning
OWNX--: wouldn t stronger positive reactions offset negative emotional reactions creating null effect gender lottery decisions
OWNX--: we argue typical setup lotteries assigns much higher probabilities losing than winning does not allow stronger positive reactions winning counterbalance stronger negative reactions losing
MISC--: other words because people know they most likely lose expected emotional reactions losing lotteries should much stronger predictor decisions enter them than expected emotional reactions winning lotteries
OWNX--: thus even if we do find stronger reactions winning losing among women we expect only reactions losing will influence decisions play
MISC--: results recent study harris et al citation consistent this hypothesis
MISC--: using sample undergraduate psychology students researchers measured gender differences stated likelihood engaging variety risky behaviors
MISC--: researchers found most domains females weighed negative outcomes more strongly than did males
OWNX--: further compared males females expected negative outcomes occur greater likelihood
MISC--: finally harris colleauges found evaluation negative outcomes well expected likelihood those outcomes partially mediated gender differences stated willingness engage risky behaviors
MISC--: but extent decision makers overestimate likelihood negatively valued events citation we cannot know certain whether gender differences reactions losing explain gender differences lottery decisions
OWNX--: thus one goal current reseaerch make probabilities winning losing known explicit measure gender differences evaluations winning losing under conditions
MISC--: explained below second goal study was offer cross cultural test prediction
OWNX--: study outlined section follow tests hypotheses using amazon s mechanical turk
MISC--: users tend disproportionately u s india
BASE--: thus our dataset allows us test robustness our hypotheses using men women two different continents
MISC--: prior work citation addressing cross cultural differences risk taking found americans tend less risk seeing than chinese
MISC--: hsee weber use cushion hypothesis explain cross national differences arguing times financial need decision makers collectivist cultures rely network ties help
MISC--: this cushion safety net thus allows more risky behavior
OWNX--: thus we might expect observe more risk taking among indians than americans
CONT--: most importantly however we should expect predicted gender differences occur above beyond any cross cultural differences
