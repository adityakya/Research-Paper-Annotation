MISC--: several decision making models predict should possible affect real binary choices manipulating relative amount visual attention decision makers pay two alternatives
OWNX--: we present results three behavioral experiments testing this prediction
MISC--: visual attention controlled manipulating amount time subjects fixate two items
MISC--: manipulation differential impact appetitive aversive items
MISC--: appetitive items number number percent more likely chosen long fixation condition
MISC--: contrast aversive items number percent less likely chosen long fixation condition
MISC--: effect present primary goods foods higher order durable goods posters
OWNX--: many behavioral scientists believe individuals make choices first assigning values objects then selecting option highest value perhaps some noise
OWNX--: this raises several questions how values guide decisions henceforth called decision values computed
OWNX--: how values compared
MISC--: what properties those processes
MISC--: questions receiving increasing amounts attention psychology behavioral neuroscience neuroeconomics
MISC--: particular several models how decision values computed compared been proposed citation
MISC--: models based simple idea
MISC--: decision value forecast made prior consumption actual value will derived consuming item
MISC--: models assume decision values computed making repeated noisy estimates consumption value then integrated over time
MISC--: interestingly some models received considerable empirical support both human behavioral monkey electrophysiology experiments
MISC--: models make some striking predictions important behavioral economic implications
MISC--: example they predict decision value assigned item thus willingness pay depend amount time spent computing citation
MISC--: series experiments testing this prediction armel rangel citation showed willingness pay appetitive items increases significantly computation time opposite true aversive items
MISC--: krajbich armel rangel citation extended this class models investigate role visual attention binary choice
OWNX--: their model described next section makes two stark predictions about impact choice exogenous changes visual attention
MISC--: firt predicts should possible increase probability item chosen changing relative amount time subjects fixate item during decision making process
MISC--: second predicts effect should positive appetitive items negative aversive items
OWNX--: this paper describes results three behavioral experiments testing predictions
MISC--: large extent results consistent predictions
MISC--: properties value computation comparison processes should interest behavioral scientists since they determine extent individuals able make quality choices circumstances they able do so
OWNX--: example results this paper suggest incidental variables affect visual attention displays lighting conditions migh affect choices made
MISC--: addition properties processes could important implications behavioral welfare effects practices store marketing
MISC--: our work related literature construction preference behavioral economics marketing studied impact several incidental variables computation decision values citation
OWNX--: example weber kirsner citation asked subjects make choices between pairs lotteries graphical display compared two conditions one larger payoffs were depicted larger fonts one smaller payoffs were depicted larger fonts
MISC--: they found subjects were more willing choose riskier gamble potentially larger payoffs first condition
MISC--: common interpretation results outcomes larger font size received more attention this lead relative overweithting those outcomes
MISC--: related this tversky kahneman citation argued s shaped probability weighting function prospect theory driven perceptual biases place excessive relative attention very low very high probability events result overweighted relative mid range probabilities
OWNX--: all results what manipulated relative attention received different dimensions choice problem e g probabilities gains
AIMX--: contrast this paper we show changes relative amount visual attention received entire items also affect likelihood they chosen
OWNX--: thus our results do not depend one dimension choice being overweighted at expense another but highlighted model described next section process relative value comparison favoring one option at expense other
MISC--: our work also related literature mere exposure effect citation
MISC--: typical experiment shows subjects reports about how much they like seeing stimulus e g chinese ideogram foreign language word increased through repeated brief previous exposures items citation
AIMX--: there two important differences between mee processes studied this paper
AIMX--: first mee about how previous exposures affect actual consumption experience seeing item whereas we study how visual attention during process decision making affects choices made
AIMX--: thus whereas mee about impact repeated exposures learning across trials effect we investigate about impact exposure time within single decision trial
MISC--: second whereas mee defined ramping up positive liking ratings result consuming items even if they aversive our effect looks more like amplification effect positive appetitive items but negative aversive ones
OWNX--: far we know this first experimental study impact decisions exogenously explicitly manipulated fixation durations during process choice
MISC--: closest experiment work shimojo et al citation who study role visual attention judgments about facial attractiveness
