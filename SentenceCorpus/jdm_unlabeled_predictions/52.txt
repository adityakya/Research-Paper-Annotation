MISC--: been proposed recognition form basis simple but ecologically rational decision strategies citation
MISC--: borges goldstein ortmann gigerenzer citation found constructing share portfolios based simple name recognition alone often yielded better returns than market index
OWNX--: we describe four studies seven samples participants three countries total n number returns recognized unrecognized shares several stock markets were tracked over various periods time
OWNX--: we find no support claim simple strategy name recognition used general strategy select stocks yield better than average returns
MISC--: however there was some suggestion data recognition performs better when market falling worse when rising
OWNX--: follow up study indicated absence overall recognition effect could not easily attributed our reliance student participants smaller samples than borges et al citation had used
OWNX--: we conclude respect changes value selecting stocks basis name recognition near random method portfolio construction offers little if any benefit personal investor
MISC--: quick dirty decisions reasonably expected result satisfactory outcomes do complex problems demand complex strategies
MISC--: extent array difficult choices we face adequately tackled simple strategies been recurring theme five decades decision research citation
MISC--: one simplest choice inference strategies imaginable recognition heuristic
MISC--: quite simply if one two objects recognized other not then infer recognized object higher value citation
OWNX--: thus when asked pick movie yielded greater gross takings sin city steget efter person who recognizes only one titles use recognition heuristic though person who recognises neither both movies must make their choice some other way
MISC--: when rate frequency exposure correlates positively value heuristic will lead choice inference accuracy above chance levels citation
MISC--: thus our example positive association between media coverage advertising movie attendances means recognition heuristic should some ecological validity choice question
BASE--: recent analysis schooler hertwig citation shows effectiveness recognition may even enhanced forgettingeven though this leads failure recognize some previously seen objects
MISC--: if remembered objects more likely associated relevant characteristics environment than forgotten ones this will enhance predictive inferential power recognition
AIMX--: this paper we examine application recognition heuristic investment decisions where one many possible investments made
MISC--: here recognition heuristic demands when choosing set objects larger set choose subset recognized objects citation
MISC--: why might people use heuristic
MISC--: first some situations they may consciously accept logic expressed previous paragraph
MISC--: probably makes sense many people consumer products movies sports teams sports personalities they heard more successful than those they notand they will happy make inferences accordingly
MISC--: there occasions when failure generates notoriety ford s edsell car movie flop waterworld number jamaican bobsleigh team eddie eagle whose olympic ski jumping preparation lacked only ski jump
MISC--: nonetheless generally speaking people know success breeds personal exposure column inches will encourage recognition
MISC--: alternatively there may other occasions when absence deliberative reasoning about recognition more intuitive processes may drive recognition based choices
MISC--: people reliably prefer familiar stimuli citation more so when they fail recognise previously presented stimuli at better than chance levels presumably not conscious prior exposure citation
MISC--: bornstein citation suggests preference familiar may adaptive unfamiliar stimuli situations greater potential risk than familiar ones do
MISC--: people also judge more fluent i e more easily processed stimuli positively citation often base their judgements how easily objects events recalled citation
CONT--: although not necessarily easy distinguish empirically accounts conceptually distinct recognition heuristicstimuli may more less familiar fluent available but simply recognised not recognised
MISC--: nonetheless recognised stimuli inevitably more familiar more available than unrecognised ones possibly average more fluent too citation
MISC--: features could explain why recognition based choice may occur even when conditions make effective strategy certain circumstances unknown absent
CONT--: use recognition heuristic been subject several empirical investigations
MISC--: gigerenzer goldstein citation reported this heuristic helped people make correct inferences when faced task assessing two foreign cities had greater population
MISC--: some modified experimental designs this observation also been replicated additional samples cities citation rivers mountains citation
MISC--: assessing geographical objects associated stable characteristics true answer rarely changed living memory will usually not change many years come citation
MISC--: example correct answer question city larger colchester stockholm
MISC--: been same centuries unlikely different foreseeable future
MISC--: this contrasts dynamic domains sports events where accuracy inferences varies over time
MISC--: instance tennis ace roger federer likely though not certain beat lowly ranked ezequiel krivulin
MISC--: furthermore there may eventually come time when this highly recognized superstar will begin lose regular basis younger unknown players
MISC--: nonetheless been shown recognition some extent predict outcome sports events citation
AIMX--: this paper we re examine effectiveness recognition heuristic using important but notoriously difficult taskstock picking
MISC--: this task also associated variable characteristics so provides tough test recognition heuristic
MISC--: borges et al citation found name recognition surprisingly successful basis stock investment
MISC--: lay people business graduates usa germany indicated company names they recognized among largest companies listed new york frankfurt stock exchanges
MISC--: portfolios shares consisting most frequently recognized shares outperformed portfolios consisting shares recognized fewer than number percent participants over six month period beginning december number
OWNX--: portfolios frequently recognised shares outperformed market index six eight possible comparisons treating recognition data four pools participants across each two stock markets distinct comparisons
OWNX--: only americans recognition u s stocks did recognition based investment under perform market index
MISC--: this was symptomatic general trend advantage highly recognised stocks was greatest when people were apparently most ignoranti e using recognition data foreign stock markets where recognition rates were unsurprisingly lower than domestic stocks
MISC--: simple strategy should prove effective was surprisingand therefore grabbed attention among financial press runs counter efficient market hypothesis anticipates index cannot consistently beaten simple investment strategies
MISC--: borges et al citation provide some speculation reasons their results instance possibility features market share company size prestige may all associated both recognition profitability limited recognition best exploits ability recognition heuristic discriminate profitable unprofitable shares
MISC--: put simply suggestion company success other features foster recognition also tend drive up share value
MISC--: hence recognized shares will yield higher average returns than unrecognized ones
MISC--: if individual recognizes few shares they probably only recognize elite companies whose size success made them household names good prospects share return
MISC--: however important question whether mechanism could sustainable market
MISC--: boyd failed replicate borges et al s citation results falling bear market sample american students providing recognition data us stocks
MISC--: both boyd citation borges et al citation discuss possibility recognition may not good strategy markets when big firms often observed perform poorly
MISC--: merton s citation model capital market equilibrium predicts attempts replicate borges et al s citation finding more likely fail than succeed
MISC--: merton citation points out investors acquire only those shares they recognize
MISC--: consequently demand value will tend higher company shares widely recognized
MISC--: however merton s theory predicts investment returns will correlate negatively recognitionmore highly recognized firms will yield lower returns implying recognition heuristic should under perform market index
MISC--: this consistent neglected firms effect whereby shares firms narrow investor bases outperform more widely held shares citation
MISC--: effect persists even when company size controlled may interpreted informational effect
OWNX--: obvious reasons investors need information order predict future profits dividends stock returns
MISC--: less information investors greater chance important information predicts extreme changes value missing
OWNX--: however investment relevant information e g earnings releases will less abundant therefore more expensive obscure firms than high profile corporations enjoy high levels recognition release detailed reports regular basis
MISC--: therefore order invest unfamiliar companies investors require risk premium their investment roughly corresponds their increased effort searching information about those companies
MISC--: risk aversion would make investing potentially risky shares relatively unknown firms comparatively unappealing unless better than average returns expected shares
MISC--: contrast market will sustain share returns well known companies more modest investors feel they obtain sufficient information shares able guard against risk severe losses
MISC--: several studies examined factors ought affect recognition citation analyst coverage advertising expenditure exchange listing
MISC--: many found effect upon security value consistent merton citation
OWNX--: instance barber odean citation showed private investors tended purchase high profile stocks had previously experienced high volumes returns had been recent news reports
OWNX--: this strategy was shown under perform market index
MISC--: weber siebenmorgen weber citation provide some insight into why investors might follow unprofitable investment strategy driven attention grabbing features shares
MISC--: they found people tend perceive shares they recognize less risky than those they fail recognize
MISC--: more direct tests merton s theory tended focus breadth ownership among institutions holdings excess number million proxy recognition
MISC--: contrary predictions merton citation chen et al citation found low levels recognition predicted low returns
MISC--: however lehavy sloan citation showed changes breadth ownership do indeed positively predict current share value negatively predict future returns when autocorrelations value return over time controlled
MISC--: lehavy sloan citation others who examined breadth ownership recognize its limitations proxy recognition
MISC--: whilst plausible increases recognition will often result increases breadth ownership illogical decreases breadth ownership might imply some investors no longer recognize particular company they previously knew
AIMX--: studies reported here employ direct measure recognition we simply ask sample people whether they recognize name companies listed stock exchange
OWNX--: thus share recognition considered at level individual potential investor rather than at level large corporate investor
OWNX--: we use data re examine whether simple recognition alone form basis viable investment strategy
MISC--: particular two questions relate how well borges et al s citation findings generalize considered
OWNX--: firstly were their results simply function random variation prices applicable only particular period time
BASE--: this end our studies commence at different time points we track share value over differing periods time
MISC--: readers will see despite being at mercy markets this allowed us test effectiveness recognition heuristic markets fell rose differing degreespermitting detailed re evaluation borges et al s citation boyd s citation findings under variety conditions
MISC--: secondly borges et al s findings restricted only particular combinations populations participants stock markets
MISC--: thus one say recognition ecologically valid strategy stock selection simply recognition data germans americans selects better than average german stocks
OWNX--: considering this issue we examine recognition data stocks five countries participants three countries
OWNX--: all number number possible combinations this could yield availableand some combinations examined more than one study recognition data different samples participants collected at different points time
OWNX--: this permits us test recognition heuristic over range recognition rates typically high domestic home shares low overseas away shares
MISC--: examination many participant market combinations important order determine whether there might any general effect favours penalizes recognized over unrecognized shares
MISC--: although borges et al citation report eight comparisons between portfolios recognized unrecognized shares not independent comparisons
MISC--: instance there was some overlap shares always recognized laypeople business graduates given country citation
OWNX--: summary we re examine two key findings borges et al citation data number overall validity recognition method stock selection number increased effectiveness recognition more ignorant participants lower levels recognition
OWNX--: note we not interested whether personal professional investors actually use recognition heuristicsimply whether if they did would effective
