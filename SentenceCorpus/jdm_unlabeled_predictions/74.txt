OWNX--: we present concordant ranks cr strategy decision makers use quickly find alternative proximate ideal alternative multi attribute decision space
OWNX--: cr implies decision makers prefer alternatives exhibit concordant ranks between attribute values attribute weights
OWNX--: we show situations where alternatives equal multi attribute utility mau minimization weighted euclidean distance wed ideal alternative implies choice cr alternative
OWNX--: two experiments participants chose among well evaluated alternatives were constructed equal mau
OWNX--: experiment number four alternatives were designed way choice each alternative would consistent one particular choice strategy one was cr strategy
MISC--: experiment number participants were presented cr alternative number arbitrary alternatives
MISC--: both experiments participants tended choose cr alternative
MISC--: cr alternative was average evaluated more attractive than other alternatives
MISC--: addition measures wed between given alternatives ideal alternative large agreed preference order choices attractiveness evaluations different types alternatives
MISC--: findings indicate both choices attractiveness evaluations guided proximity alternatives ideal alternative
MISC--: modern consumer society involves many decision situations one alternative needs chosen set several fairly attractive alternatives
OWNX--: this true large investments purchase car home but also everyday consumer choices deciding what eat
MISC--: all choice situations there might several alternatives cannot easily discarded
MISC--: indeed fundamental feature market economies offer several alternatives attractive at least some people some times depending their different tastes monetary constraints
MISC--: thus there markets attractive luxury cars attractive budget cars so
MISC--: usually decision makers find promising alternative serves candidate final choice may checked more less thoroughly differentiated other alternatives before making final choice citation
MISC--: they look through car ads browse website homes sale may quickly find promising alternative
MISC--: this ability make quick choices helps consumer solve life puzzles because lack time fundamental feature modern consumer society citation
AIMX--: present paper concerned strategies people use situations
MISC--: how do people quickly find most promising alternative out several fairly attractive alternatives difficult differentiate each other respect their overall attractiveness
OWNX--: we suggest situations individuals will choose alternative close their ideal alternative
OWNX--: this manifests itself using strategy we call concordant ranks strategy cr
MISC--: according this strategy decision makers choose alternative there concordance between rank order attribute values importance weights attributes provided overall attractiveness alternatives approximately equal
OWNX--: study choices test validity cr strategy we presented participants individually tailored alternatives choose each constructed approximately equal attractiveness
MISC--: assuming multi attribute utility mau citation could used approximate indicator alternative attractiveness alternatives were constructed they were equal mau based attributes attribute weights participants generated themselves
MISC--: study focused how participants quickly find promising alternative i e tentative preliminary choice rather than how they build up complex argumentation structure justify final choice citation
