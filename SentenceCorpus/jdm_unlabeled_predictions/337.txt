MISC--: recognition heuristic models adaptive use dominant role recognition knowledge judgment under uncertainty
OWNX--: several predictions heuristic makes empirical tests predominantly focused proposed noncompensatory processing recognition
MISC--: some authors emphasized heuristic needs scrutinized based precise tests exclusive use recognition
MISC--: although precise tests clear merits i critically evaluate value tests they currently employed
MISC--: first i argue using precise measures exclusive use recognition go beyond showing recognition heuristic like every model cannot capture reality completely
MISC--: second i illustrate how precise tests based response times lead unsubstantiated conclusions if fact recognition heuristic does not model recognition judgment itself ignored
CONT--: finally i highlight two key but so far neglected aspects recognition heuristic connection between recognition memory recognition heuristic b mechanisms underlying adaptive use recognition
MISC--: his essays french philosopher michel de montaigne suggested good memory not necessarily coupled good decision making
MISC--: fact he seems imply decisions sometimes even benefit deficits memory
MISC--: how could this possible
MISC--: one answer because structures mind often reflect meaningful regularities world citation blanks memory exploited making inferences about world
MISC--: notion judgments feed dynamics memory been taken up several models decision making
MISC--: instance tversky kahneman citation proposed ease instances occurrences brought mind ecologically valid clue p number about world availability heuristic based this ease might operate when people judge probability frequency
MISC--: more recently goldstein gigerenzer citation described recognition heuristic model how people recruit recognition memory when making inferences more generally
MISC--: contrast availability heuristic recognition heuristic clearly specified computational model precise search stopping decision rules
MISC--: moreover recognition heuristic was proposed adaptive mental tool specific boundary conditions citation
MISC--: recognition heuristic makes several testable predictions about recognition its use decision making
MISC--: first recognition heuristic assumed ecologically rational i e exploiting regularity environment recognition should frequently correlated quantities world
MISC--: second people s use recognition heuristic should sensitive structure environment
MISC--: third recognition heuristic predicts recognition processed noncompensatory fashion recognition should supersede further cue knowledge
MISC--: finally heuristic predicts under certain conditions counterintuitive less more effect where recognizing fewer objects lead more accurate inferences than recognizing more objects
MISC--: citation precise definition recognition heuristic its assumed role adaptive mental tool made attractive study object
CONT--: maybe not surprisingly not all empirical investigations found evidence supporting heuristic
MISC--: several predictions heuristic makes seems fair say assumed noncompensatory processing recognition received greatest attention so far generated strongest objection citation
MISC--: some authors emphasized need precise tests recognition heuristic developed precise measures exclusive use recognition arguing precise models deserve precise measures b conducted precise tests information processing recognition based inference based response times citation
OWNX--: following i discuss value precise tests they currently used argue they done little advance our understanding recognition based inference
CONT--: addition i highlight two key issues underlying use recognition decision making seem been neglected result strong focus testing noncompensatory processing recognition
OWNX--: first we need better understand relationship between recognition studied memory literature recognition memory tapped recognition heuristic
MISC--: second i summarize proposals how people might adaptively adjust their reliance recognition across different situations
MISC--: importantly i do not argue developments precise measures demonstrations recognition heuristic s failure predict data should ignored
MISC--: rather i call more constructive way use findings refining models memory based decision making
