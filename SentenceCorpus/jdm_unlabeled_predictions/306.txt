MISC--: previous research demonstrates overestimation rare events judgment tasks underweighting rare events decisions experience
AIMX--: current paper presents three laboratory experiments field study explore this pattern
OWNX--: results suggest overestimation underweighting pattern emerge parallel
MISC--: part difference between two tendencies explained product contingent recency effect although estimations reflect negative recency choice behavior reflects positive recency
OWNX--: similar pattern observed field study immediately following aversive rare event i e suicide bombing people believe risk decreases negative recency but at same time exhibit more cautious behavior positive recency
OWNX--: rest difference consistent two well established mechanisms judgment error use small samples choice
MISC--: implications two stage choice model discussed
MISC--: studies human reaction low probability rare events reveal interesting difference between judgment decision making repeated settings
MISC--: judgments probability estimations appear reflect over sensitivity rare events
MISC--: estimated probability events occur probability below number number tends higher than objective probability citation
MISC--: other hand decision making experience tends reflect underweighting insensitivity rare events citation
MISC--: decision makers behave if events occur probability below number number occur smaller probability than their objective probability
MISC--: apparent discrepancy important light two stage choice model citation assumes choice predicted estimated probabilities
