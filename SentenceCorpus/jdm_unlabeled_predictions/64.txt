OWNX--: study moral judgments grows becomes imperative compare results across studies order create unified theories within field
MISC--: efforts potentially undermined however variations wording used different researchers
MISC--: current study sought determine whether when how variations wording influence moral judgments
MISC--: online participants responded number different moral vignettes e g trolley problem using number number adjectives wrong inappropriate forbidden blameworthy
OWNX--: half sample adjectives were preceded adverb morally
MISC--: results indicated people were more apt judge act wrong inappropriate than forbidden blameworthy disgusting acts were rated more acceptable when morally was included
OWNX--: although some wording differences emerged effects sizes were small suggest studies moral judgment different wordings legitimately compared
MISC--: more more psychological neuroscientific research moral judgments appears each year
MISC--: fascinating results accumulate question arises whether how individual studies fit together form larger picture
MISC--: order connect various studies guide future work this field researchers need determine studies conflict support each other simply talking past each other
MISC--: unfortunately precise comparisons hampered use different moral terms across studies
MISC--: different researchers ask whether acts wrong citation forbidden versus permitted citation inappropriate citation deserve blame citation
MISC--: some researchers include adverb morally before terms citation whereas others do not citation
CONT--: unclear whether judgments what morally wrong vary response same factors do judgments what forbidden inappropriate blameworthy
MISC--: some evidence comes meta analysis asymmetry between forbid versus allow attitudes research
MISC--: this study demonstrated people reluctant forbid but will readily not allow even though judgments conceptually equivalent citation
OWNX--: this asymmetry suggests moral judgments well may influenced subtle variations wording
MISC--: further evidence cushman citation showed harmless acts were judged more wrong than blameworthy only when act was intended believed cause harm
MISC--: this finding also suggests people some circumstances will draw fine distinctions between moral terms
MISC--: until effects wording variations understood we cannot tell whether studies similar moral issues couched different terms really agree disagree
MISC--: addition some wording effects moral judgments would undermine search moral faculty
MISC--: some researchers suggest moral judgments result innate psychological mechanisms even moral module conforms universal moral grammar citation
MISC--: others propose dual process models build emotions beliefs desires consequences into processes form moral judgments citation
MISC--: theories many more would challenged if people judge acts very different ways based moral terms used because psychologically real mechanisms would unlikely vary markedly fine differences wording within particular natural language
MISC--: conversely if certain patterns moral judgments robust enough persist through non substantial variations wording would help defend assumption studies investigating distinctive psychological mechanisms
MISC--: order bring this research together into coherent field determine whether there distinctive psychological mechanisms studied moral psychology we need know whether when how much phrasing questions different terms may lead different moral judgments
