OWNX--: series three experiments participants made inferences about one pair two objects scored higher criterion
OWNX--: first experiment was designed contrast prediction probabilistic mental model theory citation concerning sampling procedure hard easy effect
MISC--: experiment failed support theory s prediction particular pair randomly sampled item sets would differ percentage correct but observation german participants performed practically well comparisons between u s cities many they did not even recognize than comparisons between german cities about they knew much more ultimately led formulation recognition heuristic
MISC--: experiment number was second this time successful attempt unconfound item difficulty sampling procedure
OWNX--: experiment number participants knowledge recognition each city was elicited how often this could used make inference was manipulated
MISC--: choices were consistent recognition heuristic about number percent cases when discriminated people had no additional knowledge about recognized city about number percent when they had knowledge
OWNX--: frequency heuristic could used affected percentage correct mean confidence overconfidence predicted
MISC--: size reference class was also manipulated modified effects meaningful theoretically important ways
MISC--: history science technology repeatedly demonstrates many laws discovered many inventions made serendipitously product when researchers striving something else
MISC--: recognition heuristic just one example this was formulated post hoc explanation puzzling finding was observed while attempting test specific prediction theory probabilistic mental models citation
CONT--: while other papers contained this series special issues many references given therein illustrate how stimulating formulation recognition heuristic was how much research spurred present paper turns back clock reports three studies were conducted late number s early number s citation
AIMX--: this paper organized follows first part provides historical context led formulation recognition heuristic
MISC--: at outset this part brief summary pmm theory given
MISC--: experiment number then reported was conducted address one criticisms theory namely confounding sampling procedure item difficulty
OWNX--: specifically we compared over underconfidence two item sets were generated same sampling procedure but were nevertheless supposed differ respect percentage correct
MISC--: this attempt failed yielding counter intuitive finding german participants performed about same when making comparisons between german cities when making comparisons between u s cities
CONT--: experiment number reports second this time successful attempt unconfound item difficulty sampling procedure order answer question motivated experiment number
MISC--: second part also historical reports experiment number provides best my knowledge first empirical test recognition heuristic
OWNX--: was designed find out whether results obtained experiment number could explained participants having used recognition heuristic
OWNX--: this experiment participants knowledge recognition each city was elicited how often this could used make inference was manipulated
OWNX--: we also manipulated inclusion criterion turn size reference class cities were drawn when constructing paired comparisons
