MISC--: theory planned behaviour citation based utility framework risk feelings hypothesis citation feelings based behavioural model
OWNX--: tpb raf first compared contrasted
MISC--: two empirical studies investigated predictive power consequence based vs affect based evaluative judgements behavioural intentions study number n number applied regression model examine predictive value subset shared variables unique tpb variables unique raf variables intentions unsafe sex
OWNX--: study number n number experimentally examined whether intentions driven consequences feelings two decision vignettes opposite qualities positive hedonic experience potential negative consequences unsafe sex vs negative hedonic experience potential positive consequences back surgery
OWNX--: results supported tpb emphasising role outcome expectations construction intentions raf showing importance affective subcomponents attitudes
MISC--: humans sometimes act order reach outcome other times out enjoyment activity itself
MISC--: this difference been referred extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation citation incentives vs motivation citation utilitarian vs hedonically driven behaviour citation represents general dichotomy between action goal action mean towards goal
MISC--: there often conflict between hedonic quality behaviour its consequences
MISC--: although hedonic qualities could seen particular kind behavioural consequence experiential part displeasure definition present whereas other behavioural outputs lie future
OWNX--: thus one suggested underlying mechanism tension between behaviour consequences fundamental difference time perspective associated ongoing activities their consequences
MISC--: been suggested need self regulation exists most individuals due inconsistency between short long term consequences option citation
MISC--: intertemporal discounting exemplifies one failure balance subjective value immediate more distant goals systematic devaluation future opposed immediate outcomes citation
AIMX--: present paper focuses dilemmas where values associated performance behaviour values consequences conflict even when holding time perspective constant
MISC--: several theoretical accounts may shed light difference between actions goals means
MISC--: meta theories human motivation self determination theory citation centre motivational mechanisms claiming set basic motivational needs drive behaviour
CONT--: need competence autonomy belongingness proposed general behavioural driving forces fairly independently time perspectives
OWNX--: thus addition motivation towards mastery independence social norms direct our behaviour
MISC--: most socially accepted action default option complying may not experienced decision making
MISC--: other theories focus preventing factors cognitive limitations
MISC--: this end several dual process theories citation demonstrate our ability unique human predisposition pay attention potentially contradictory sources information e g affective experiential vs reason based consequential
MISC--: authors citation circumvent issue time perspective indirectly showing how intuitive basic effortless experiential heuristic system processing faster than intentional reason based effortful rational analytical system
MISC--: rapid processing affective immediate information may result behaviour more inclined follow affective rather than analytical system
CONT--: there ample evidence intentions may directed at activities just pleasure little consideration potential consequences e g smoking heavy drinking unsafe sex hazardous driving unhealthy eating
AIMX--: basis this tension between consequences feelings present study set out compare contrast two theoretical psychological frameworks identify key structures processes planned feelings based behaviour theory planned behaviour citation risk feelings hypothesis citation
OWNX--: furthermore we aimed at empirical investigation core predictors behavioural intentions decision making under ambivalence
MISC--: decision ambivalence here defined perceived tension between hedonic quality behaviour its potential consequences behavioural choices
AIMX--: present paper organized following two theoretical frameworks presented first followed theoretical analysis separates their basic components into shared unique variables
OWNX--: then we present outline results two empirical studies investigating predictive power models
OWNX--: next we discuss findings light theoretical frameworks reviewed literature
