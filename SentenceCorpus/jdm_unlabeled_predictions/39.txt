MISC--: people willing gamble more themselves than what they deem reasonable others
OWNX--: we addressed this question simplified computer gambling task subjects chose set number cards
OWNX--: subjects selected one card at time after being instructed number cards were good win dollar per card one was really bad lose all money end game
MISC--: subjects could stop playing at any time collect their winnings
OWNX--: some subjects played game others observed confederate
OWNX--: both groups took risks beyond what was rational i e number cards but textit actors were riskier than textit observers
MISC--: actor observer asymmetry occurred even after controlling monetary outcome i e having observers win prizes after controlling how question was framed i e asking observers what they themselves textit would do opposed what confederate textit should do
OWNX--: we discuss results relation theories decision making emphasize separate contributions rational experiential systems
MISC--: you at casino watching game black jack when player who hand sixteen asks another card
OWNX--: you quip yourself what idiot
MISC--: he should held at number
MISC--: but who s say you wouldn t done same
MISC--: after all decision making self likely depend cues processes not available when judging choices others
MISC--: reward having drawn good card prospect winning potential regret overreaching all blunted detached observer
MISC--: then again you may reach same decision whether you actor observer much information needed including success probability prize size potential loss all available rational choice
MISC--: this example illustrates decision making influenced both rational experiential factors citation
MISC--: rational processes effortful logical using cost benefit analysis determine best choice citation
MISC--: contrast experiential processes intuitive emotionally based using heuristics history reward punishment determine next behavior citation
MISC--: presumably experiential processes weigh more heavily actors decisions than observers judgments citation
MISC--: one reason this actors may privileged access their own affective reactions citation
MISC--: furthermore actors affective system tapped rewards punishments citation
MISC--: contrast observers usually not affected when they influence rewards punishments diminished their being decoupled action
MISC--: simple terms argued rewarded actions will show tendency repeated
MISC--: thus occurrence reward should motivate actors repeat rewarded action disregard potential costs beyond what observers would deem reasonable
AIMX--: current study we explored this specific instance actor observer asymmetry its relation rational experiential dichotomy
OWNX--: this we used modified version task first developed studying risk taking children citation
OWNX--: this paradigm ten cards were displayed computer screen subjects were told nine cards were good would pay dollar each while one card was disastrous would make them lose all money they had collected thus ending game
MISC--: subjects turned one card at time decided when stop collect their prize
MISC--: task could solved deciding advance how many cards turn sequentially deciding whether turn next card
MISC--: either way expected value this task highest turning five cards citation
MISC--: thus rational decision maker should stop after turning number cards
OWNX--: two experiments we explored possible departures rational decision making whether departures were moderated active task participation
