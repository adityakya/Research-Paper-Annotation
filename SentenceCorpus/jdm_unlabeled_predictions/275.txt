AIMX--: using stochastic dominance approach international dataset about number number catholic subjects we show incentives based absolute belief play crucial role religious practice church attendance prayer
OWNX--: furthermore we find when both positive heaven negative hell incentives available former much stronger effect than latter
MISC--: results confirmed using kolmogorov smirnov tests
MISC--: many studies examined role incentives their effect behavior individuals citation
MISC--: this study interest falls effect incentives religious behavior sense they increase decrease individual religious performance
MISC--: religious practice encouraged two types incentives earthly ones afterlife ones
AIMX--: this paper addresses second group
MISC--: previous studies analyzed effects afterlife incentives religious behavior
OWNX--: azzi ehrenberg citation were first propose test theoretical model afterlife religious capital
MISC--: they analyzed determinants participation religious activities using utility maximizing model
MISC--: among other results they found afterlife beliefs major determinant church attendance
MISC--: using several surveys carried out united states they provided empirical support their theory
MISC--: blomberg et al citation developed model where financial religious contributions motivated both current consumption afterlife considerations
MISC--: they show afterlife considerations play important role explaining financial religious contributions
MISC--: pyne citation studied relationship between religiosity fear death
MISC--: he found individuals who place higher probability existence afterlife invest more religious capital
MISC--: recently bra xf number garza et al citation estimated role afterlife beliefs production religious commodities concretely church attendance prayer
MISC--: using ordered logit regressions they found afterlife beliefs crucial determinants but more importantly beliefs heaven much more relevant than beliefs hell positive incentives stronger than negative ones
OWNX--: however this regression approach does not allow us study joint effect positive negative incentives
MISC--: when logit model contains interactions among variables two problems appear i computation partial effects becomes problematic ii interpretation estimate effects not straightforward
MISC--: showed norton et al citation estimated coefficients interaction terms do not reflect interaction effect moreover their statistical significance cannot tested through simple t test
MISC--: even more problematic interpretation given estimated interaction effect also conditional current value other independent variables
AIMX--: hence we cannot properly study meaning different interactions logit regression model
AIMX--: this paper presents different statistical tool stochastic dominance approach citation allows use straightforward interpretation joint effect positive negative incentives
OWNX--: our analyses confirm main results showed bra xf number garza et al citation revises interactive effects among positive negative incentives
OWNX--: easy graphical way we show afterlife incentives play crucial role religious performance comparing not only positive negative incentives but combination both compared
MISC--: study was carried out catholic people
MISC--: catholic religion church attendance prayer strategies lead heaven prevent hell
MISC--: church attendance prayer two dimensions religiosity reflect public religious activities versus private intimate prayer activities
MISC--: while church attendance also non religious motives networking building social ties private prayer activity more pure religious motives
AIMX--: using stochastic dominance approach we ask whether absolute beliefs eternal bliss heaven eternal damnation hell increase individual s religious investment reflected church attendance prayer whether absolute belief eternal damnation hell more less powerful incentive than eternal bliss heaven intensified religious effort
