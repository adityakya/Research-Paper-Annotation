MISC--: we examine two departures individual perceptions randomness probability theory hot hand gambler s fallacy their respective opposites
AIMX--: this paper s first contribution use data field individuals playing roulette casino demonstrate existence impact biases been previously documented lab
OWNX--: decisions field consistent biased beliefs although we observe significant individual heterogeneity population
MISC--: second contribution separately identify biases within given individual then examine their within person correlation
OWNX--: we find positive significant correlation across individuals between hot hand gambler s fallacy biases suggesting common root cause two related errors
OWNX--: we speculate source this correlation locus control suggest future research could test this speculation
OWNX--: almost every decision we make involves uncertainty some way
MISC--: yet research decision making under uncertainty demonstrates our judgments often not consistent probability theory
MISC--: intuitive ideas randomness depart systematically laws chance
OWNX--: this research suggests we developed number judgment heuristics analyzing complex real world events
MISC--: although many decisions based heuristics consistent probability theory there also situations where heuristics lead statistical illusions suboptimal actions
AIMX--: this paper investigates existence impact two statistical illusions gambler s fallacy hot hand
MISC--: both illusions characterize individuals perceptions non autocorrelated random sequences
MISC--: thus both involve perceptions sequences events rather than one time events
MISC--: gambler s fallacy belief negative autocorrelation non autocorrelated random sequence outcomes like coin flips
MISC--: example imagine jim repeatedly flipping fair coin guessing outcome before lands
MISC--: if he believes gambler s fallacy then after observing three heads row his subjective probability seeing another head less than number percent
MISC--: thus he believes tail due more likely appear next flip than head
MISC--: contrast hot hand belief positive autocorrelation non autocorrelated random sequence outcomes like winning losing
MISC--: example imagine rachel repeatedly flipping fair coin guessing outcome before lands
MISC--: if she believes hot hand then after observing three correct guesses row her subjective probability guessing correctly next flip higher than number percent
MISC--: thus she believes she hot more likely than chance guess correctly
MISC--: notice two biases not simply opposites
MISC--: gambler s fallacy describes beliefs about outcomes random process e g heads tails while hot hand describes beliefs outcomes individual like wins losses
MISC--: gambler s fallacy coin due hot hand person hot
OWNX--: purposes our study we will identify four possible biases individuals could exhibit
OWNX--: gambler s fallacy its opposite hot outcome beliefs about coin s outcomes involving negative versus positive autocorrelation random outcomes
MISC--: hot hand its opposite stock luck beliefs about individual s success involving positive versus negative autocorrelation winning losing
OWNX--: thus someone believe both gambler s fallacy after three coin flips heads tails due hot hand after three wins they will more likely correctly guess next outcome coin toss
MISC--: biases believed stem same source representativeness heuristic discussed below citation
AIMX--: this paper we use empirical data gamblers casinos examine existence prevalence correlation between gambler s fallacy hot hand beliefs
AIMX--: companion paper croson sundali citation uses same data examine aggregate market impact biases
OWNX--: contrast here we will identify biases at individual level examine within participant correlation between two
CONT--: empirical data while difficult obtain code provide important complement robustness check other methods investigating biases
MISC--: participants casinos making real decisions their own money line
MISC--: further participants represent more motivated sample than typical students at university gamblers very real incentive learn game they playing make decisions accordance their beliefs
CONT--: use casino data does however involve some limitations
OWNX--: particular we were prevented directly contacting gamblers study thus we cannot ask particular individuals why they bet how they did about their beliefs at time placing bet
MISC--: also gambling population while motivated selected subsample population at large
OWNX--: thus we will cautious our claims external validity this study
OWNX--: nonetheless we believe demonstration biases field at level individual important contribution itself
OWNX--: we also one very few papers identify multiple biases within individual characterize correlation between them
MISC--: gambler s fallacy defined incorrect belief negative autocorrelation non autocorrelated random sequence
MISC--: example individuals who believe gambler s fallacy believe after three red numbers appearing roulette wheel black number due more likely appear than red number
OWNX--: gambler s fallacy type beliefs were first observed laboratory under controlled conditions literature probability matching
OWNX--: experiments subjects were asked guess two colored lights would next illuminate
MISC--: after seeing string one outcome subjects were significantly more likely guess other effect referred literature negative recency citation
MISC--: ayton fischer citation also demonstrate existence gambler s fallacy beliefs lab when subjects choose two colors will appear next simulated roulette wheel
MISC--: gal baron citation show gambler s fallacy behavior not simply caused boredom participants their experiments were asked how they would best maximize their earnings they responded gambler s fallacy type logic
MISC--: gambler s fallacy thought caused representativeness heuristic citation
MISC--: here chance perceived self correcting process deviation one direction induces deviation opposite direction restore equilibrium citation
MISC--: thus after sequence three red numbers appearing roulette wheel black more likely occur than red because sequence red red red black more representative underlying distribution than sequence red red red red
OWNX--: we test gambler s fallacy our data looking at impact previous outcomes current bets at roulette
MISC--: people who believe gambler s fallacy should less likely bet number previously appeared
OWNX--: purposes this analysis we will examine two separate definitions hotness hot outcome hot hand
MISC--: hot outcome will simply opposite gambler s fallacy incorrect belief positive autocorrelation non autocorrelated random sequence
OWNX--: example individuals who believe hot outcome believe after three red numbers appearing roulette wheel another red number more likely appear than black number because red numbers hot
MISC--: notice here outcomes hot e g red numbers rather than individuals hot hand below
MISC--: lab literature probability matching also provides evidence favoring hot outcome beliefs
MISC--: edwards citation lindman edwards citation feldman citation all found positive recency effects probability matching tasks
OWNX--: particularly long sequences probability matching game participants were significantly more likely guess same outcome had been observed previously
OWNX--: we will test hot outcome beliefs our data looking at impact previous outcomes current bets at roulette
MISC--: if gamblers believe hot outcomes they should more likely bet outcome previously been observed
BASE--: thus positive relationship between previously observed outcomes current bets indicative belief hot outcomes
MISC--: hot hand different hot outcome
MISC--: rather than believing particular outcome hot individuals who believe hot hand believe particular person hot
MISC--: example if individual won past whatever numbers they choose bet likely win future not just numbers they ve won previously
MISC--: gilovich vallone tversky citation demonstrated individuals believe hot hand basketball shooting beliefs not correct i e basketball shooters probability success indeed serially uncorrelated
MISC--: other evidence lab shows subjects simulated blackjack game bet more after series wins than they do after series losses both when betting their own play play others citation
MISC--: further evidence hot hand laboratory experiment comes ayton fischer citation
OWNX--: participants exhibit more confident their guesses what color will next appear after string correct guesses than after string incorrect guesses
MISC--: explanations hot hand numerous
MISC--: clearly related illusion control citation where individuals believe they control outcomes fact random
MISC--: gilovich et al citation suggest hot hand also arises out representativeness heuristic just gambler s fallacy
OWNX--: they write this second explanation supported data participants asked generate strings random numbers
MISC--: strings generated produced significantly fewer runs same outcome than truly random sequence would citation
OWNX--: we will test hot hand beliefs our data looking at how betting behavior changes response wins losses
OWNX--: particular hot hand beliefs predict after winning individuals will increase number bets they place after losing decrease them
MISC--: just gambler s fallacy hot outcome opposing biases hot hand opposing bias referred here stock luck beliefs
MISC--: individuals believe they stock fixed amount luck once s spent their probability winning decreases
MISC--: thus after string wins individuals less likely win rather than more likely predicted hot hand because they exhausted their stock luck
MISC--: effect been demonstrated lab leopard citation who examines choice behavior series gambles demonstrates subjects take more risk after losing than after winning suggesting their bad luck about change their good luck about run out
OWNX--: stock luck beliefs predict after winning individuals will decrease number bets they place after loss increase them
OWNX--: thus negative relationship observed between current betting behavior previous wins losses will provide evidence this bias
MISC--: large literature identifies individual differences risk attitudes citation
MISC--: addition previous work identified individual heterogeneity biased beliefs about sequences gambles
MISC--: friedland citation uses personality inventory categorize individuals into luck oriented chance oriented
MISC--: questionnaire design he finds gamblers fallacy behavior luck oriented individuals but no behavior particular no dependence current bets past outcomes chance oriented individuals
MISC--: field previous work also found individual heterogeneity biased beliefs
MISC--: keren wagenaar citation examine blackjack play number individuals who played at least number hands changed their bets over time
MISC--: number had relationships between previous outcomes bet changes thus exhibiting bias some sort
OWNX--: fourteen them increased their bets after they won decreased them after they lost consistent hot hand while number decreased their bets after winning increased them after losing consistent stock luck
OWNX--: studies we will use our data analyze individual differences betting behavior
MISC--: only two previous papers examine field behavior at roulette
OWNX--: first observational sociological field study oldman citation informally reports both gambler s fallacy hot outcome
MISC--: he writes t he bet particular spin tends placed outcomes due either because they not occurred some time because way things running
MISC--: p number
MISC--: second source wagenaar citation discusses data number roulette players casino who stayed between number number spins each
MISC--: number players who varied their bets most he finds after win number percent bets involve increased risk hot hand number percent involve decreased risk stock luck
MISC--: after loss number percent bets involve decreased risk hot hand number percent bets do not stock luck
CONT--: however wagenaar does not present analysis how individuals differ this dimension
CONT--: while previous papers investigated gambler s fallacy hot hand biases our work makes two important original contributions
OWNX--: first provides field setting possible investigate both biases at once
MISC--: biases been analyzed together only lab citation
OWNX--: second our empirical data will allow us identify individual differences biases
MISC--: we will able examine correlation between biases within individual
OWNX--: this study we use observational data field individuals betting at roulette casino
MISC--: roulette useful game number reasons
MISC--: first serially uncorrelated unlike other casino games like blackjack baccarat where cards dealt without replacement
MISC--: second each player his her own colored chips thus tracking individual s betting behavior feasible
OWNX--: finally roulette extremely popular accessible game requires relatively little skill play unlike craps example perceived game experts
OWNX--: thus roulette likely suffer less selection bias than craps although we already selecting participants casino gambling population mentioned above unavoidable selection bias
MISC--: roulette involves dealer sometimes two wheel layout
MISC--: wheel divided into number even sectors numbered numbernumber plus number number
MISC--: each space red black number number colored green
OWNX--: wheel arranged shown figure number red black numbers alternate
MISC--: players arrive at roulette table offer dealer money either cash casino chips
MISC--: exchange they given special roulette chips betting at this wheel
MISC--: chips not valid anywhere else casino each player at table unique color chips
MISC--: players bet placing chips numbered layout wheel spun small white ball rolled around its edge
MISC--: ball lands particular number wheel winning number round announced publicly dealer
OWNX--: next dealer clears away all losing bets players who had bet winning number some configuration paid their own colored chips new round betting begins
MISC--: figure number shows typical layout along types bets made
MISC--: unlike wheel layout arranged numerical order
MISC--: players place their bets varying places layout
MISC--: bets type number number called straight up bets
MISC--: bets single number
MISC--: if number comes up wheel this bet would pay player number number number number
MISC--: when number chip bet dealer pays player number chips directly chip was bet not removed table
MISC--: bets type between number number line bets bets two numbers
MISC--: if either numbers comes up this bet pays player number number
CONT--: players also bet combinations number numbers number pay number number combinations number numbers corner numbernumbernumbernumber pay number number combinations number numbers numbernumber pay number number
OWNX--: players course bet outside bets like red black even odd low high
OWNX--: bets will not included our analysis they not bet often enough allow identification at individual level but discussed our companion paper aggregate behavior croson sundali citation
MISC--: notice all bets same expected value number number percent double zero wheel
OWNX--: since house advantage almost all bets at wheel same there no economic reason bet one way another matter at all
OWNX--: this paper we will compare actual betting behavior we observe against benchmark random betting search systematic significant deviations benchmark
