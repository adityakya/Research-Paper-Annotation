OWNX--: we conducted three studies investigate how well pictographs communicate medical screening information persons higher lower numeracy skills
OWNX--: study number we conducted number probability level higher vs lower x number reference information yes vs no x number subjective numeracy higher vs lower between subjects design
OWNX--: persons higher numeracy skills were influenced probability level but not reference information
MISC--: persons lower numeracy tended differentiate between higher lower probability when there was no reference information
OWNX--: study number consisted interviews about mental processing pictographs
OWNX--: higher numeracy was associated counting icons relying numbers depicted graph
AIMX--: study number was experiment same design study number but rather than using reference information we varied sequence task type counting first vs non counting first explore role focus numerical information
OWNX--: persons lower numeracy differentiated between higher lower risk only when they were non counting first condition
OWNX--: task sequence did not influence risk perceptions persons higher numeracy
OWNX--: sum our results suggest pictographs may useful persons higher lower numeracy
MISC--: however groups seem process graph differently
MISC--: persons higher numeracy rely more numerical information depicted graph whereas persons lower numeracy seem confused when they guided towards numbers
MISC--: patients often confronted difficult medical decisions
MISC--: many decisions made based numerical information citation
MISC--: therefore quite important this information understood correctly
MISC--: past research shown many people difficulties understanding numerical risk information citation persons low numeracy skills ability understand numbers especially challenged numerical information citation
MISC--: therefore not surprisingly more more studies show low numeracy associated less understanding medical information unfavorable decision outcomes citation
MISC--: different solutions been proposed improving communication medical information
MISC--: some authors suggest example numbers should expressed frequencies citation especially persons low numeracy conveyed graphs citation
MISC--: one special type graph combines two recommendations risk communication because graph shows frequency information b conveys numbers purely graphical way
MISC--: so called pictographs show number people affected certain medical condition larger group people citation
MISC--: therefore this type graph seems promising tool communicating medical information persons low numeracy
MISC--: several studies show pictographs help people low numeracy understand medical information citation
CONT--: however although pictographs seem improve low numerates direct understanding presented numbers e g knowledge how many persons affected certain disease not yet clear how this graph influences low numerates risk perception
MISC--: influence pictographs risk perception however may crucial because perceiving risk either high low might greater impact behavioral intentions than understanding numerical information alone citation
MISC--: generally pictographs seem evoke lower risk perceptions than other presentation formats paling perspective scale citation numerical frequencies citation
OWNX--: unfortunately not possible decide whether reported risk perception correct one because subjective nature
MISC--: handle this difficulty one conduct experiment investigate whether different levels probabilities evoke different levels perceived risk citation
OWNX--: this approach participants faced either higher lower probability then estimate their perceived risk
OWNX--: we then analyze extent participants confronted higher risk perceive risk higher than participants confronted lower risk
OWNX--: results two previous studies following this procedure using pictographs showed higher probability did not evoke higher level perceived risk than lower probability citation
CONT--: this result might suggest although some studies showed pictographs seem help persons low numeracy understand numbers depicted graph pictographs may not help them evolve clearly distinguishable risk perceptions same degree
OWNX--: thus type task used study may influence evaluation pictographs
OWNX--: role numeracy this perception process our knowledge not yet fully understood
AIMX--: we therefore conducted three studies examine influence numeracy people s perceptions new approach this question people s processing numerical medical information depicted pictographs
BASE--: examine this issue we chose context cancer screening test results some studies shown numeracy important this area citation
MISC--: numeracy defined person s ability understand process numerical concepts citation
MISC--: measured two different ways
MISC--: objective measures assess people s numeracy letting them solve mathematical tasks citation
MISC--: one problem using objective measures mail surveys respondents might use helping devices calculators
OWNX--: this would then bias resulting numeracy score
MISC--: furthermore respondents might find annoying fill questionnaires thus might simply avoid them when they opportunity do so citation
MISC--: cope this problem fagerlin colleagues citation developed subjective numeracy scale assesses self reported numeracy skills
MISC--: this measure offers advantage shorter administration less reluctance participants than objective measures citation
MISC--: other hand this measure relies entirely self reported numerical ability preference
MISC--: moreover although positively correlated objective numeracy citation does not measure exactly same construct direct measurement mathematical skills objective numeracy measures
OWNX--: short aim our first study was examine influence subjective numeracy perception cancer screening test results presented pictographs
OWNX--: following siegrist keller s approach citation we conducted experiment examine whether different levels probabilities evoke different levels perceived risk
AIMX--: reach deeper understanding into how pictographs might influence risk perception relation numeracy we conducted second study
OWNX--: we thereby directly examined processing cancer screening results depicted pictographs its association numeracy
OWNX--: finally study number we explored role sequence task numerical understanding first vs risk perception first context risk communication pictographs numeracy
OWNX--: this manifold procedure we aim broaden existing knowledge about numeracy medical decisions investigating role numeracy risk perception
