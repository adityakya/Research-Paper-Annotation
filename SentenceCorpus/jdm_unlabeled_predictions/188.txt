MISC--: subjects performed decision task citation both well rested experimentally sleep deprived state
OWNX--: we found two main results number final choice accuracy was unaffected sleep deprivation yet number estimated decision model differed significantly following sleep deprivation
MISC--: following sleep deprivation subjects placed significantly less weight new information forming their beliefs
MISC--: because altered decision process still maintains decision accuracy may suggest increased accident error rates attributed reduced sleep modern society stem reduced auxiliary function performance e g slowed reaction time reduced motor skills other components decision making rather than inability integrate multiple pieces information
MISC--: large volume evidence suggests individuals industrialized nations becoming increasingly sleep deprived
MISC--: according recent poll conducted national sleep foundation average american adult slept less than number hours per night number
MISC--: nightly average was number number hours number number hours per night number citation
MISC--: this trend significant implications given known effects sleep deprivation decreased motor cognitive performance reduced vigilance reaction time worsened mood reduced ability think flexibly citation
MISC--: indeed even number hours habitual sleep per night leads significantly diminished cognitive performance relative number number hours citation causes us wonder about more hidden decision effects sleep loss
OWNX--: nearly number million americans close number percent all adults estimated suffer some level sleep deprivation so effects sleep deprivation decision making widespread implications
MISC--: many occupations promote culture sleep deprivation e g emergency personnel air traffic controllers medical residents military personnel long haul truck drivers shift workers
MISC--: sleep deprivation costs u s economy number billion dollars annually lost productivity citation
MISC--: additionally results increased workplace accident rates citation increased absenteeism citation greater medical morbidity related costs citation even slower career advancement citation
MISC--: across numerous settings work home driving public accidents leger citation estimated costs accidents attributable sleepiness at number number billion number dollars
MISC--: sleep deprivation also been implicated several major historical disasters including space shuttle challenger explosion exxon valdez oil spill chernobyl nuclear plant explosion citation
MISC--: sum impact sleep deprivation workplace society whole while difficult measure precisely massive
AIMX--: this paper reports results laboratory study examines effects sleep deprivation information processing
MISC--: examinations flexible thinking strategy updating risk assessment relatively new sleep research citation
MISC--: past research utilized complex multi modal tasks operational settings cannot identify specific aspects decision making affected sleep deprivation
MISC--: example harrison horne citation utilize marketing simulation game they report number hours total sleep deprivation led stereotyped decisions failing integrate previous feedback resulting large financial losses production errors
MISC--: operational settings similarly global outcome measures reported citation
MISC--: recent meta analysis number studies found clinical outcomes culmination many decisions were negatively impacted physician sleep loss citation
MISC--: thus neither laboratory nor applied sleep deprivation studies measured discrete quantifiable decision parameters free confounds
MISC--: even well known iowa gambling task igt been used examine risky choice behavior sleep literature citation does not allow researcher separate risk attitude subjective probability formation latter results fact there missing information respect outcome probabilities igt
MISC--: mckenna et al citation addressed this issue showed sleep deprivation desensitizes decision maker risk
MISC--: general mechanism sleep deprivation alters decision making remains unclear
MISC--: given many real world decisions involve multiple cognitive processes important separately examine several those components effort determine may specifically impacted sleep deprivation may not
MISC--: studies examining risk preference cited above examples work
MISC--: another process found many decisions ability integrate multiple pieces information into decision
MISC--: sleep deprivation might alter subject tendencies utilize one more pieces information decision making
AIMX--: arrival new information may elicit impulsive response subjects react new evidence this impulse may altered following sleep deprivation
AIMX--: current study examines this specific aspect decision making through study bayesian updating
MISC--: experiment administered subjects both well rested after number number hours microgreek number number sigma number controlled total sleep deprivation
MISC--: comparison previous economics research we replicate bayes rule experiment grether citation
MISC--: one examine effects sleep deprivation ability integrate information into decision at least two perspectives each their own strengths weaknesses
MISC--: one involves asking whether individuals calculate true bayesian probability given base rate probabilities new sample evidence
MISC--: this requires asking subjects their judgment actual probability event occurring therefore focuses finding ideal answer problem
OWNX--: although this approach merit our interest was determining weight placed odds evidence when actual forced choice was made i e was more likely occur
MISC--: scenario more aligned many naturally occurring decision environments everyday life
MISC--: example one may decide two routes destination faster right now given prior knowledge rate traffic each route new information current day time
MISC--: surgeon may decide perform emergency procedure given prior knowledge relative success procedure new information current condition patient
MISC--: short when individuals make real decisions they must often choose specific course action i e dichotomous choice rather than probability estimate
OWNX--: influence sleep deprivation making decisions our interest
MISC--: because information updating fundamental component decision making under uncertainty this research relevant wide variety behavioral applications
MISC--: sleep research indirectly pointed towards failed information assimilation under sleep deprivation citation
MISC--: however more direct evidence needed harrison horne citation recognize lack sleep deprivation research specific decision models
MISC--: behavioral economics continues explore decision making one cannot ignore evidence indicating many decision makers often sleep deprived some degree
