OWNX--: using cognitive task mental calculation perceptual motor task stylized golf putting we examined differential proficiency using cws index several other quantitative measures performance
MISC--: cws index citation coherence criterion looks only at internal properties data without incorporating external standard
CONT--: experiment number college students n number carried out number number digit addition multiplication problems under time pressure
MISC--: experiment number experienced golfers n number also college students putted toward target nine different locations
OWNX--: within each experiment we analyzed same responses using different methods
OWNX--: arithmetic tasks accuracy information mean absolute deviation correct answer mad using coherence criterion was available golf accuracy information using correspondence criterion mean deviation target also mad was available
OWNX--: we ranked performances participants according each measure then compared orders using spearman s rs
MISC--: mental calculation cws order correlated moderately rs number mad
OWNX--: however different coherence criterion degree model fit did not correlate either cws accuracy
MISC--: putting ranking generated cws correlated number generated mad
MISC--: consensual answers were also available both experiments rankings they generated correlated highly those mad
OWNX--: coherence vs correspondence distinction did not map well onto criteria performance evaluation
MISC--: evaluate work plumber therapist surgeon necessary assess job performance
MISC--: while all professionals their creative moments most fields ability perform practiced task consistently well hallmark expert
MISC--: performance assessment also key determining whether training program technical innovation worthwhile
MISC--: ideally assessment objective rather than matter opinion
MISC--: quantitative assessment performance attends measurable aspects work typically bottom line outcome labor
MISC--: how many leaks were stopped
MISC--: how many patients were cured
MISC--: outcome measures capture what hammond citation refers correspondence competence they focus directly consequences
MISC--: outcomes also compared theory based standards example updating opinions should governed bayes s theorem
MISC--: hammond citation refers this type standard coherence criterion
MISC--: two types criteria optimality compare performance gold standard compelling benchmark against measure behavior
MISC--: indeed some researchers argue performance measured meaningfully only when gold standard been agreed upon citation
AIMX--: just hammond citation hoped correspondence coherence distinction would help clarify debates about proper way evaluate scientific theory this paper we invoke distinction hope clarifying debates about how assess performance
MISC--: many professional domains gold standards simply not available
OWNX--: what outcome reflects quality film review grade assigned instructor sentence imposed magistrate
MISC--: weiss shanteau citation responded challenge gold standards elusive constructing empirical index referred cws does not incorporate ground truth
MISC--: they suggested proficiency evaluative skill at its core
MISC--: whatever task one must attend relevant aspects situation decide what do
MISC--: viewing evaluation akin what measuring instrument does weiss shanteau citation identified two necessary properties expert judgment discrimination responding differently different stimuli consistency responding similarly similar stimuli
MISC--: cws index presented equation number combines two properties ratio format
MISC--: ratio large when judge discriminates effectively reduced when judge inconsistent
MISC--: weiss shanteau stressed two properties not conceptually independent
MISC--: easy enough adopt strategy trades off one property at expense other but achieving both at same time requires accurate evaluation stimuli essence expert judgment number when they originally proposed cws index weiss shanteau were intentionally non committal about measures discrimination inconsistency
MISC--: trade off implied ratio definition heart concept any measures reflect two properties will do
MISC--: applications generate numerical data including present ones discrimination inconsistency been operationalized using terms familiar analysis variance
MISC--: experimental design suitable cws analysis may simple presentation each several stimuli more than once
MISC--: discrimination means different stimuli responded differently
MISC--: accordingly discrimination captured mean square between stimuli
MISC--: inconsistency implies given stimulus presented multiple times inspires different responses various occasions
MISC--: inconsistency captured mean square between replications
OWNX--: cws approach resembles coherence criterion examines purely internal properties behavior
OWNX--: however differs other coherence criteria while proficient performance inexorably generates high values cws there no theory specifying optimal behavior
MISC--: our view performance ought tied external world experts should follow prescriptive model their task
CONT--: however not always possible evaluator know best answers applicable model often unknown well
MISC--: absence optimal answers does not diminish practical importance having capability evaluate members large class professionals who provide opinions about status achievements people citation
MISC--: more popular approach evaluating subjective domains compare someone s responses those other people
MISC--: opinions often converge toward truth citation
MISC--: consensual answers often been proposed surrogates correct answers citation although logic doing so been criticized citation
MISC--: gist criticism simply people may agree poor answers
MISC--: one may view consensus coherence criterion postulating there exists across people common latent structure underlying their opinions citation
OWNX--: current project we employed tasks there were indisputably optimal responses namely mental calculation golf putting
MISC--: accuracy arithmetic calculation customarily assessed using coherence criterion correct answers dictated abstract logical rules mathematics
MISC--: accuracy putt usually assessed using correspondence criterion how close ball gets its target
MISC--: goal present research was shed light cws s ability capture subjective domains examining objective domains
