MISC--: currently disparity exists between process level models decision researchers use describe predict decision behavior methods implemented metrics collected test models
MISC--: current work seeks remedy this disparity combining advantages work decision research mouse tracing paradigms contingent information display cognitive psychology eye tracking paradigms reading scene perception
OWNX--: particular we introduce new decision moving window paradigm presents stimulus information contingent eye fixations
OWNX--: we provide data first application this method risky decision making show how compares basic eye tracking mouse tracing methods
OWNX--: we also enumerate practical theoretical analytic advantages this method offers above beyond both mouse tracing occlusion basic eye tracking information without occlusion
AIMX--: we include use new metrics offer more precision than those typically calculated mouse tracing data well those not possible feasible within mouse tracing paradigm
MISC--: decision researchers must often rely outcome measures i e choice preference etc
MISC--: infer how decisions made individuals
MISC--: advent increased computing power availability usability allowed decision researchers develop methods examine underlying processes attention information acquisition deliberation etc
MISC--: rather than relying solely observable outcomes
MISC--: process tracing paradigms information boards mouse tracing methods citation eye tracking methods citation verbal protocols citation been utilized decision research mechanisms capturing decision process
MISC--: need verify theoretical advances specify how i e process addition what i e outcome produced great interest tracing methods citation
