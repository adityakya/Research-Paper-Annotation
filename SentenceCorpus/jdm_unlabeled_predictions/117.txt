MISC--: three experiments tested if individuals show violations transitivity choices between risky gambles linked designs
MISC--: binary gambles varied probability win higher better prize value higher prize value lower prize
MISC--: each design varied two factors third fixed
MISC--: designs linked using same values different designs
MISC--: linked designs allow one determine if lexicographic semiorder model describe violations transitivity more than one design using same parameters
OWNX--: addition two experiments tested interactive independence critical property implied all lexicographic semiorder models
MISC--: very few people showed systematic violations transitivity only one person out number showed violations transitivity two designs could linked lexicographic semiorder
OWNX--: however person violated interactive independence did majority other participants
MISC--: most individuals showed systematic violations assumptions stochastic independence stationarity choice responses
MISC--: means investigators should evaluate models respect response patterns response combinations rather than focusing entirely choice proportions
MISC--: descriptive theories risky decision making divided into two groups those satisfy transitivity preference those do not
MISC--: transitivity preference assumption if person prefers b prefers b c then person should prefer c apart random error
CONT--: we use symbol x number b denote preference so property denoted follows x number b b b x number b c x number d number x number b c
MISC--: theories represent each gamble single number automatically imply transitivity
MISC--: theories assume x number b b x number d number ua greater than ub where ua ub numerical values utilities two gambles
MISC--: expected utility theory eu cumulative prospect theory cpt transfer attention exchange model tax well many other theories fall this class theories satisfy transitivity citation
MISC--: theories represent choice terms contrasts between components alternatives however need not satisfy transitivity preference
MISC--: theories violate transitivity include family lexicographic semiorder ls models priority heuristic regret theory rt stochastic difference model sdm others citation
