MISC--: individual differences cognitive abilities skills predict normatively superior logically consistent judgments decisions
MISC--: current experiment investigates processes mediate individual differences risky choices
OWNX--: we assessed working memory span numeracy cognitive impulsivity conducted protocol analysis trace variations conscious deliberative processes
MISC--: people higher cognitive abilities made more choices consistent expected values however expected value choices rarely resulted expected value calculations
MISC--: instead cognitive ability choice relationship was mediated number simple considerations made during decision making e g transforming probabilities considering relative size gains
MISC--: results imply even simple lotteries superior risky decisions associated cognitive abilities controlled cognition reflect metacognitive dynamics elaborative heuristic search processes rather than normative calculations
MISC--: modes cognitive control e g dual process dynamics implications process models risky decision making e g priority heuristic discussed
MISC--: human decision making constrained its bounded rationality does not always follow normative prescriptions citation
MISC--: nevertheless individual differences cognitive abilities skills predict normatively superior judgment decision making citation
MISC--: variety theories dual process theories attribute individual differences deliberative processes citation however link between decision processes abilities largely uninvestigated
OWNX--: what cognitive processes give rise relationship between cognitive abilities superior decision making under risk
MISC--: previous research examined individual differences decision making under risk lotteries known probabilities
MISC--: low stakes lotteries normative expected utility processes assumed approximated calculations multiply probabilities potential gains losses i e expected value calculations citation
MISC--: frederick demonstrated expected value choices associated scores cognitive reflection test designed measure one s reliance more consciously controlled processes rather than automatic first impressions citation
MISC--: three problem cognitive reflection test known correlate other general cognitive ability measures consists mathematical problems immediate intuitive response incorrect
MISC--: frederick demonstrated higher scoring individuals did not exhibit clear non normative risk asymmetry gains losses predicted prospect theory citation
MISC--: when given choice between gain number versus number percent chance number gain prospect theory predicted risk aversion selection certain number
MISC--: however people higher cognitive reflection scores more often selected options higher expected values i e probability multiplied potential risky gain number compared lower scoring individuals
MISC--: there several candidate mechanisms may account link between cognitive abilities superior decision making under risk
MISC--: example one make expected value choices performing expected value calculations
MISC--: frederick citation suggests computation expected values may play role although he notes not likely only factor
MISC--: more generally stanovich west citation suggest individual differences normative judgments decisions often arise working memory capacity limitations computation implying high ability individuals may make expected value choices via expected value calculations
MISC--: other research indicates individual differences risky decision making may also arise variations one s general knowledge understanding probabilities i e one s numeracy citation
MISC--: people high numeracy particularly ability comprehend transform probabilities less affected attribute framing because they readily transform items number percent correct into number percent incorrect translate percentages frequencies vice versa
