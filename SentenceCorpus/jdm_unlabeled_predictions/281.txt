OWNX--: this paper examines conditions do do not lead accurate judgments frequency jof judgments duration jod
MISC--: three experiments duration frequency visually presented stimuli varied orthogonally within subjects design
MISC--: experiment number reveals asymmetric judgment pattern
OWNX--: jofs reflected actual presentation frequency quite accurately were unbiased exposure duration
OWNX--: conversely jods were almost insensitive actual exposure duration were systematically biased presentation frequency
OWNX--: we show however tendency towards symmetric judgment pattern obtained manipulating encoding conditions
MISC--: sustaining attention during encoding experiment number enhancing richness encoded stimuli experiment number increases judgment sensitivity jod yields biases both directions jof biased exposure duration jod biased presentation frequency
OWNX--: implications findings underlying memory mechanisms discussed
MISC--: event frequency duration fundamental importance behavioral adaptation citation
MISC--: predators instance increase their chances survival if they approach areas where prey resides more frequently longer periods time
MISC--: conversely prey should strive avoid areas where predators roam frequently consistently
MISC--: consider individual who must decide where go hunting probability maximizing individual s yield function frequency length time duration prey lingers certain area
MISC--: assume individual experienced hunter who often visited different areas past observed behavior prey animals
MISC--: further assume observations made would represent valid sample prey animals migrations
MISC--: order properly adapt his own behavior environment hunter should use frequentistic temporal information his subsequent choice citation
MISC--: this requires two abilities first individual must capable discriminating differences frequency duration second representations frequency duration must stored memory so they used later judgment decision making
OWNX--: psychologists various fields studied processing duration frequency extensively
MISC--: their approaches however differ
MISC--: research animal cognition neuropsychology focuses primarily discrimination short term storage citation
MISC--: cognitive psychologists often interested memory processes citation whereas jdm researchers mainly consider judgmental heuristics citation
MISC--: fields host different theoretical perspectives apply different research paradigms arrive at diverging interpretations phenomena
MISC--: consider example case frequency judgment
MISC--: cognitive psychologists normally employ learning procedures induce frequency knowledge laboratory usually find participants subsequently make quite accurate judgments
MISC--: they explain their findings reference general models memory citation
MISC--: conversely jdm researchers often investigate factors cause changes judgment accuracy explain their results reference judgmental heuristics citation
MISC--: separation between research fields been often lamented but there increasing number researchers striving towards integration both methodological theoretical level citation this paper we report studies using research paradigm cognitive psychology induce knowledge about frequency duration
OWNX--: we compare judgments two related domains judgments duration jod judgments frequency jof
OWNX--: we manipulate conditions encoding assess their effects judgmental patterns
OWNX--: specifically we compare jod jof regarding differences their retrospective sensitivity differences their susceptibility biases
OWNX--: this approach we seek increase our knowledge fundamental memory processes
MISC--: knowledge may help achieve better understanding variations judgment
OWNX--: remainder introduction we give brief overview state research processing frequency duration arrive at working hypothesis regarding storage entities memory
MISC--: ample evidence indicates organisms remarkably good at discriminating differences frequency duration citation
MISC--: like animals citation adult humans citation even young children citation capable effectively discriminating low range frequencies n less than number
MISC--: similarly humans like many other species able discriminate temporal information across wide range intervals circadian timing timing seconds even milliseconds citation
MISC--: discrimination very short durations millisecond range particular seems very accurate citation
MISC--: all together research findings suggest common mental mechanism drives discrimination both stimulus dimensions frequency duration citation
MISC--: granting findings discrimination one may tempted assume frequency duration would also affect storage memory similar fashion
MISC--: according common path hypothesis figure number frequency duration would commensurate effects stimulus representation r subsequent judgment citation instance they may both change accessibility strength event memory
MISC--: changes strength could modeled different theoretical approaches memory
MISC--: connectionist network models frequency duration may conceived change strength associations among r its features other constituents network citation
MISC--: multiple trace models citation strength primarily conceived function number traces representing stimulus event at least if encoding response criteria constant
MISC--: other things being equal trace number assumed increase function encounter frequency
MISC--: may also increase function duration because prolonged exposure may entail repetitive encoding event
MISC--: regardless underlying mechanism common path hypothesis assumes same property memory used subsequent judgments
MISC--: accordingly jof jod should made through assessments strength r memory
MISC--: one main prediction derived common path hypothesis jof jod should symmetrically biased
MISC--: accordingly jof should biased exposure duration while jod should biased exposure frequency
CONT--: empirical evidence common path hypothesis however mixed
OWNX--: supporting evidence stems mostly jdm research heuristics assumed use memory strength predictor quantitative judgments
MISC--: example when applying availability heuristic citation individual thought estimate criterion assessing ease stimulus stimuli rehearsed memory
MISC--: fluency heuristic citation employs similar process more fluently stimulus processed due previous exposure higher estimation criterion citation
OWNX--: line this notion some studies provided evidence exposure duration biases subsequent jof
MISC--: example williams durso citation varied duration words number number number number sec between subjects
MISC--: they found subsequent frequency judgments were systematically biased duration
MISC--: specifically longer category exemplars were shown presentation higher estimated size category higher probability exemplars could reproduced free recall test
MISC--: lewandowsky smith citation found similar effects earlier
MISC--: employing within subjects design they varied exposure duration number number number number number sec assessed effects frequency judgments recall
OWNX--: both measures were positively correlated exposure duration
OWNX--: similarily jod were found systematically biased frequency
MISC--: ornstein citation showed retrospective judgments time intervals reflected number available events filled episode
OWNX--: hintzman citation reported evidence showing jod systematically reflected exposure frequency stimulus but see discussion this paper next section
OWNX--: taken together findings support assumptions common path hypothesis because jof jod seem behave symmetrically regard biases
MISC--: conclusive test however requires us consider two other aspects judgment pattern
MISC--: one relative strength biases other judgment sensitivity judgment sensitivity refers degree experienced differences duration frequency reproduced judgments
MISC--: this end one must compare jof jod within same experiment
MISC--: approach was applied earlier memory research
CONT--: seminal paper hintzman citation varied frequency four levels number number number number repetitions duration five levels number number number number number seconds within subjects design
OWNX--: after presentation he asked participants either judge frequency each word occurred duration was shown average trial
OWNX--: hintzman found jof showed remarkable sensitivity actual differences exposure repetition
CONT--: moreover jof were only weakly affected differences duration
MISC--: conversely judgment sensitivity was comparatively lower jod
OWNX--: another difference already noted previous section jod were systematically influenced biased actual frequency
MISC--: hintzman citation concluded asymmetric pattern results differences retrospective sensitivity uni directional bias violates common path hypothesis suggests frequency duration affect memory different fashion
MISC--: hintzman reported similar results subsequent studies citation
OWNX--: all together empirical evidence this line research suggests frequency duration stored differently memory
MISC--: findings reported so far form incoherent picture
MISC--: duration biases jof sometimes occur sometimes do not
MISC--: jod seem more susceptible biases than jof but there also evidence opposite citation
MISC--: there several possible explanations mixed evidence
MISC--: important one type judgment task differs between studies
CONT--: jod some studies use retrospective tasks citation some use prospective tasks citation
MISC--: jof most studies documenting duration biases jof used set size tasks
MISC--: participants estimated size categories containing different exemplars citation
MISC--: contrast duration biases jof less pronounced tasks assess judgment event frequencies citation
CONT--: another possible explanation encoding conditions may differ across tasks studies
MISC--: encoding frequency requires comparatively little attention stimulus
MISC--: one must simply realize stimulus occurs
MISC--: encoding duration however requires individual additionally sustains attention stimulus entire period its presence
MISC--: differences procedures materials may differentially affect individual s inclination attend stimuli proportionate actual duration
MISC--: literature time perception widespread notion attention crucial variable time processing citation
AIMX--: consequently differences result patterns might caused differences encoding rather than differences memory
OWNX--: without systematically considering encoding conditions might premature conclusion dismiss common path hypothesis
OWNX--: present research focuses role encoding conditions jod jof
OWNX--: three experiments we varied total duration frequency stimuli orthogonally within same experimental design
MISC--: specifically presentation stimuli differed regard repetition frequency number number number times total summed duration they appeared screen number number number sec
MISC--: resulting number frequency x number duration factorial design was always implemented within subjects
MISC--: following stimuli presentation participants made jof jod
MISC--: specifically they judged frequency event s occurrence its total duration exps number number number its single average duration exp number we generally assess pattern judgment central dependent variable
MISC--: takes two dimensions into account judgment sensitivity biases
MISC--: judgment sensitivity refers extent individuals able reproduce differences stimulus dimensions their judgments
MISC--: biases indicators type memory representation underlying judgment
OWNX--: experiment number serves baseline study we did not control encoding conditions
MISC--: experiment number compares different conditions focus attention during encoding
MISC--: experiment number compares different types stimulus formats differ likelihood holding observer s attention stimuli during encoding
