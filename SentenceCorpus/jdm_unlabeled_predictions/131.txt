MISC--: investors like any decision maker feel regret when they compare outcome investment what outcome would been had they invested differently
AIMX--: we argue show this counterfactual comparison process most likely take place when decision maker s expectations violated
OWNX--: across five scenario experiments we found decision makers were influenced only forgone investment outcomes when realized investment fell short expected result
MISC--: however when their investments exceeded prior expectations effect foregone investment regret disappeared
MISC--: addition experiment number found individual differences need maximize further moderated effects their expectations maximizers always take into account forgone investment
MISC--: final experiment found when probed make counterfactual comparisons also investments exceed expectations may lead regret
MISC--: together experiments reveal insights into comparative processes leading decision regret
MISC--: regret negative emotion most us familiar
MISC--: highly relevant emotion context decision making been widely studied psychologists economists consumer behavior researchers
MISC--: regret unpleasant feeling associated wish undo regretted event strong tendency metaphorically kick oneself wanting get second chance citation
MISC--: this makes regret uniquely linked decisions made been shown powerful predictor behavior
MISC--: zeelenberg pieters citation summarized scattered findings theories concerning regret its impact decision making proposed integrative theory regret regulation citation
MISC--: their proposition number p number they state regret comparison based emotion self blame experienced when people realize imagine their present situation would been better had they decided differently past
MISC--: investor who thinks example if only i had bought google stock i would earned much more feels regret
MISC--: theory regret regulation was developed understand how consumers deal regret proposes strategies used regulate citation
MISC--: fully understand impact regret important further develop insights into psychology this emotion processes may moderate
OWNX--: we discuss here how prior expectations about outcomes decisions play moderating role
MISC--: let us start fact regret counterfactual emotion citation
OWNX--: feel regret one needs run mental simulation what happened what could happened instead then compare two
OWNX--: hence forgone outcome becomes reference point against regret computed
CONT--: this how regret been conceptualized early economic regret theories citation also been well established empirically citation
MISC--: this comparing decision outcomes regret rejoicing may itself consequential comparative mind set may actually carry over subsequent decisions citation
MISC--: interestingly lin huang zeelenberg citation found experience regret also affected other standards comparison
MISC--: research revealed not only counterfactual comparisons feed into regret but also comparisons obtained outcome prior held expectations
MISC--: through online survey they interviewed number stock investors security company
MISC--: investors answered several questions concerning their chosen forgone investments
MISC--: results showed forgone outcomes considered but non chosen investments indeed influenced intensity regret felt over their investment
MISC--: but this relevant here priori expectations concerning chosen investment were also significantly related regret investors felt over their financial decisions
MISC--: larger difference between return investment expectations more intense regret
MISC--: huang tseng citation found similar effects experimental field study number managers
MISC--: comparisons obtained outcomes prior held expectancies been linked literature emotional response disappointment citation but not yet regret citation
MISC--: this interesting because regret disappointment many ways related though clearly distinct emotions both serve role decision making citation
MISC--: ample research also reviewed zeelenberg pieters citation their proposition number p number reads regret distinct related other specific emotions anger disappointment envy guilt sadness shame general negative affect basis its appraisals experiential content behavioral consequences
OWNX--: may well case regret resembles disappointment sense experience sensitive expectancy violations
MISC--: whether both emotions respond similarly comparisons expectations forgone alternatives will examined experiment number
OWNX--: two studies citation best our knowledge first highlight fact expectations may impact feelings regret but note this research remains mute respect underlying psychological processes
OWNX--: also data collected studies were primarily correlational precluding strong causal conclusions
BASE--: present study we thus take stock apparent discrepancy between findings huang tseng lin et al prior work regret
OWNX--: do this we investigate experimentally impact expected outcomes violations expectancies investor regret disappointment hope shed some light psychological processes involved
