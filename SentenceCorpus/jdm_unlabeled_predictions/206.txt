MISC--: people been shown delay decision making wait missing noninstrumental attribute information information would not altered their decision if known at outset this delay originally attributed uncertainty obscuring one s true preference citation
OWNX--: test this account relative alternative delay arises low confidence one s preference citation we manipulated information certainty magnitude penalty delay latter intended reduce influence easily resolved sources delay magnify any influence uncertainty
OWNX--: contrary expectations results were largely inconsistent uncertainty account under low penalty delay did not depend information certainty under high penalty delay rate was actually much lower when information was uncertain
MISC--: explain latter we propose people use strategy resolving choice under uncertainty does not require establishing confident preference each value missing information
MISC--: findings related others choice difficulty been found major source delay
MISC--: pending decisions how much attribute information should decision maker gather before eventually committing choice alternative
MISC--: this common dilemma much relevant information exists world yet some will not ultimately affect one s choice
MISC--: term information instrumentality refers whether not some attribute information could actually alter choice preference citation reasonable strategy wait only instrumental information
MISC--: contrast strategy however typical decision maker been shown delay choice obtain noninstrumental information
MISC--: this been documented bastardi shafir citation across wide range decision situations including consumer choice applicant selection ultimatum games everyday contexts
MISC--: example was found when hypothetical course was going taught either very popular instructor less popular one but was not yet known instructor would teaching majority individuals postponed choice
MISC--: missing information was noninstrumental was illustrated fact when less desirable instructor was known outset teaching course no opportunity defer was available individuals overwhelmingly chose enroll course
BASE--: interest here why choice delay occurs context noninstrumental information research we present speaks this important question
MISC--: particular individuals actually waiting information per se
MISC--: they waiting other reasons
MISC--: bastardi shafir citation proposed individuals wait specifically obtain noninstrumental information phenomenon emerges because information uncertainty obscures decision makers true preference
MISC--: rather than try resolve their preference decision makers postpones choice hope any additional information will clarify situation we refer this attribute uncertainty account
MISC--: tykocinski ruffle citation contrast developed alternative account we refer here confidence account
MISC--: this account waiting occurs gain not information face uncertainty but rather gain confidence non ideal alternative through deliberation occur even when all information known
MISC--: consistent their account they found choice delay occurred even when decision makers knew outset less desirable attribute favored option had already become available some cases rates deferral certain condition were found high those uncertain one
MISC--: furthermore they found less confident decision makers were their initial preference well longer stated delay period day week more likely they were postpone choice
MISC--: there currently limited mixed evidence regarding influence information uncertainty source choice delay above beyond low confidence
MISC--: because only tykocinski ruffle citation used control condition could discriminate between accounts extent attribute uncertainty underlies delay behavior across range contexts remains largely unclear
MISC--: expand breadth contexts sources delay explored further evaluate evidence attribute uncertainty account relative low confidence account present research considers delay behavior situations there some external reason not postpone choice relative those little reason not delay
MISC--: introduction penalty delay ecologically important one penalties abound everyday experience e g hold fees consumer purchases charges running internet searches information risk course filling all available seats full account delay behavior should able accommodate data context penalties
MISC--: more central present work context methodologically interesting desire avoid delay penalties motivate people make more serious attempts at resolving choice difficulties than they might otherwise do
OWNX--: result not only does introduction penalty manipulation potential extend noninstrumental information effect high penalty context but also potential dissociate two sources delay
MISC--: particular large penalty might produce greater decreases confidence related delay than attribute uncertainty because confidence related delay arguably easier resolve under pressure because preference already known than delay driven attribute uncertainty
OWNX--: we conducted two experiments delay behavior context noninstrumental information manipulating both presence significant penalty delay information certainty
OWNX--: experiment number course registration scenario penalty manipulation involved risk participants were informed either there was high risk loss course alternative over time risk was minimal
OWNX--: experiment number consumer purchase scenario penalty manipulation instead involved cost participants were informed either high negligible cost put item hold
MISC--: both experiments uncertain information condition value noninstrumental attribute information would not known until next day certain information condition was known least desirable value
OWNX--: tykocinski ruffle citation we reasoned delay certain condition consistent confidence source delay although any additional delay uncertain condition reasonably attributed attribute uncertainty we expected evidence both sources each level penalty
OWNX--: assuming evidence two sources delay we further predicted penalty manipulation would reveal dissociation between strategies namely disproportionate decrease delay certain condition where low confidence only source delay grounds might easier resolve choice difficulty when at least tentative preference been identified than when none been selected
