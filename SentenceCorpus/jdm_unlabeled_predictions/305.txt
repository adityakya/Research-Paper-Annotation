MISC--: fiedler et al citation reviewed evidence utilization contingency inference strategy termed pseudocontingencies pcs
OWNX--: pcs more frequent levels implication less frequent levels assumed associated
MISC--: pcs been obtained using wide range task settings dependent measures
MISC--: yet readiness decision makers rely pcs poorly understood
OWNX--: computer simulation explored two potential sources subjective validity pcs
OWNX--: first pcs shown perform above chance level when task infer sign moderate strong population contingencies sample observations
MISC--: second contingency inferences based pcs inferences based cell frequencies shown partially agree across samples
MISC--: intriguingly this criterion convergent validity products random sampling error highlighting inductive nature contingency inferences
MISC--: accurate contingency assessment prerequisite explain past control present predict future citation
MISC--: adaptive cognition perspective assessing contingencies amounts inferring relationship between two variables population sample observations drawn population citation
MISC--: if task was evaluate relation between drinking one two beverages say red wine beer developing migraine not contingency may inferred recalling instances wine beer consumption followed not followed migraine
OWNX--: epistemologically then contingency sample more precisely specific contingency index used decision maker used proxy contingency general population instances
OWNX--: example degree last number instances alcohol consumption proportion developing migraine was higher after red wine than after beer one might conclude general red wine more conductive migraine than beer
MISC--: not only x number p index this example but most contingency indices this inference seems unproblematic sign size sample value unbiased estimates population value citation
MISC--: what might more problematic quality grade information required
MISC--: virtually all traditional contingency indices require information about joint occurrences
MISC--: other words every instance sample necessary know levels both variables
MISC--: example every consumption instance one needs sure whether red wine beer had been consumed whether was followed migraine not
MISC--: however due several factors e g delay between observing variables large amount variables considered information about joint occurrences might not available at time judgment preventing use common contingency indices
OWNX--: remainder we will discuss validity alternative strategy contingency inferences applicable even under impoverished conditions pseudocontingencies
MISC--: pcs denote using skew greater numbers one level than other case dichotomous variables sample base rates pair variables infer contingency
MISC--: obvious using base rates pcs do not require information about joint occurrences
OWNX--: however because base rates largely independent contingencies less obvious why pcs should used at all
OWNX--: while independence true descriptively at population level we will show random sampling error necessarily causes population contingencies translate into skewed sample base rates
MISC--: intriguingly sample base rates skewed sampling process enable pcs successfully indicate moderate strong population contingencies
MISC--: another consequence strategies rely joint occurrences mostly agree pcs predictions across samples
