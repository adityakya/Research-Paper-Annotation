MISC--: very small but cumulated decreases food intake may sufficient erase obesity over period years
OWNX--: we examine effect slight changes accessibility different foods pay weight food salad bar cafeteria serving adults lunch period
CONT--: making food slightly more difficult reach varying its proximity about number inches changing serving utensil spoon tongs modestly but reliably reduces intake range number number percent
MISC--: given this effect possible making calorie dense foods less accessible low calorie foods more accessible over extended period time would result significant weight loss
MISC--: obesity detrimental health its prevalence been growing steadily united states elsewhere over recent decades
MISC--: national health nutrition examination surveys nhanes estimate percentage obese adults between ages number number america increased number number citation number number number citation
MISC--: obesity second leading cause preventable deaths increases risk coronary heart disease type ii diabetes other serious medical conditions citation
MISC--: although there no doubt obesity represents serious health hazard framing problem obesity epidemic misleading
MISC--: obesity does not two critical properties epidemics number not contagious number its growth over time years decades not rapid s shaped curve but instead very slow steady
MISC--: most common medical treatment obesity dieting
MISC--: yet most studies assessing this treatment find ineffective
MISC--: even when dieters lose weight losses rarely maintained citation
MISC--: one review even concludes only rate weight regain not fact weight regain question citation
MISC--: according gallup polls percentage americans seriously trying lose weight increased between citation number but americans got heavier nevertheless citation
MISC--: promising alternative approach obesity problem not focus blame obese individual but rather focus environment principal treatable cause
OWNX--: recent years group researchers independently advocated focus environment control national waistline
MISC--: originally proposed hill peters citation approach been endorsed one form another brownell citation levitsky citation rolls citation rozin et al number wansink citation young nestle citation
MISC--: estimates increase body weight per year americans been computed they vary depending time period measured racial age properties sample
MISC--: based nhanes cardia data bases annual weight gain estimates american adults vary number number pounds number number kg number number pounds number number kg per year citation
MISC--: creeping increase obesity could halted retrospect could been prevented very modest reduction calories range number number kilocalories day depending many factors including assumptions about efficiency extracting energy ingested foods citation
MISC--: thus reduction food intake starting twenty years ago number number apples per week number number number oz cokes per week all else equal would completely eliminated growth obesity united states
MISC--: environmental alternative its most common probably most practical form involves interventions modest but cumulative effects food intake corresponding modest annual gains weight
MISC--: number environmental interventions been shown decrease food intake meal
MISC--: best documented environmental influence portion size
MISC--: experiments both laboratory real world settings established increasing portion size increases consumption citation
MISC--: portion size also been linked bmi differences field studies
MISC--: french who consume more total fat slimmer figures than their american counterparts systematically substantially smaller portion sizes restaurants food purchased individual portion sizes cookbooks citation
MISC--: slimmer status french strongly suggests they eat fewer calories than americans probably part because they consume smaller portion sizes
MISC--: focus present studies not portion size but influence accessibility meaning ease food item accessed food choice intake
MISC--: number existing studies implicate accessibility determinant consumption
MISC--: most operationalize ease access terms proximity i e spatial location translates into effort
MISC--: early work manipulating effort was motivated schachter s citation theory obesity predicted obese individuals would reduce intake more than normal weight individuals effort obtain food increased
OWNX--: general manipulations used studies involved substantial differences effort
MISC--: nisbett citation showed obese individuals ate fewer sandwiches if they had walk refrigerator get them while normals were unaffected
MISC--: similarly schachter friedman citation showed obese individuals consumed less shelled than unshelled almonds but there was no effect normals
MISC--: schachter friedman handler number showed caucasian patrons eating at chinese restaurant obese patrons were less likely use chopsticks presumably require more effort than normal weight patrons
MISC--: another study supporting schachter view was demonstration obese individuals eat fewer cashews when they individually wrapped normals do not but study also found no reduction either group wrapped versus unwrapped chocolates citation
OWNX--: other studies testing schachter hypothesis show no differences environmental influence obese versus normal subjects
MISC--: levitz citation meyers stunkard coll citation showed reduction low calorie dessert consumption when they were placed at back four row deep dessert display opposed front cafeteria setting
OWNX--: neither study reported difference between obese normal weight persons
MISC--: levitz citation also reported when lid was ice cream cooler cafeteria setting reduced ice cream intake substantially both obese normal weight individuals
MISC--: studies done outside schachter framework also show effects effort accessibility
MISC--: meiselman et al citation reported large decreases intake potato chips candy cafeteria setting when they were made quite inaccessible locating them some distance main serving line
MISC--: engell et al citation found individuals drink more water while eating if water pitcher table versus number number feet away
MISC--: more recently wansink painter lee citation demonstrated secretaries consume more candy when bowl their desk opposed at another location room
CONT--: access potentially operationalized subtler ways examples include changing proximity matter inches i e changing ease food reached how much what direction one must stretch reach changing ease transfer i e how easy move food serving location plate mouth
MISC--: work levitz citation meyers stunkard coll citation referred above suggests modest changes positioning foods influence food intake
MISC--: all successful manipulations accessibility referred here were shown effective single meals
MISC--: we do not know whether people would compensate reduction intake subsequently increased food intake decreased exercise changes efficiency utilization energy
MISC--: this addressed discussion
MISC--: present studies explore effects small usually unnoticed environmental changes
MISC--: changes called nudges citation because they subtly encourage consumption less calorie dense food without altering choice set
OWNX--: hence our title nudge nobesity i
MISC--: companion paper nudge nobesity ii citation instantiates nudges manipulating order presentation items menu real world setting reports increased intake items presented at top bottom food category list opposed middle positions
AIMX--: we operationalize accessibility proximity i e requiring longer shorter reach three studies fourth study we operationalize ease transfer i e how easy move food one location another
