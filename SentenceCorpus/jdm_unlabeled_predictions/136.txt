MISC--: this paper examines effect information processing styles citation adherence bias judgments particularly reverse biases i e when two choice questions comprise identical normative components set different situations yield seemingly opposite behavioral biases
OWNX--: we found consistent evidence negative correlation between rational score adherence reverse biases well overall biases all three pairs reverse biases tested
OWNX--: further this effect rational thinking was more pronounced high experiential individuals high rational high experiential participants committed fewer biases than all other participants
OWNX--: results lend weight our claim low rational individuals who more sensitive context more prone utilize some attribute provided information when uncalled but at same time tend ignore give too little weight when crucial factor normative decision process
OWNX--: one our colleagues recently complained he finds jdm field rather confusing
MISC--: his view each time new behavioral irregularity found jdm researchers classify their findings new heuristic
MISC--: case point when people exhibit belief positive recency researchers tend assume they fallen prey hot hand effect citation
MISC--: when individuals exhibit belief negative recency they said victim gambler s fallacy citation
OWNX--: what learned biases lead opposite behavioral directions
MISC--: do they reflect signal noise
MISC--: behavioral traps genuine flip sides coin everyday life
MISC--: how do individual differences shape direction particular bias
MISC--: different individuals prone biases different directions
AIMX--: this paper addresses this puzzle examining effect information processing style adherence rate reverse biases said occur when two choice questions made up identical normative components set different situation yield seemingly opposite behavioral biases
MISC--: typically two imperfectly correlated attributes involved number people affected choice option proportion people affected
MISC--: each two attributes normatively relevant one one judgment
OWNX--: two biases involve some attention normatively irrelevant attribute each case
BASE--: reverse biases we define them thus different situation discussed baron citation illustrated ratio bias opposite directions citation hot hand vs gambler s fallacy citation action vs omission bias citation
MISC--: cases biases opposite directions occur same task example some people favor harms caused omission over lesser harms caused action while few others favor harms action over lesser harms omission
MISC--: demonstration opposite biases requires methods statistical analysis individuals citation
MISC--: existence individual differences utilization heuristic thinking been demonstrated variety judgmental biases
MISC--: include risk perception citation risk seeking avoidance citation binary guessing citation variance heuristic thinking citation
MISC--: however traditional studies heuristic thinking biases mainly use group level statistics confirm hypothesis number participants exhibiting cognitive biases each group cannot due chance
OWNX--: we suggest individual who adheres one direction bias not less prone exhibit its reverse bias
AIMX--: specifically we argue individual differences information processing styles together contextual factors play important role determining adherence rate biases general will thus affect both directions reverse biases
MISC--: previous research shown relation several measures information processing thinking style judgments
MISC--: example shiloh soltan sharabi citation reported systematic individual differences participants normative statistical vs heuristic responses
MISC--: normative statistical responses were found positively correlated rational thinking style negatively experiential thinking style
MISC--: smith levin citation identified need cognition moderator framing effects i e way information presented
MISC--: people who low need cognition were more affected framing effects
MISC--: shiloh koren zakay citation found compensatory decision making style need closure were correlated complexity representation decision task
MISC--: moreover individual differences information processing styles may work concert several contextual factors drive decision process
MISC--: example two factors according stanovich west citation performance errors reflect momentary fairly random lapses ancillary processes lack attention memory distortions alternative task construal where participants perceive interpret task way differs one implied normative point view experimenter s perspective
MISC--: thus way people process information dependent their individual processing style but also contextual factors change priority assigned different types attributes
MISC--: same vein kahneman frederick citation proposed attribute substitution processing information model explain variety biases
MISC--: according this model attempt simplify decision process individuals replace consideration complex attributes although might crucial choice at hand considerations simpler attributes may correlated more relevant ones
MISC--: implication this substitution process behavioral biases often result focusing irrelevant attributes ignoring crucial normative attributes
MISC--: example when individuals required assess risk level investment portfolio they often tend ignore crucial normative attributes data about real statistical correlation between funds rely instead irrelevant attributes comes more readily mind difference between funds names citation
MISC--: thus subtle manipulations contextual factors change priority given each attribute move judgmental process biased direction
OWNX--: based notions we argue individual information processing styles likely determine attributes contextual aspects will emphasized judgmental process ones will used substitutes
MISC--: regarding rational information processing style picture seems rather clear
MISC--: based previous research individuals who low rational thinking assumed more prone commit different types judgmental biases
MISC--: since people also more affected framing i e way information presented citation they more prone use alternative construal tasks
MISC--: consequently they expected show seemingly opposite behavioral biases when identical normative components set different situation
MISC--: however picture much less clear when we consider experiential thinking
MISC--: while biased behavior often considered result low tendency rational thinking high tendency experiential thinking replaces relevant attributes irrelevant attributes citation recent data suggest some situations highly intuitive thinking leads well adjusted judgments take into account different attributes according their importance rather quickly citation
MISC--: more recent studies may shed light interplay between rational experiential systems
MISC--: specifically highly rational participants tend engage active information search often leads selection more relevant attributes during decision process citation
MISC--: nevertheless experiential weighting integrating utilizes most relevant attributes via high rational thinking may bear added value lead less biased decisions individuals high experiential thinking citation
AIMX--: thus another goal current paper examine this proposed connection between experiential thinking judgment contrast more traditional account argues experiential thinking leads more biased judgments
