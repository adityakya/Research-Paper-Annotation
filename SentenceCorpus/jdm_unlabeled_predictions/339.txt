MISC--: less more effect lime occurs when recognition dependent agent greater probability choosing better item than more knowledgeable agent who recognizes more items
MISC--: goldstein gigerenzer citation define alpha probability correct choice made basis recognition alone beta probability correct choice made when both items recognized via additional cues
MISC--: they claim lime occurs if alpha greater than beta alpha greater than number number alpha beta remain constant number recognized items n varies
OWNX--: fact shown neither parameters generally remains constant n varies neither them simple functions n
OWNX--: therefore new theoretical basis lime needed
OWNX--: this paper provides mathematical results understanding when lime occur elucidates implications results
MISC--: major findings presented here follows demonstrations lime occur when alpha less than equal beta fail occur when alpha greater than beta derivation conditions co occurrences new characterization conditions under lime occurs generalizations this characterization handle imperfect recognition characterization when lime occurs more items become recognized
OWNX--: primary implication results advantage recognition cue depends not only cue validities but also order items learned
MISC--: this realization turn suggests research this area should incorporate more dynamic focus learning memory processes effects reputational information
MISC--: choosing between two items agent who recognizes one item but not other may use this recognition cue make choice whereas one who recognizes both items must use other cues one who recognizes neither must guess
MISC--: less more effect lime occurs when recognition dependent agent greater probability choosing better item than more knowledgeable agent who recognizes more items
AIMX--: this paper provides some new mathematical results understanding when lime occur elucidates implications results
MISC--: many researchers investigating descriptive validity recognition heuristic report high usage rates
MISC--: goldstein gigerenzer citation reported number percent usage rate
MISC--: serwe frings citation found number percent their lay number percent their amateur samples used recognition heuristic choosing tennis match winners
MISC--: newell shanks citation reported number percent usage stock market setting
MISC--: pachur biele citation found recognition heuristic accounted number percent forecasts their study more than four other candidate mechanisms
OWNX--: finally pohl citation observed additional cue knowledge increased usage recognition heuristic over cases where recognition object did not carry any other knowledge
CONT--: however empirical evidence lime equivocal at least face value
MISC--: goldstein gigerenzer citation serwe frings citation scheibehenne broder citation definitely yes camp pohl citation finds lime possible but claims only small effect sizes andersson edman ekman citation ayton onkal citation present less good more evidence pachur biele citation decidedly no camp
OWNX--: simulation studies based real ecologies lend some support prospect limes citation
MISC--: moreover schooler hertwig citation pleskac citation present simulation results suggesting imperfect recognition may actually increase likelihood lime
MISC--: matters further complicated shortcomings some studies apparent lack consensus requirements test lime
OWNX--: exigencies combined results presented this paper render corpus empirical studies problematic inconclusive
AIMX--: i shall return this matter toward end this paper
MISC--: goldstein gigerenzer citation define alpha probability correct choice made basis recognition alone beta probability correct choice made when both items recognized via additional cues
MISC--: they claim lime occurs if alpha greater than beta alpha greater than number number alpha beta remain constant number recognized items n varies
MISC--: this view been widely accepted used guide when expect lime citation
MISC--: pleskac citation concurs goldstein gigerenzer makes analogous claim under conditions imperfect recognition
MISC--: however goldstein gigerenzer assume alpha beta remain constant number recognized items n varies
OWNX--: fact neither parameters necessarily remains constant n varies neither them simple function n
OWNX--: we shall see demonstrations assertions shortly indeed goldstein gigerenzer allowed assumption not realistic
OWNX--: we shall see how various modifications this assumption lead absence presence lime
MISC--: sufficiently rigorous approach this problem begins distinguishing between probability beta correctly choosing between pairs recognized items using knowledge cue probability v correctly choosing between any pair items using knowledge cue i e v knowledge cue validity
MISC--: begin i will demonstrate lime occur when alpha less than beta
OWNX--: table number we number items number recognized
OWNX--: left most column shows rank each item outcome fifth cue rank column shows their ranks knowledge cue used choosing between two recognized items
OWNX--: purposes simplification clarity throughout this paper i will restrict discussion rank order knowledge cue no ties
MISC--: first let us determine alpha
MISC--: table number number correct choices sum number entries recog
MISC--: column whose ranks greater i e worse each number entries c number number number number number number number
MISC--: number incorrect choices sum number entries whose rank greater than each number entries d number number number number
MISC--: result alpha number number number number
OWNX--: we use similar procedure compute probability making correct choice using knowledge cue i e knowledge cue validity v
MISC--: c column table number shows number items ranked worse than item each row would correctly identified comparing item s cue rank other items
OWNX--: example first item cue rank number so using cue compare other number items we would correctly choose first item better ranked
OWNX--: contrast third item cue rank number so we would make only number correct choice comparing its cue rank those items actually ranked worse
MISC--: d column shows corresponding number incorrect choices
MISC--: there c number correct d number incorrect choices resulting cue validity v number number number number
MISC--: likewise last two columns table number probability choosing correctly between pairs recognized items using knowledge cue beta c c d number number number number
OWNX--: note v not equal beta
OWNX--: we example fact probability making correct choice between pairs number recognized items not same probability making correct choice when all number items recognized
MISC--: moreover both alpha beta vary depending order remaining items learned i e become recognizable
MISC--: example if next item learned item number number then result will beta number whereas if next item number number then result will beta number
MISC--: likewise if item number learned next alpha number whereas if item number learned next alpha number
OWNX--: examples show variation alpha beta n varies they demonstrate both parameters take different values alternative collections recognized items having same n
MISC--: moreover there no generalized relation between range possible values beta v
CONT--: assuming v greater than equal number number i e use any negative cue reverse there always at least one pair items whose rank order matches order cue so if only those two items been learned then beta number
MISC--: conversely if v less than number then there always at least one pair whose rank order cue order reversed so if only those two items been learned then beta number
MISC--: same argument alpha range number number depending order items learned
OWNX--: now we shall build up probability making correct choice between pairs items table number initially following goldstein gigerenzer
MISC--: those pairs where one item recognized other isn t we use recognition cue where n total number items n number recognized items
MISC--: probability correct choice when both items unrecognized i e where guess must made
MISC--: finally probability correct choice when both items recognized
MISC--: summing terms gives goldstein gigerenzer s citation formula
MISC--: they denote pcorrect fn so using their notation plugging appropriate numbers yields fn number
OWNX--: thus we lime because v number less than fn number but we also alpha number less than beta number so we observe if beta allowed vary thus differ v lime occur when alpha less than beta
MISC--: when alpha beta not constant not only lime occur when alpha less than beta but condition alpha greater than beta does not guarantee lime
MISC--: counter example constructed modifying one table number
CONT--: suppose knowledge cue ranks number objects number number number number number number number number number number
MISC--: then knowledge cue validity v number number number number
CONT--: now suppose number recognized objects outcome ranks number number number number number number
MISC--: then alpha number number number number beta number number number number alpha greater than beta satisfied
MISC--: however both alpha beta less than v so no weighted sum them number number going exceed v
MISC--: indeed fn number so lime does not occur
MISC--: i shall address issue how common occurrences lime when alpha less than beta no lime when alpha greater than beta sections follow
OWNX--: finally we need distinguish among various definitions lime
MISC--: goldstein gigerenzer point out there at least three versions one comparing more less knowledgeable agents another comparing performance different domains third comparing performance agent learns new items
OWNX--: version we been discussing first kind v less than fn katsikopoulos citation calls full experience lime
MISC--: but another fn greater than fn number occur regardless whether v less than fn
MISC--: let us call this local lime
MISC--: difference between two simply v fn
OWNX--: next section this paper investigates co occurrence lime alpha less than beta
OWNX--: third lays out conditions under lime occur under conditions perfect imperfect recognition
MISC--: fourth deals effect learning items there brief concluding section
OWNX--: all technical arguments theorems proofs relegated appendix
