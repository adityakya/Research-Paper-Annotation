MISC--: taxation policy driven many factors including public opinion but little research examined strength stability public s taxation preferences
OWNX--: this paper demonstrates one way preferences progressiveness depend framing question asked
MISC--: participants indicated how they would share fixed tax burden between two individuals who earned different amounts money either adjusting amount tax paid two individuals adjusting amount post tax income retained
MISC--: units tax was described amount money percentage tax rate were manipulated orthogonally
MISC--: there was strong metric effect participants favored progressiveness more when tax was described percentage rather than amount
MISC--: however there was also clear interaction amounts participants favored progressiveness significantly more when considering post tax money retained rather than tax paid percentages no effect was found
MISC--: progressiveness tax topical issue
MISC--: recently united states united kingdom there been move increase progressiveness taxation one u s president obama s campaign pledges was increase highest rate income tax just under number percent
MISC--: similarly united kingdom government recently announced will introduce new higher tax band number percent people earning over xa number number number number number year
MISC--: conversely several countries like russia ukraine baltic states recent years introduced versions flat taxes where all citizens pay same proportion their income no matter what its absolute value
MISC--: citation structuring income tax systems generally multiple often conflicting goals
OWNX--: most obvious goal raising revenue spend public services balancing potential extra revenue taken high tax rates disincentive work temptation illegally evade taxes high tax rates induce
MISC--: another key potential taxation distributional using example utilitarian egalitarian criteria redistribute wealth between rich poor citation
MISC--: although issue provokes strong opinions about optimal progressiveness tax regime one area often ignored extent public believe progressive taxation fair appropriate ways psychological mechanisms representing fairness affect tax progressiveness preferences
OWNX--: existing data give mixed picture
MISC--: generally when asked whether those higher incomes should pay higher marginal rate tax people agree citation
MISC--: however people s progressiveness preferences appear depend way questions posed
MISC--: example roberts hite bradley citation found when participants were asked abstract questions about progressiveness form progressive tax rates more less fair than flat tax rates students some tax education indicated strongly progressive taxation was more fair line other studies
MISC--: however when asked concrete questions how much more tax somebody earning number number should pay relative somebody earning number number same participants indicated preference flat taxes this case dominant response being former should pay double
MISC--: other hand edlund citation showed swedish taxpayers favored progressiveness both abstract concrete questions finding he attributed swedes better awareness welfare state other provisions paid taxation
MISC--: similarly lewis citation found participants who gave preferences taxation at different incomes favored progressiveness
MISC--: this inconsistency perhaps not surprising given large body work shows preferences often unstable way options framed affect people s preferences large number areas citation
MISC--: framing effects been specifically found tax preferences citation
MISC--: example mccaffery baron citation demonstrated several framing effects participants who chose tax regimes different family situations
MISC--: among other things they found participants indicated regimes taxation system was described terms tax bonuses certain groups rather than tax penalties other groups were fairer even though situations were numerically identical
MISC--: they also found what they called metric effect participants favored more progressive taxation when taxation levels were described percentages gross income rather than absolute number dollars
OWNX--: finally they found modest status quo effect participants were drawn towards initial taxation structure
MISC--: one intriguing finding roberts et al citation was participants were less inconsistent between abstract concrete questions when concrete questions were framed terms amount money left after tax rather than amount tax paid
OWNX--: furthermore authors note passing their pattern results indicates changing reference point taxes residual income produced shift away regressive taxes toward flat progressive taxes p number although assertion was not tested statistically
OWNX--: this framing effect deserves further investigation at least two reasons
MISC--: first although asking people about amount tax should paid people different incomes seems most direct way assess preferences asking people about money left after tax may more grounded people s experience paying tax hence greater stability validity likely people more able report how much money they take home after tax not least because amount appears their bank statements than amount money they pay tax given month
MISC--: second psychological wellbeing appears associated relative absolute amount consumption person able do crudely amount money they left after tax other unavoidable drains resources met citation
MISC--: this suggests attempts determine people s preferences taxation should use frame residual income foregrounded
MISC--: experiment reported here examines effects two variables completely between subjects factorial design effect tax paid versus money left framing effect describing tax percentages amounts metric effect investigated mccaffery baron citation interactions between two variables
MISC--: surface features task similar those used roberts et al citation using two taxpayers who different gross incomes
MISC--: however response method different
MISC--: roberts et al s paper people were asked about ratios taxes form if andy earns number k bob earns number k how much more tax should andy pay than bob
MISC--: then marking scale labels same amount twice much so may bias people towards responding heuristically twice much most available justifiable ratio
