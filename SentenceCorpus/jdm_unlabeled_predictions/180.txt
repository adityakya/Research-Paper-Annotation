MISC--: mathematics fundamental tool research
MISC--: although potentially applicable every discipline amount training mathematics students typically receive varies greatly between different disciplines
MISC--: those disciplines where most researchers do not master mathematics use mathematics may held too much awe
OWNX--: demonstrate this i conducted online experiment number participants all had experience reading research reports postgraduate degree any subject
MISC--: participants were presented abstracts two published papers one evolutionary anthropology one sociology
OWNX--: based abstracts participants were asked judge quality research
OWNX--: either one other two abstracts was manipulated through inclusion extra sentence taken completely unrelated paper presenting equation made no sense context
MISC--: abstract included meaningless mathematics tended judged higher quality
OWNX--: however this nonsense math effect was not found among participants degrees mathematics science technology medicine
AIMX--: background this paper my own subjective experience mid career move pure mathematics interdisciplinary work social science cultural studies
AIMX--: areas like sociology evolutionary anthropology i found mathematics often used ways my viewpoint were illegitimate make point would better made only simple logic uncritically take properties mathematical model properties real world include mathematics make paper look more impressive
CONT--: those areas social sciences humanities broadly recognized mathematics valuable tool mathematical skills may still generally too low optimal use this tool
CONT--: there may lack understanding what mathematics should used what cannot should not used
OWNX--: if mathematics held awe unhealthy way its use not subjected sufficient levels critical thinking
MISC--: within field pure mathematics academic writing expected completely transparent anyone knowledgeable about mathematical concepts involved
OWNX--: typical reviewer pure mathematics paper will not tolerate sentence paragraph meaning obscure
MISC--: same cannot said about some other academic disciplines
MISC--: mathematical physicist alan sokal famously composed paper was deliberately obscure nonsensical he submitted journal social text where editors accepted publication citation
MISC--: this so called sokal hoax demonstrated there experienced readers research publications who will not necessarily react adversely fact text cannot really made sense
MISC--: indeed sokal bricmont citation documented book following up hoax obscurity hallmark certain academic traditions associated terms like postmodernism relativism
OWNX--: however science bashing genres were not responsible abuse mathematics i referred above contrary i found mathematics poorly used fields where tools science held uncritically high regard
MISC--: acceptance admiration writing actually does not make much sense may found both camps
MISC--: course my personal impressions may biased
CONT--: perhaps there no widespread acceptance admiration obscure nonsensical use mathematics social sciences humanities if there perhaps just widespread areas like technology natural sciences where everyone learns how use mathematics
MISC--: order obtain some hard evidence i conducted experiment
MISC--: brief i recruited participants research experience varying disciplines
MISC--: participants were presented two abstracts published papers good journals asked judge quality research presented abstracts
OWNX--: one two abstracts randomly chosen was manipulated addition extra sentence
OWNX--: this sentence was taken completely unrelated paper presented equation made no sense context
