MISC--: hierarchical bayesian methods offer principled comprehensive way relate psychological models data
BASE--: here we use them model patterns information search stopping deciding simulated binary comparison judgment task
OWNX--: simulation involves number subjects making number forced choice comparisons about relative magnitudes two objects two german cities more inhabitants
AIMX--: two worked examples show how hierarchical models developed account explain diversity both search stopping rules seen across simulated individuals
MISC--: we discuss how results provide insight into current debates literature heuristic decision making argue they demonstrate power flexibility hierarchical bayesian methods modeling human decision making
MISC--: cognitive scientist individual differences behavior both intriguing annoying
OWNX--: we all familiar subjects our experiments who don t do what they supposed do
MISC--: sometimes different patterns behavior simply noise subject was cell phone during experiment but often they due legitimate responses our theories models failed anticipate cannot explain
MISC--: field judgment decision making no exception challenge individual differences
MISC--: brighton gigerenzer citation mention passing even theory important influential prospect theory citation typically predicts only number percent number percent decisions two alternative choice tasks many models do much worse
AIMX--: how should we field treat individual differences challenges they present our models theories
CONT--: one emerging approach tackling issues use hierarchical bayesian methods extend existing models apply them principled ways experimental observational data citation
CONT--: this approach not only provide tools interpreting individual differences but also facilitates theory building providing model based account why individual differences might arise
OWNX--: we think especially interesting important promising approach because deals fully developed models cognition without constraints theoretical assumptions used develop models
MISC--: taking existing successful models cognition embedding them within hierarchical bayesian framework opens vista potential extensions improvements current modeling because provides capability model rich structure cognition complicated settings
OWNX--: demonstrate application hierarchical bayesian methods modeling heuristic decision making we use standard experimental setup requires subjects make judgments about relative magnitudes two objects size distance fame profitability so
MISC--: perform judgments often assumed subjects search their memory external sources information cues help differentiate objects
MISC--: example inference about relative size two cities might facilitated cues indicating two cities capital airport university so citation
CONT--: judgments then determined rules use presence absence cues provide estimates desired criterion i e number inhabitants
MISC--: tasks although apparently simple incorporate several important features need specification theories models wish describe how subjects perform them
AIMX--: this paper we present two simple case studies first focuses information search second focuses stopping rules
