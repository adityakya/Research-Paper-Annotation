MISC--: runs gains losses particularly salient decision makers because their perceived departure randomness well their immediate impact financial status decision makers
MISC--: past research focused decision making biases relate faulty conceptions chance luck gambler s fallacy hot hand effect
MISC--: participants current study bet outcomes long sequence simulated coin tosses
MISC--: risk preferences were found change function run valence i e losses vs gains run length financial status
MISC--: individuals were found differ effect all factors their responses runs gains losses sequential risky choice
MISC--: many decisions repeated over time accordingly results past decisions substantial impact future decisions
OWNX--: financial analysts make repeated decisions involving gains losses charting financial data common method used summarize past performance companies markets
MISC--: runs consecutive gains losses frequently depicted charts generally some their more noticeable characteristics
MISC--: behavioral finance researchers believe run patterns so prominent runs affect future predictions made analysts
MISC--: this influence troubling because runs highlighted shefrin s quote often occur naturally without any special underlying cause
MISC--: shefrin citation emphasized folly basing financial predictions solely run patterns he provided case studies financial experts illustrate poor decisions
MISC--: one example involved prediction number senior investment adviser merrill lynch
OWNX--: after exceptionally long period high returns equities analyst incorrectly forecast below average returns were inevitable after long run gains
MISC--: unfortunately analyst there was number number percent increase dow jones index close trading year
MISC--: this analyst committed classic gambler s fallacy believing long runs outcomes low frequency occurrence therefore runs more likely end longer they continue
OWNX--: but we assume any investors who decreased their investment equities at this time were doing so because gambler s fallacy
MISC--: there no doubt humans susceptible biased probabilistic reasoning when judging predicting runs random near random binary events citation
MISC--: but runs losses gains not like other binary events because consequences events also financial impact decision maker
MISC--: run losses will result depletion financial resources just run gains will result increase financial resources
MISC--: but most real world laboratory based studies impact runs gains losses risk preferences focused solely biased reasoning explanations disregarded explanations based financial impacts runs
MISC--: example sundali croson citation examined prevalence gambler s fallacy hot hand gamblers playing roulette casino
MISC--: hot hand another decision bias result betting random events
MISC--: decision makers who follow hot hand heuristic behave if runs gains losses likely continue possibly because winning creates illusion control
MISC--: result decision makers risk more after run gains risk less after run losses
MISC--: sundali croson citation tested hot hand effect looking at number bets gamblers made after win after loss
MISC--: researchers assumed hot hand bias would cause gamblers make more bets after win than after loss they found many gamblers who produced betting behaviors
MISC--: however researchers also admitted same pattern risk preferences could result concurrent changes financial state occur during runs gains losses
MISC--: they suggested gamblers could also place more bets after win because they feel richer
CONT--: however sundali croson citation had no way recording financial status gamblers their study
MISC--: laboratory studies allow researcher examine how runs gains losses influence risk preferences whilst controlling financial status decision maker
MISC--: most previous studies gains losses laboratory settings not implemented control
MISC--: example johnson tellis macinnis citation examined effects runs losses gains single simulated investment decision
MISC--: investment decision was based stock reports highlighted run gains losses immediately prior this investment decision
MISC--: length run was manipulated researchers
MISC--: majority participants varied their choice basis prior runs researchers explained choices terms hot hand gambler s fallacy
MISC--: although this research important implications one off investment decisions experimental design fails capture dynamic nature sequential risky choice
OWNX--: prior run gains losses had no direct effect financial status participants subsequently no effect choices made participants
OWNX--: not surprisingly reasons provided participants this experiment appeared indicate biased probabilistic reasoning
MISC--: one laboratory study did attempt capture dynamic more complex aspects sequential risky choices was conducted leopard citation
OWNX--: this study participants were provided long sequence binary gambles where riskiness gambles was manipulated changing variance amount lost gained
MISC--: although this experimental manipulation does not change actual risk gamble i e expected value remains same each choice previous research shown participants perceive gambles larger variance riskier choices
MISC--: example winning losing number number perceived riskier than winning losing number number
MISC--: leopard allowed runs gains losses occur naturally during long sequences random events participants were requested play until they had lost their starting bank number number until they had played number gambles
MISC--: leopard recorded run valence loss vs gain run length before each choice was made also recorded current bank participant each time gamble was played
MISC--: leopard tested run effects conducting kruskal wallis non parametric equivalent anova analysis gamble risk each run length
OWNX--: runs losses were coded negative run value runs gains were coded positive run value
OWNX--: significant run effect was found number percent her participants each participant s data summarized figure number
OWNX--: leopard then grouped participants basis visual inspection graphs displayed figure number
OWNX--: she inferred eight participants had followed gambler s fallacy figure number three participants had shown hot hand effect figure number b
MISC--: she also found two participants who provided non linear risk preferences she labeled participants incurable optimists figure number c
MISC--: she believed participants increased their risk because they perceived long runs any type signal positive outcome imminent
MISC--: leopard s conclusions raise several questions
MISC--: leopard admitted outcome financial state inherently confounded some degree at least some subjects p number
OWNX--: many participants leopard s study provided significant relationships between risk preference financial state including all but three participants displayed figure number
OWNX--: addition her classification participants relied solely visual inspection data graphed figure number
MISC--: however unclear whether linear non linear patterns required classifications were actually statistically significant
MISC--: addition consistent trends were not always evident both types runs gains losses across full range run lengths
MISC--: many participants figures number number b showed stronger non linear trends run length increased run valence changed
MISC--: non linear trends could reflect change risk strategy during times
MISC--: finally outcomes each participant s gambles were random therefore participant s financial state at times when runs occurred could varied dramatically within between participants
CONT--: leopard does not provide any information about how many participants failed complete number trials what financial state each participant was at end each experimental session
CONT--: not out question participant may experienced runs only when down their initial bank alternatively experienced runs only when up their initial bank
MISC--: difficulty using random event sequences there no control over when runs will occur what type run will occur how long each run will
AIMX--: goal current study improve leopard citation study controlling type runs length runs when runs occur respect participant s financial state
MISC--: more thorough statistical analysis data collected will also provide better justification speculated causes risk preference patterns during runs gains losses
MISC--: i hypothesize financial status will affect risk preferences but runs gains losses will still influence risk preferences independently effects status
MISC--: latter hypothesis based evidence decision makers highly predisposed faulty probabilistic reasoning involving repeated random binary events citation
MISC--: consequently linear patterns risk preferences follow gambler s fallacy negative slope hot hand positive slope still expected
MISC--: however other participants may show significant non linear relationships between run variables risk preference there two possible explanations non linear patterns
MISC--: prior research found perceptions runs may not linearly related length
MISC--: carlson schu citation recently reported incremental reaction sequence repeated outcomes often peaks at three consecutive outcomes plateaus after this third event
MISC--: second explanation non linear effects participant follows different strategies runs different lengths valence
MISC--: example self perception being lucky winner after couple wins row will compete growing misperception this streak must end if continues grow
MISC--: eventually latter perception may win out change risk preference occurs leading non linear pattern risk preferences
MISC--: i hypothesize use risk strategies during runs gains losses much more dynamic transient than suggested previous research
