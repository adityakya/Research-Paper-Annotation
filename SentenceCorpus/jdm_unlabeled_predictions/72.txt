AIMX--: this paper investigates boundaries recent result eliciting more than one estimate same person averaging lead accuracy gains judgment tasks
MISC--: first examines its generality analysing whether kind question being asked effect size potential gains
MISC--: experimental results show question type matters
MISC--: previous results reporting potential accuracy gains reproduced year estimation questions extended questions about percentage shares
MISC--: other hand no gains found general numerical questions
AIMX--: second part paper tests repeated judgment sampling s practical applicability asking judges provide third final answer basis their first two estimates
OWNX--: experiment majority judges do not consistently average their first two answers
MISC--: result they do not realise potential accuracy gains averaging
OWNX--: imagine you been asked make quantitative judgment say somebody wants know when shakespeare s romeo juliet was first performed you might planning holiday alps wondering about elevation mont blanc
MISC--: effective strategy answer questions make estimate average second judge friend colleague just about anybody else citation
MISC--: what though if your colleague friend unavailable cannot give you second opinion
MISC--: recent research suggests you could improve your answer bringing yourself make second estimate applying averaging principle your own two estimates citation
OWNX--: effectiveness this suggestion however will depend both degree you able elicit two independent estimates yourself your willingness average them
OWNX--: previous research focused method used elicit second estimate
MISC--: focus here lies type question being asked its interaction how successive estimates generated
MISC--: i report experimental results different sets questions aim more representative quantitative judgments citation
OWNX--: i first reproduce previous results establish existence accuracy gains year estimation questions what year were bacteria discovered
MISC--: citation
MISC--: while i find similar gains questions about percentage shares e g percentage spanish homes access internet
MISC--: i do not find evidence accuracy gains general numerical questions what distance kilometers between barcelona city hamburg germany
OWNX--: what average depth mediterranean sea
MISC--: 
OWNX--: i then investigate whether this difference explained degree answers various question types implicitly bounded but this hypothesis not supported data
MISC--: second factor whether judges actually recognise potential gains averaging behave accordingly
MISC--: larrick soll citation argue people often do not understand properties benefits averaging procedures
CONT--: my experimental data provide further evidence only small minority judges consistently average their estimates
OWNX--: often judges settle one their first two judgments final answer instead even extrapolate providing final answer lies outside range spanned their first two estimates
