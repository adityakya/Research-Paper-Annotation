MISC--: recognition heuristic citation makes counter intuitive prediction decision maker utilizing less information may do well outperform idealized decision maker utilizing more information
OWNX--: we lay theoretical foundation use single variable heuristics recognition heuristic optimal decision strategy within linear modeling framework
OWNX--: we identify conditions under over weighting single predictor mini max strategy among class priori chosen weights based decision heuristics respect measure statistical lack fit we call risk
OWNX--: strategies turn outperform standard multiple regression long amount data available limited
OWNX--: we also show under related conditions weighting only one variable ignoring all others produces same risk ignoring single variable weighting all others
MISC--: this approach advantage generalizing beyond original environment recognition heuristic situations more than two choice options binary continuous representations recognition other single variable heuristics
OWNX--: we analyze structure data used some prior recognition tasks find matches sufficient conditions optimality our results
MISC--: rather than being poor adequate substitute compensatory model recognition heuristic closely approximates optimal strategy when decision maker finite data about world
MISC--: common sense would suggest always better more rather than less relevant information when making decision
MISC--: most normative prescriptive theories multi attribute decision making compensatory models incorporate all relevant variables
MISC--: this perspective was challenged gigerenzer goldstein citation gigerenzer todd abc group citation who proposed theoretical framework simple decision rules often referred fast frugal heuristics suggesting some cases decision maker dm utilizing less relevant information may actually outperform idealized dm utilizing all relevant information
MISC--: fact many heuristics use single cue selected among many available prediction task
MISC--: key among single variable decision rules recognition heuristic rh citation
MISC--: rapidly growing empirical literature suggests single variable decision rules descriptive at least subset dms regard both take best citation rh citation
MISC--: questions remain however exactly when why single variable rule will perform well
MISC--: hogarth karelaia citation examined relative performance single variable rules within binary choice framework where both predictor independent criterion dependent variable were assumed continuous
MISC--: using combination analytic tools simulations they found single variable rules strong predictive accuracy when number all predictors highly positively inter correlated number single predictor used highly typically positively correlated criterion
MISC--: hogarth karelaia citation conducted related analysis using binary rather than continuous cues predictors
MISC--: fasolo mcclelland todd citation identified similar favorable conditions single variable rules using series simulations
MISC--: shanteau thomas citation labeled environments highly positively correlated predictors friendly environments demonstrated simulation single variable rules tended underperform when predictors model were negatively correlated finding was later replicated fasolo et al citation citation
MISC--: similar vein baucells carrasco hogarth citation presented framework analyze simple decision rules within context cumulative dominance citation
AIMX--: this paper we present results regarding effectiveness single variable rules diverge previous studies two major ways
MISC--: first we show when single predictor denoted without any loss generality x positively correlated array p many other predictors where each p many predictors either uncorrelated weakly positively correlated optimal weighting scheme places greater weight x than any remaining cues
MISC--: this result major departure previous studies citation identify favorable conditions single variable rules single factor models where all variables highly positively correlated
MISC--: second our results do not rely any specific assumptions about cue validities defined correlations between predictors cues criterion
MISC--: only thing matters sign correlation single cue
MISC--: some lexicographic single variable rules depend upon either knowledge estimation all cue validities
MISC--: example take best rule citation depends identification single best cue
OWNX--: our results validity single variable need not highest among available predictors
OWNX--: we apply new results rh goldstein gigerenzer citation argue recognition validity i e correlation between criterion recognition inaccessible dm criterion variable influencing recognition through mediator variables environment
OWNX--: divergence our results stems our somewhat different approach answering question when does less information lead better performance
OWNX--: first we characterize rh within framework linear model i e within standard regression framework estimator relies single predictor
OWNX--: regression framework we conceptualize best set weights assign cues if one had unlimited data knowledge they would maximize predictive accuracy call this vector weights beta
OWNX--: we then consider weights would placed cues various decision heuristics equal weighting if they were estimates beta
OWNX--: within this framework we prove results respect measure statistical inaccuracy called risk defined formally section number measures how close heuristic weights expected best weights beta
MISC--: this measure inaccuracy particularly useful because goes beyond optimizing within single sample closer set weights best weights more robustly cross validate new samples
MISC--: advantage casting problem within framework linear model results generalized accommodate broad range situations including choosing between more than two options binary continuous representations recognition evaluate success any single variable rule not just rh
OWNX--: we show under certain conditions placing greater weight single variable relative all others represents form optimization minimizes maximum value risk over all choices decision rules
MISC--: number cues becomes large this mini max strategy converges rule puts large weight single cue minimally weights all others
OWNX--: we use term over weighting describe this effect single predictor cue receiving disproportionally more weight than any other predictor cue according optimal weighting strategy
OWNX--: further we show weighting single cue ignoring all others produces same risk ignoring single cue weighting all others regardless number cues
MISC--: previous research shown decision heuristics applied this manner outperform standard regression models until samples become very large citation
OWNX--: thus we expect under right conditions single variable just accurate predictor full set predictors
OWNX--: while this framework could used justify any single variable heuristic we argue sufficient conditions plausibly resemble environments one would use rh where recognition single cue
OWNX--: indeed we examine data used prior recognition tasks citation show fits well our sufficient conditions
MISC--: our derivation does not assume cue selection process
OWNX--: other words we presuppose dm always utilizes single cue interest
MISC--: rh theory natural application results this theory also does not presuppose cue selection process i e if one alternative recognized other not then recognition automatically predictor cue interest
MISC--: why recognition rational
OWNX--: our results demonstrate when single cue recognition positively correlated all other cues knowledge then mini max strategy over weight recognition cue
MISC--: interestingly results do not depend upon validities either recognition knowledge cues
AIMX--: this paper represents convergence two perspectives
OWNX--: one hand we validate ecological rationality single variable rules recasting them robust statistical estimators minimize maximal risk within linear model
MISC--: another perspective our results suggest heuristics could work no other reason than they approximate optimal statistical model albeit objective function heretofore been unarticulated this literature
MISC--: thus while goldstein gigerenzer citation see rh approach contrast heuristics being used imperfect versions optimal statistical procedures appears laplacean demon citation unlimited computational power would use rule much like rh
AIMX--: remainder paper organized follows
OWNX--: first we summarize recent advances evaluation decision heuristics within linear model make some simplifying assumptions
OWNX--: we then describe sufficient conditions single variable over weighting phenomenon first considering case single variable correlated array weakly positively inter correlated predictors followed more extreme case set mutually uncorrelated predictors within this array
OWNX--: we then present application this theory rh prove under conditions dm utilizing only recognition will perform at least well dm utilizing only knowledge
OWNX--: we then examine inter correlation matrix empirical study finding preliminary support descriptive accuracy sufficient conditions
