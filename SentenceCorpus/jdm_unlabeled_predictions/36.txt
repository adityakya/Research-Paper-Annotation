MISC--: previous research identified important determinants overall evaluations experiences lived across time
MISC--: means novel guessing task i study what decision makers themselves consider important
MISC--: informants some participants live evaluate experience
MISC--: guessers others infer its overall evaluation asking informants questions
OWNX--: i rewarded accurate inferences analyzed classified questions four experiments involving auditory gustatory viewing experiences
OWNX--: results show guessers thought overall evaluations reflecting average momentary impressions
MISC--: moreover alternatively they tended consider personality attitudes experiencing person experience specific holistic judgments behavioral intentions regarding experience
MISC--: thus according lay intuitions overall evaluations more than reflection experience s momentary impressions
MISC--: people often report experiences expressing number scale
CONT--: someone might say number out number this concert terms painfulness i rate this medical procedure number out number
MISC--: overall evaluations experiences been shown important decision inputs citation studied extensively
MISC--: kahneman wakker sarin citation suggested experiences represented intensity profiles pleasure discomfort over bounded intervals time i e time profiles experienced utility
MISC--: experiments field studies shown people evaluate more positively experiences increasing rather than decreasing time profiles at equivalent levels total pleasure experienced citation
MISC--: there preference steeper rates improvement citation well variability experience citation
MISC--: finally peak end rule finding suggests overall evaluations best predicted only two moments experience most pleasant unpleasant final citation
MISC--: kahneman wakker sarin citation present set assumptions about experiences explaining why integration summation all moments would correct normative point view
MISC--: life satisfaction researchers psychologists other hand explore alternative paradigms study role personality beliefs evaluating person overall evaluations citation
MISC--: contrast previous research present work aims reveal what decision makers themselves draw they think about overall evaluations experiences
MISC--: i will compare lay intuitions what researchers considered
CONT--: this comparison may further enrich theories overall evaluations suggest ways testing them
OWNX--: i employ novel method guessing task order elicit lay intuitions
MISC--: philosophy method active information search method naturalistic decision making huber wider huber citation proposed study risky choice
MISC--: method consists giving participants minimal description decision problem allowing them seek information
OWNX--: i report experiments participants had guess overall evaluation experience lived another person
MISC--: active information search was allowed prior making guess
OWNX--: information participants sought was taken reveal lay intuitions about target overall evaluation
