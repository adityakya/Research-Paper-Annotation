MISC--: oppenheimer monin citation recently found subjectively rare events taken indicate longer preceding sequence unobserved trials than subjectively common events effect they refer retrospective gambler s fallacy
AIMX--: current paper extends this idea situation where participants judge likelihood streak continuation
OWNX--: participants were told about streak produced random process coin flips human performance basketball shots either predicted next outcome inferred immediately preceding outcome
OWNX--: coin scenarios participants tended expect streak termination gambler s fallacy this effect was same predictions retrospective inferences
OWNX--: basketball scenarios no overall bias was found either prospective retrospective judgments
OWNX--: results support oppenheimer monin s suggestion reconstruction past entails same heuristics prediction future they also support idea nature data generating process key determinant whether people fall into gambler s fallacy
OWNX--: suggested term retrospective gambler s fallacy used describe situations where streak taken indicate preceding unobserved outcome was opposite type phenomenon discovered oppenheimer monin referred retrospective representativeness retrospective belief law small numbers
MISC--: recent article this journal oppenheimer monin citation raised possibility people s judgments about past history random process might display same biases their predictions future outcomes
MISC--: oppenheimer monin focussed gambler s fallacy belief streak one outcome raises probability other outcome above base rate citation
MISC--: most common explanation gambler s fallacy people employ representativeness heuristic they believe law small numbers citation small samples should representative underlying probabilities run one outcome needs balanced out occurrence opposite outcome
MISC--: oppenheimer monin citation suggested gambler s fallacy might also operate when people reconstruct past history random process
MISC--: rather than having participants predict future outcomes they asked people estimate number trials had preceded occurrence particular event
OWNX--: example participants were asked imagine walking into room find man flipping coin five times either producing streak five heads mix three heads two tails
OWNX--: participants were then asked how many times man had flipped coin before they entered room
MISC--: estimates participants streak condition were much larger than those participants non streak condition
MISC--: this result generalizes across wide variety domains oppenheimer monin found estimated number previous trials was greater when outcome was subjectively unlikely effect they refer retrospective gambler s fallacy
OWNX--: this effect important because suggests heuristics biases shape our predictions future also colour our reconstruction past citation
MISC--: however notable focus oppenheimer monin s citation work not gambler s fallacy traditionally conceived
MISC--: rather than examining judgments about outcomes previous trials manner analogous prediction future outcomes authors focussed estimates number preceding trials
MISC--: oppenheimer monin note most straightforward instantiation retrospective gambler s fallacy would formally identical gambler s fallacy only past
MISC--: 
MISC--: 
OWNX--: while this would natural extension gambler s fallacy our knowledge never been tested p number
MISC--: current experiment supplements oppenhemier monin s citation work providing test
OWNX--: participants were told about streak one outcome asked either predict next outcome infer outcome trial before streak
MISC--: additional manipulation data generating process was varied some participants was physical process likely regarded random coin flipping whilst others was skill based action basketball shooting
MISC--: motivation this was although gambler s fallacy widespread some judgment domains produce opposite bias belief streak one outcome increases probability outcome citation
