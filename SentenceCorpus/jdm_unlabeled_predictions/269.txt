MISC--: sunk cost fallacy tendency continue endeavour once investment money effort time been made
OWNX--: we studied how people s chronic orientation cope failing projects i e action vs state orientation influences occurrence this sunk cost effect
OWNX--: we found people state orientation who tendency ruminate about past events hard time let go them were especially prone fall sunk cost trap
MISC--: people action orientation who more easily let go past events were not susceptible sunk cost effect
OWNX--: we discuss implications results sunk cost fallacy literature
OWNX--: makes no sense eat dessert you dislike pay stock broker knowing money will lost right
MISC--: yet many people do exactly this they make investments will vain prevent wasting earlier investments
MISC--: having paid dessert people thus feel they should finish even though dessert not their liking would waste pay not eat
MISC--: similar vein people may reluctant sell their losing stocks because selling they would acknowledge their prior investments were wasted
MISC--: this tendency honor prior costs holding failing projects called sunk cost fallacy citation
MISC--: more general terms sunk cost fallacy describes tendency continue endeavour once investment money effort time been made citation
MISC--: people regularly use sunk costs justify further investments many decisions ranging decision eat dessert one already paid citation decision continue research development already outperformed products citation
MISC--: this effect not restricted consumer behavior economic decision making but extends many other decisions including policy making
MISC--: instance one important reasons continue war iraq was prevent acknowledging soldiers who fell battle died vain
MISC--: sunk cost fallacy thus influences many decisions very mundane highly exceptional affects all sorts people ranging customers restaurants most important influential leaders
MISC--: above clear people likely become victims sunk cost fallacy
MISC--: however one could wonder whether all people equally likely fall prey this effect
MISC--: some people seem dwell more past than others
MISC--: differences coping been demonstrated extensive research state versus action orientation
MISC--: action oriented people typically get over negative events quickly focus taking action solve them while state oriented people typically find difficult overcome negative event keep ruminating about how affects their current state citation
MISC--: this distinction seems highly relevant question whether people differ their susceptibility sunk cost fallacy
MISC--: although prior investments like paying dessert buying stocks may not seen negative events they may become negative if they not compensated current future outcomes i e if dessert tastes horrible stocks lose their value
MISC--: question then becomes how state action oriented people respond those prospects how much they let their decisions affected prior investments
MISC--: our proposition state oriented people more affected prior investments
MISC--: we argue more state oriented people more prone they see current decisions light previous investments thereby strengthening association between two events
MISC--: more action oriented people more likely they focus future what they achieve thereby weakening association between current decisions previous investments
MISC--: indirect support this reasoning comes research showing more action oriented people more they decouple missed opportunities past related decisions they currently face citation
AIMX--: respect sunk cost fallacy we expect compared action oriented people state oriented people more influenced previous investments when deciding about current investment hence they more likely show sunk cost fallacy
MISC--: predictions particularly interesting relation prior reasoning action orientation literature
MISC--: there assumption often made action oriented mindset increases likelihood finishing project citation
MISC--: moreover argued against nature action oriented people quit already started project citation
OWNX--: at first sight present hypothesis seems at odds this reasoning predicts precisely opposite
MISC--: however we argue line earlier studies sense action oriented people expected more decisive than state oriented people they urge take action solve failing situation
MISC--: thus case sunk costs applying this reasoning leads counterintuitive prediction more action oriented people more likely they quit project they started investing
MISC--: put differently we expect state oriented people more likely continue investing than action oriented people
MISC--: order examine this we presented participants standard sunk cost decision scenario citation presence absence sunk cost was manipulated
OWNX--: we related participants answers their scores chronic action orientation measure was assessed at earlier occasion
MISC--: we expected find stronger sunk cost effects state oriented people than action oriented people
