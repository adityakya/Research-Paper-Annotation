MISC--: this article broad perspective incorporating elements time series theory presented conceptualizing data obtained multi trial judgment experiments
OWNX--: recent evidence suggests sequential context effects assimilation contrast commonly found psychophysical judgment tasks may present judgments abstract magnitudes
MISC--: time series approach analyzing single subject data developed applied expert prognostic judgments risk heart disease emphasis detecting possible sequential context effects
OWNX--: results demonstrate sequential context effects do exist expert prognostic judgments
OWNX--: contrast assimilation were produced cue series latter occurring more frequently
OWNX--: experts also showed assimilation prior responses was independent cue series input
MISC--: time series analysis also revealed abrupt large trial trial changes value cues receive most attention prognostic judgment tasks disrupt accuracy judgments
MISC--: findings suggest time series approach useful alternative ordinary least squares regression providing additional insights into cognitive processes operating during multi cue judgment experiments
MISC--: many judgment experiments may viewed involving two time series series stimuli presented experimenter series responses provided subject
MISC--: over years various theories human judgment been proposed
MISC--: one thing all theories common they been being developed using single subject repeated measures experiments
MISC--: whether judgment data modeled using multiple regression typical judgment analysis paradigm often associated social judgment theory citation single subject anova forms foundation information integration theory citation conjoint analysis citation fast frugal heuristics take best citation matching heuristic citation data obtained presenting subject series stimuli judged recording series responses
MISC--: idiographic designs analysis their ensuant data focus this article
OWNX--: contrast assimilation psychological processes involving sequential context judgments made
MISC--: variety psychophysical judgment paradigms employing large numbers trials e g absolute relative magnitude scaling tasks absolute relative identification tasks sequential context effects frequently observed citation
MISC--: assimilation occurs when response given stimulus intensity tends larger when immediately preceding stimulus greater intensity than current stimulus tends smaller when preceding stimulus intensity less than current stimulus
MISC--: contrast occurs when response given stimulus intensity tends smaller when immediately preceding stimulus greater intensity than current stimulus tends larger when preceding stimulus intensity less than current stimulus
CONT--: decarlo cross citation discuss various theoretical models psychophysical judgment been proposed explain sequential context effects magnitude scaling experiments show how evaluated using time series regression
MISC--: one class models referred relative judgment models subject portrayed comparing value current stimulus value stimulus preceding trial rather than some fixed internal reference
MISC--: stewart et al citation discuss relative judgment models absolute identification tasks
MISC--: another class models suggests sequential context effects result response heuristic tendency subject face uncertainty guess direction his her previous response citation
MISC--: point consideration sequential context effects may arise because internal representation current stimulus affected previous stimulus because tendency under uncertainty provide response based previous response
MISC--: question whether similar sequential context effects operate expert judgment tasks
MISC--: expert prognostic judgments clinician s estimate likelihood patient will suffer heart attack future based current signs symptoms been studied judgment researchers employing multiple regression analysis citation
MISC--: illustrate how sequential context effects might manifest themselves let us examine what could happen single dichotomous cue
MISC--: example consider clinician faced prognostic task estimating patient s risk coronary heart disease chd say cue question whether not patient diabetes
MISC--: situation described assimilation if judgment chd risk patient diabetes tends lower when immediately preceding patient does not diabetes judgment chd risk patient without diabetes tends higher when preceding patient diabetes
MISC--: alternatively situation described contrast if judgment chd risk patient diabetes tends higher when immediately preceding patient does not diabetes judgment chd risk patient without diabetes tends lower when preceding patient diabetes
MISC--: psychophysical judgment tasks magnitude scaling observed response provided subject interpreted estimate sensory magnitude associated given unidimensional stimulus intensity
MISC--: multi cue judgment tasks where there not necessarily objective stimulus intensity scaled response provided subject may interpreted differently
MISC--: judgment tasks observed response may interpreted estimate integrated judgment along more abstract subjective continuum patient risk chd
MISC--: vlaev chater citation asked whether contrast assimilation observed psychophysical judgments would operate when people make estimates more abstract magnitudes
MISC--: they examined estimates cooperativeness made series strategic choice decisions i e prisoner s dilemma games
CONT--: their experiment playing random sequence number cooperative uncooperative games produced greater mean differences cooperation rates number percent vs number percent when compared conditions composed number cooperative games followed number uncooperative games number percent vs number percent vice versa number percent vs number percent
OWNX--: differences were analyzed using anova aggregated responses
OWNX--: authors interpreted significant interaction support trial trial local contrast effects
MISC--: current article investigates whether sequential context effects operate expert prognostic tasks but takes different theoretical analytical approach
MISC--: when sequential context effects associated cue multi cue judgment task observed they here interpreted mean cue s influence represented its beta weight altered values cue takes over consecutive trials
MISC--: assimilation means when cue values trials t t number different cue s influence smaller than when cue values trials same
MISC--: contrast means when cue values trials t t number different cue s influence larger than when cue values trials same
MISC--: although this interpretation may sound odd psychophysicist consistent traditional methods demonstrating sequential context effects
MISC--: example one way demonstrating effects plot mean response stimulus value current trial function differences between stimulus value current immediately preceding trial
MISC--: figure number example plot using data two clinicians who participated judgment task wherein they estimated number patients risk chd based eight cues task will described detail below
OWNX--: here we focus diabetes cue illustration
OWNX--: each subject s responses were analyzed separately converted standardized scores allow direct comparison
MISC--: subject number squares solid line shows assimilation mean rating risk current patient biased toward diabetes status prior patient
MISC--: subject number triangles dashed line shows contrast mean ratings biased away diabetes status prior patient
OWNX--: each subject s responses were also analyzed separately using multiple regression diabetes was coded number if present number if absent
OWNX--: table number shows some results
OWNX--: first when responses all number trials were analyzed both subjects shows roughly same size partial beta weights diabetes cue
MISC--: when data categorized according values diabetes cue consecutive trials re analyzed we see how beta weight each subject changes when assimilation contrast takes place
OWNX--: although regression analyses illustrate cue s influence changes when assimilation contrast take place this approach flawed because its piecemeal nature data two subsets trials been analyzed separately
OWNX--: better approach would analyze data all trials simultaneously
MISC--: time series analysis used test hypotheses sequential context effects operating series responses obtained single subject
MISC--: specific models constructed isolate sequential context effects produced cue stimulus series those operating independently judgment response series
CONT--: present article time series approach developed extending ideas discussed context psychophysical research cover multi cue judgment tasks
MISC--: before preceding discuss application time series analysis broad perspective position time series theory methods psychological research needed
OWNX--: next section attempt provide perspective
MISC--: following this discourse illustrative application presented emphasis detecting possible sequential context effects operating expert prognostic judgments risk heart disease
