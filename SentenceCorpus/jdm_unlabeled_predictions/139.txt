MISC--: very small but cumulated decreases food intake may sufficient significant effects even erasing obesity over period years citation
AIMX--: two studies one lab study other real world study we examine effect manipulating position different foods restaurant menu
OWNX--: items placed at beginning end list their category options were up twice popular when they were placed center list
MISC--: given this effect placing healthier menu items at top bottom item lists less healthy ones their center e g sugared drinks vs calorie free drinks should result some increase favor healthier food choices
MISC--: obesity growing problem throughout world
MISC--: fighting via dieting apparently ineffective citation
AIMX--: companion paper rozin et al citation present arguments facts substantiate two claims we shall not repeat here
MISC--: they then suggest war obesity could benefit nudges citation not only heavy efforts investments resources
MISC--: nudges small cheap easily implementable often hardly noticed changes choice architecture i e manner setting choice set presented do not affect choice set itself yet affect appeal different options
MISC--: rozin et al s nudge nobesity very simple if you want increase decrease popularity food item make easier harder access respectively
AIMX--: same spirit present paper explores another possible nudge nobesity
OWNX--: we show placing food item menu at beginning end its category increases its popularity compared placing middle
MISC--: restaurants present customers lists their offerings
MISC--: when menu displayed writing items presented simultaneously
MISC--: when waiter recites day s specials items presented sequentially
OWNX--: our study involved only printed menus
MISC--: menu items may organized various ways type e g soups salads etc
MISC--: according main ingredients fish dishes vegetarian dishes etc
MISC--: 
MISC--: within each category they typically listed vertical ordering
MISC--: when designing menus does this order matter
MISC--: one may seek answers two kinds sources how literature menu design psychological literature position effects
MISC--: familiar position effects primacy recency refer stimuli presented sequentially their dependent variable not usually choice
MISC--: but effect called edge avoidance citation centrality preferences citation middle bias citation center stage effect citation refers choice among simultaneously presented options various names indicate typical findings people choosing array identical options reliably prefer middle ones citation
MISC--: when items not identical effect s manifestation when options presented middle array they chosen more often than when they presented its edges
MISC--: studies do not course apply options position may inherently important theater airplane seats skyscraper floors restaurant tables place queues
MISC--: rather they use options hard imagine why position would matter i
MISC--: number opaque boxes people choose hide seek treasure citation ii
MISC--: similarly what position people place guess answers multiple choice tests citation iii
MISC--: good they choose set identical citation non identical citation goods offered iv
MISC--: what stall they head public bathroom citation etc
MISC--: all studies found placing item middle rather than edges choice set enhanced its popularity
MISC--: we aware only three exceptions there seems advantage being first last simultaneously presented choice set rather than its middle
MISC--: nisbett wilson citation asked their subjects consider linear array number identical pairs stockings fact their subjects were not aware serendipitously found pronounced left right position effect right most object array was also last perused was heavily over chosen p number namely last best
OWNX--: contrast koppell steen citation analyzed real ballot voting data was almost like controlled study inasmuch order candidates names was rotated precinct p number found candidates received greater proportion vote when listed first than when listed any other position p number namely first best
OWNX--: finally christenfeld citation asked respondents choose route between two points either hypothetical maps real
MISC--: destination point could not reached walking straight line but paths chosen had same total length number turns
OWNX--: respondents showed preference path reached making first turn late possible
OWNX--: paths cannot classified into first last middle but possible points taking first turn sense respondents preferred last
OWNX--: contrast all above mentioned findings restaurant trade publications menus advocate both edges namely first last positions where one should place items whose popularity one wants enhance citation
MISC--: recommendations however were never backed research none best our knowledge exists panitz s claim certainly valid but not clear why one needs rely much memory when choosing menu
MISC--: moreover when kincaid corsun citation attempted put other accepted truths regarding impact menu layout item sales empirical test their title question consultants blowing smoke
MISC--: p number was answered affirmative
OWNX--: however since they did not study edge bias specifically we no direct menu results either contrast add edge avoidance we reported above
OWNX--: present study therefore we did not hypothesize bias either favor against middle positioned items but rather checked whether one exists using number tailed significance testing
