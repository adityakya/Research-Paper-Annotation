MISC--: judgments decisions under uncertainty frequently linked prior sequential search relevant information
MISC--: cases subject decide when stop search information
MISC--: evidence accumulation models social cognitive psychology assume active sequential information search until enough evidence been accumulated pass decision threshold
OWNX--: line theories we conceptualize evidence threshold desired level confidence dlc person
MISC--: this model tested against fixed stopping rule one reason decision making against class multi attribute information integrating models
MISC--: series experiments using information board horse race betting demonstrates advantage proposed model measuring individual dlc each subject confirming its correctness two separate stages
MISC--: addition better understanding stopping rule within narrow framework simple heuristics results indicate individual aspiration levels might relevant factor when modelling decision making task analysis statistical environments
MISC--: some use sometimes
MISC--: this short statement newell citation concluded empirical research well known take best heuristic ttb
MISC--: this fast frugal heuristic was introduced gigerenzer hoffrage kleinbolting citation gigerenzer goldstein citation provide alternative traditionally proposed strategies judgment decision making research
OWNX--: according traditional models rational decision requires comprehensive integration all available information about all alternatives
MISC--: integration become computationally complex soon information cues probabilistic numerous
OWNX--: gigerenzer goldstein citation however were able show simulation binary attribute cue paradigm choosing best alternative out two very simple when searching available cues sequential order descending validity probability cue will lead correct decision given discriminates between alternatives deciding direction first discriminating cue
MISC--: stimulus environment they used german cities their population size number features being present cities not this simple three step heuristic containing search rule stopping rule decision rule led decisions same quality comprehensive computational integration entire set cue information
MISC--: termination information search after having found first discriminating cue therefore been called one reason decision making ordm citation
MISC--: term ordm was chosen clear contrast models stand integration all available information usually not reflecting how information was compiled
MISC--: models varying complexity ranging simple tallying complex multiple linear regression citation
MISC--: what they common at least two pieces information need present starting comparison case several cues indicating same option integration available information
MISC--: contrast class ordm we subsume this broad class under term more reason decision making mrdm because search more than one discriminating piece information prerequisite information integration
MISC--: ttb most prominent representative ordm reveals impressively high number correct predictions compared mrdm models citation
MISC--: mathematical results allow ttb rank amongst rational strategies used probabilistic decision making especially but not only when information needs searched
CONT--: however empirical findings concerning use ttb compared mrdm models were heterogeneous
CONT--: while conclusions some studies were generally against use ttb because they found only particular use this strategy citation survey more recent studies shows more evidence use ttb citation
MISC--: one unresolved question fact participants repeatedly showed huge inter intra individual inconsistency using single strategy citation
MISC--: so far there been no statistical environments all participants experiment acted according ttb refrained using
CONT--: but what even more problematic inconsistent use ordm stopping rule
MISC--: most surprising effect was reported newell weston shanks citation testing sequential search paradigm using only two available cues they found number participants number percent their sample continuing information search some instances even when more valid cue discriminated hence completely ignoring fact second cue would not able compensate first information
