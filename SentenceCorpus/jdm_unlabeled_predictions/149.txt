AIMX--: we introduce berlin numeracy test new psychometrically sound instrument quickly assesses statistical numeracy risk literacy
OWNX--: we present number studies n number showing robust psychometric discriminability across number countries e g germany pakistan japan usa diverse samples e g medical professionals general populations mechanical turk web panels
MISC--: analyses demonstrate desirable patterns convergent validity e g numeracy general cognitive abilities discriminant validity e g personality motivation criterion validity e g numerical non numerical questions about risk
MISC--: berlin numeracy test was found strongest predictor comprehension everyday risks e g evaluating claims about products treatments interpreting forecasts doubling predictive power other numeracy instruments accounting unique variance beyond other cognitive tests e g cognitive reflection working memory intelligence
OWNX--: berlin numeracy test typically takes about three minutes complete available multiple languages formats including computer adaptive test automatically scores reports data researchers www
MISC--: riskliteracy
MISC--: org
MISC--: online forum also provides interactive content public outreach education offers recommendation system test format selection
OWNX--: discussion centers construct validity numeracy risk literacy underlying cognitive mechanisms applications adaptive decision support
MISC--: mathematics skills among most influential educational factors contributing economic prosperity industrialized countries citation
MISC--: accordingly there been considerable interest causes consequences numeracy citation refers specifically mathematical quantitative literacy citation
MISC--: more basic levels numeracy concerned real number line time measurement estimation whereas higher levels focus understanding ratio concepts notably fractions proportions percentages probabilities citation
MISC--: much research numeracy involved assessment wide range mathematical skills among large diverse samples
MISC--: more recently however research theory decision sciences focused subset numeracy important informed accurate risky decision making i e statistical numeracy citation
AIMX--: this paper we use statistical numeracy specifically refer understanding operations probabilistic statistical computation comparing transforming probabilities proportions citation
MISC--: statistical aspects numeracy key features risk assessment business engineering citation play central roles health risk quantification communication citation
MISC--: moreover although risk commonly refers many topics citation economic psychological theory long held decision making under risk involving known statistical probabilities quantitative probabilistic reasoning citation
MISC--: ways others statistical numeracy one factor gives rise risk literacy i e ability accurately interpret act information about risk
MISC--: indeed statistical numeracy been shown predictor decision strategies affective reactions comprehension normative choices across many risky economic health consumer decisions citation
MISC--: efforts measure individual differences statistical numeracy risk literacy come primarily three forms
MISC--: some research examines risky decisions relation individual differences overall educational attainment cognitive abilities cognitive styles citation
MISC--: other research primarily focusing clinical health domains developed valid subjective instrument self reported estimations numeracy citation
CONT--: most common however use objective performance measures numeracy i e psychometric tests citation
AIMX--: this paper we review development most widely used statistical numeracy instruments citation examining successes psychometric limits
AIMX--: we then introduce new test statistical numeracy risk literacy i e berlin numeracy test
OWNX--: berlin numeracy test used multiple formats i e computer adaptive paper pencil multiple choice single item median split providing fast valid reliable tool research assessment public outreach
OWNX--: specifically we show new test offers unique predictive validity comprehension everyday risks beyond other cognitive ability numeracy tests e g cognitive reflection working memory span fluid intelligence
AIMX--: furthermore we show berlin numeracy test dramatically improves psychometric discriminability among highly educated individuals e g college students graduates medical professionals across diverse cultures different languages
OWNX--: we close discussion construct validity underlying mechanisms applications e g custom tailored interactive adaptive risk communication
