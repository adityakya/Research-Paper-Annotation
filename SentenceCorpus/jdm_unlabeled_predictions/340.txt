MISC--: research processing recognition information focused testing recognition heuristic rh
MISC--: aggregate noncompensatory use recognition information postulated rh was rejected several studies while rh could still account considerable proportion choices
OWNX--: results explained if either part subjects used rh b nobody used but its choice predictions were accidentally line predictions strategy used
AIMX--: current study exemplifies new approach model testing we determined individuals decision strategies based maximum likelihood classification method taking into account choices response times confidence ratings simultaneously
OWNX--: unlike most previous studies rh our study tested rh under conditions we provided information about cue values unrecognized objects we argue fairly common thus some interest
MISC--: number number percent subjects overall behavior was best explained compensatory parallel constraint satisfaction pcs strategy
CONT--: proportion subjects using enhanced rh heuristic rhe was negligible up number number percent number percent subjects seemed use take best strategy ttb
CONT--: more fine grained analysis supplemental behavioral parameters conditional strategy use supports pcs but calls into question process assumptions apparent users rh rhe ttb within our experimental context
OWNX--: our results consistent previous literature highlighting importance individual strategy classification compared aggregated analyses
MISC--: imagine you visit nice conference southern france
MISC--: your presentation was successful you want reward yourself good wine
MISC--: you offered chateau teyssier chateau margaux
MISC--: waiter presents you both bottles
MISC--: you not tried wines before but you remember having heard chateau margaux
OWNX--: offered number chateau teyssier st
MISC--: emilion grand cru classification
MISC--: chateau margaux medoc premier cru classification number
MISC--: how would you predict wine you will like better
OWNX--: simple strategy would select wine you recognize
OWNX--: alternatively you might compare bottles available cues stepwise manner starting instance region instantly choose chateau teyssier because you know wine st
MISC--: emilion region usually meets your preferences
MISC--: you could weigh all pieces information against each other taking into account their importance also their constellation
MISC--: you might quickly come up consistent interpretation all pieces information although chateau margaux outstanding classification well known would suboptimal drink wine so early
MISC--: chateau teyssier clearly preferable because comes excellent region good classification been sufficiently matured
AIMX--: this paper we investigate how recognition information processed integrated other available cue information decisions
MISC--: particularly we compare whether people apply simple noncompensatory strategies like two strategies known recognition heuristic rh applied situation known cue values take best heuristic ttb enhanced version rh combines them rhe whether people alternatively rely more complex partially automatic processes generate consistent interpretations referred parallel constraint satisfaction pcs strategy
MISC--: most previous research processing recognition information focused testing against rh
