CONT--: advantage models do not use flexible parameters one precisely show what degree they predict behavior what situations
MISC--: three issues this journal recognition heuristic been examined carefully many points view
CONT--: we comment here four themes use optimization models understand rationality heuristics generalization recognition input beyond binary judgment new conditions less more effects importance specifying boundary conditions cognitive heuristics
MISC--: galileo formalized movement objects his law falling bodies s s stevens citation described sensation stimulus intensity raised power behaviorists citation formulated laws learning equations no more complex than those encountered high school physics
MISC--: simple models physics psychology driven much progress science
OWNX--: yet no model simple complex explain all behavior
MISC--: beauty simple models one easily discover their limits their boundary conditions turn fosters clarity progress
MISC--: law falling bodies does not hold generally works situations object starts rest there no air resistance gravitational force g does not change over distance fall
MISC--: similarly laws learning do not hold every situation illustrated concept biological preparedness fact certain cs ucs conditional stimulus unconditional stimulus associations learned rapidly but not others citation
MISC--: evolved organisms work multiple tools not one general principle
MISC--: concept adaptive toolbox assumes individual culture species characterized set heuristics surviving uncertain world
OWNX--: heuristics exploit evolved learned core capacities simple order robust fast efficient
MISC--: recognition heuristic one tools adaptive toolbox humans other animal species exploits recognition memory
OWNX--: this journal devoted three special issues elaborating generalizing testing model we proposed decade ago citation
OWNX--: we reviewed progress made first decade before citation here we would like comment some theoretical insights put forward contributions issues
