MISC--: would you redirect trolley save five people even if means trolley will run over person side track
MISC--: most people say they would
MISC--: would you push same person into path trolley order save five
MISC--: most people say they would not
MISC--: sorts intuitive moral judgments made rapidly seem almost automatic
MISC--: now imagine combined choice context where one redirect trolley push person its path do nothing
MISC--: number lives lost intervening varied
MISC--: most straightforward interpretations current theories moral judgment predict either no effect combined context will lead greater focus lives lost
OWNX--: contrast we observe similarity effect utilitarian choice may become less attractive combined choice context
MISC--: moral judgments often contrasted mundane secular decision making consumer choice
MISC--: latter predominantly involves weighing costs benefits often may not preferred strategy moral situations
MISC--: now classic trolley problem citation runaway trolley threatens run over kill five people trapped railroad track
MISC--: if switch flipped trolley will move onto another track saving five but killing person trapped track
MISC--: footbridge version only way save five push large person off bridge stop trolley
MISC--: most people approve flipping switch but disapprove pushing person patterns so consistent some claimed they universal citation
MISC--: reluctance push person often described example deontological decision making where focus intrinsic goodness badness actions per se rather than instrumental outcomes
MISC--: asymmetry between switch pushing scenarios been used effective tool developing evaluating theories moral judgment citation
MISC--: one popular distinction doctrine double effect differentiates between harm caused means harm caused side effect
MISC--: harm means when actor uses body single victim prevent death larger number people considered impermissible
MISC--: harm side effect however when trolley kills single victim after redirected sidetrack considered permissible
MISC--: other relevant distinctions between direct indirect harm citation intervention victim versus intervention harmful object citation
MISC--: number other studies varied plethora other factors associated action spatial distance citation physical contact between actor victim citation temporal order events sinnott armstrong et al number further advancing our understanding role properties intervention moral choice
MISC--: although most research trolley problems focused factors associated intervention others looked at role utility outcomes
MISC--: example sacrificing stranger approved more than sacrificing relative but sacrificing obnoxious person nazi soldier approved more than sacrificing stranger citation
MISC--: similarly lives group members valued more than lives out group members citation
MISC--: additional indicator sensitivity outcomes when number lives at stake increases approval intervention save lives increases too citation
MISC--: finally trolley dilemmas been shown influenced framing experimental question
CONT--: positive framing focusing attention number lives saved intervention leads greater approval action than negative framing focuses number lives lost result intervention citation
OWNX--: our study concerned context effects based combining two classic scenarios into one where actor throw switch redirect trolley push person off footbridge do nothing
OWNX--: standard case omission leads five deaths pushing causes one death we vary number deaths associated redirecting trolley
MISC--: current moral theories typically do not make explicit predictions about extended context comparisons though most straightforward interpretations suggest combined contexts increase attention outcomes
MISC--: example mikhail citation proposed switch version two side tracks one there person other empty
MISC--: under this condition redirecting trolley onto track single person becomes morally prohibited
OWNX--: our study however we varied both action outcomes way no choice transparently dominated any other choice
MISC--: specifically one our combined contexts actor could push large person off footbridge sacrificing one person save five throw switch redirect trolley away five but putting side track where two people will die do nothing case five people die
MISC--: pushing person less desirable than throwing switch all else equal but killing two people less desirable than killing one
MISC--: if combined choice context increases attention outcomes then mikhail s analysis action throwing switch should rated more negatively because there option available leading fewer deaths
MISC--: same reason act pushing one person save five should if anything become relatively more desirable
MISC--: alternatively action pushing may seen always wrong so disapproval pushing would not affected context
OWNX--: we collected pilot data combined contexts appeared undermine seemingly straightforward predictions
MISC--: particular presence switch option led less approval pushing person even when throwing switch led more deaths
MISC--: this led us consider different form choice context effect similarity effect
OWNX--: we know no theory moral judgment predicts similarity effects
OWNX--: what follows we first describe similarity effects closely related context effects then turn study aimed at examining choice context effects
MISC--: toc paragraph choice context effects
MISC--: h number class paragraph sec anchor choice context effects
MISC--: h number sec end challenges moral psychology faces when extrapolating results binary moral dilemmas broader contexts shows parallels development choice theory citation
MISC--: suppose we interested how much consumers like number prospective car models
MISC--: one way ask them how much they willing pay given model
MISC--: shortcoming this method lacks reference point person compares item so many cases answers will not very informative
OWNX--: another way try capture consumer choices simply use binary comparisons where consumers choose more preferred car all possible pairwise comparisons
OWNX--: we transform choices into some preference metric will tell us relative ranking each car compared rest
OWNX--: further since scale will assume transitivity we even rely partial information where if we do not data direct comparison between cars c we still infer what people will choose based other comparisons two cars participated citation
MISC--: early promising attempts model choice behavior were quickly undermined new findings wider range paradigms citation
MISC--: depending particular configuration choice set addition new option been found systematically change preferences
OWNX--: several context effects been identified citation present purposes we focus similarity compromise effects
OWNX--: addition we consider context effect associated separate versus joint evaluation so called evaluability hypothesis citation
MISC--: toc paragraph similarity compromise evaluability
MISC--: h number class paragraph sec anchor similarity compromise evaluability
OWNX--: h number sec end imagine buyer choose between toyota prius ford focus all she cares about price fuel economy
MISC--: toyota prius gets better gas mileage but ford focus compensates having lower price
OWNX--: further imagine our hypothetical scenario she finds herself roughly indifferent number number between two options
CONT--: early work rational choice theory recognized when additional options become available new options might well attract choices but theories did assume relative preference between initial set prius focus our example would remain same
MISC--: many empirical studies however established people often violate this independence principle
MISC--: similarity effect citation adding non dominated option close one alternatives tends increase relative share its competitor
MISC--: example if we add honda insight choice set slightly worse than prius fuel efficiency but slightly better price buyer who was previously indifferent about prius focus options typically shifts preferring focus over prius
OWNX--: informally we could say insight steals more choices prius than focus
MISC--: alternatively see figure number imagine adding honda civic choice set rather than honda insight assume civic more similar focus being slightly better gas mileage but slightly more expensive
MISC--: now relative choice between prius focus should shift towards prius civic competes more focus than prius
OWNX--: we refer this choice context effects similarity effect
MISC--: addition similarity effect two other types context effect potentially relevant current work
OWNX--: first compromise effect whereby introducing third option results one first two being seen compromise leads increase choices compromise option citation
MISC--: continuing car example if we add third option nissan leaf example much better gas mileage than prius but also significantly more expensive then prius will become compromise studies show being middle often increases consumer preferences citation
MISC--: conversely adding cheaper less fuel efficient option prius versus focus choice set may make focus compromise lead being favored
OWNX--: how might compromise effects work our hypothetical scenario
MISC--: let s begin our example throwing switch save five people but leading death two people versus doing nothing
OWNX--: adding option pushing one person save five could make throwing switch compromise between saving more versus fewer lives all else equal avoiding actions leading any deaths
MISC--: this leads counter intuitive notion adding push option may make throwing switch more desirable
OWNX--: final context effect we will mention stems work separate versus joint evaluation
MISC--: imagine you assign value two dictionaries one very good condition containing number number words other fair condition but number number words
MISC--: hsee citation found smaller dictionary priced higher than larger one when each evaluated isolation separate evaluation but smaller dictionary received lower pricing than larger one joint evaluation
MISC--: according evaluability hypothesis number words not very meaningful piece information separate evaluation because there no reference point comparison
MISC--: result number words becomes more important dimension joint rather than separate evaluation citation
MISC--: same way our scenario where throwing switch leads two people dying but five being saved evaluability may shift direction outcome utility when option pushing single person save five added
MISC--: this would lead throwing switch option becoming less desirable citation
MISC--: moral choices equally susceptible choice set context effects
OWNX--: our initial hunch was instrumental choices would based evaluability
OWNX--: but we also considered possibility options evoking deontological rules might not susceptible context effects
MISC--: example option saving three lives might seen quite positive itself but lose its value when there option available would save four lives
MISC--: but inappropriate immoral act like pushing person off bridge may remain immoral equally bad even when instrumentally less desirable options added
MISC--: trolley footbridge problems conceptualized comprised choice set having two dimensions one representing value utility number people saved lost other representing value cost intrinsic actions themselves including inaction
MISC--: this latter dimension useful basic distinction difference between throwing switch acceptable versus pushing person unacceptable when instrumental outcomes same
MISC--: addition baron his collaborators citation shown when harmful outcomes at stake people often choose do nothing showing omission bias
MISC--: example one would expect given choice between doing nothing one person dies versus throwing switch one person dies people will show strong preference do nothing
OWNX--: combining observations dimension forms action leading harm this context omission preferable throwing switch turn greatly preferable pushing person
MISC--: dimension lives lost less better
MISC--: two hypothetical dimensions set stage examining context effects
OWNX--: next section we present empirical study compares preferences action omission five different choice sets
MISC--: key comparison between two three alternative choice sets trilemmas same omission footbridge intervention options but differ number victims switch intervention
MISC--: if approvals two shared options pushing omission differ function properties third option this will demonstrate context effect may take form similarity effect compromise effect evaluability effect
OWNX--: determine form choice context effect ratings will compared two alternative versions scenarios
MISC--: predictions different theories context effects summarized after description design
