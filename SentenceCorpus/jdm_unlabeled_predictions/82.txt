MISC--: when making decisions involve tradeoffs between quality timing desirable outcomes people consistently discount value future outcomes
MISC--: puzzling finding regarding decisions extremely high rate at people discount future monetary outcomes
MISC--: most economists would argue decision makers should turn down only rates return lower than those available them elsewhere
MISC--: yet vast majority studies find discount rates significantly higher than market interest rates citation
OWNX--: here we ask whether lack knowledge about normative strategy explain high discount rates
OWNX--: initial experiment nearly half subjects did not spontaneously cite elements normative strategy when asked how people should make intertemporal monetary decisions
OWNX--: two follow up experiments after subjects read financial guide detailing normative strategy discount rates declined up number percent but were still higher than market interest rates
OWNX--: this decline persisted though attenuated at least one month
OWNX--: final experiment peer generated advice influenced discount rates similar manner expert advice arguments focusing normative considerations were at least effective others
MISC--: studies show part explanation high discount rates lack knowledge regarding normative strategy they quantify how much discount rates reduced response normative arguments
MISC--: given high level discounting remains however there other contributing factors high discount rates remain quantified
