MISC--: what role recognition consumer choice
MISC--: recognition heuristic rh proposes situations where recognition correlated decision criterion recognized objects will chosen more often than unrecognized ones regardless any other relevant information available about recognized object
MISC--: past research investigated this non compensatory decision heuristic inference
OWNX--: here we report two experiments preference using naturalistic consumer choice task
OWNX--: results revealed although recognition was powerful driver preferences was used compensatory rather than non compensatory way
MISC--: specifically additional information learned about recognized brand objects significantly affected choices
MISC--: appears recognition processed compensatory manner combined other attributes preferential choice
OWNX--: we tend like what we know
MISC--: studies mere exposure effect citation decades experience product manufacturers advertisers confirm our preferences products other objects tend related their familiarity brand awareness citation
MISC--: but what precisely mechanism familiarity recognition guides choice
MISC--: this article asks whether choice sometimes guided non compensatory mechanism recognition heuristic rh
MISC--: rh been primarily investigated inferential choice domains larger city frankfurt koblenz
MISC--: simple tool adaptive tool box human judgment decision making proposed gigerenzer todd abc research group citation
MISC--: researchers shown unlike classical decision strategies e g linear regression bayesian models aim maximize integration relevant knowledge gain statistically optimal prediction decision criterion efficient inferences drawn minimal knowledge this case mere recognition
MISC--: additionally rh was proposed most applicable situations where knowledge limited not all entities choice set recognized citation
MISC--: there various other domains recognition knowledge limited where choices depend preferences rather than inferences
MISC--: one obvious example consumer choice
MISC--: everyone knows firms invest huge sums money advertising
MISC--: although many advertisements informative often their purpose simply increase brand awareness
MISC--: firms attempt repeatedly expose consumers brand names hope achieving positive brand image customer loyalty
BASE--: present study aims investigate exact role brand recognition consumer choice
MISC--: more specifically aims see whether under certain circumstances participants will rely recognition choice strategy regardless any other information they may about recognized well known brand
MISC--: instance when choosing between two brands chocolate only one brand recognized participants may employ simple heuristic choose recognized brand
MISC--: alternatively they may combine recognition other information known about brand whether manufacturer good poor environmental record
MISC--: present research therefore extends past studies recognition heuristic into new domain preferential choice
