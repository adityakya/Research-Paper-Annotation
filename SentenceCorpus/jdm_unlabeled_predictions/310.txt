MISC--: impaired decision behavior been repeatedly observed schizophrenia patients
OWNX--: we investigated several cognitive mechanisms might contribute jumping conclusions bias jtc seen schizophrenia patients biases information gathering information weighting integration overconfidence using process tracing paradigm mouselab
MISC--: mouselab allows depth exploration various decision making processes structured information environment
MISC--: total number schizophrenia patients number healthy controls participated experiment
MISC--: although showing less focused systematic information search schizophrenia patients practically considered all pieces information showed no jtc sense collecting less pieces evidence
MISC--: choices patients controls both approximated rational solution quite well but patients showed more extreme confidence ratings
OWNX--: both groups mainly used weighted additive decision strategies information integration only small proportion relied simple heuristics
MISC--: under high stress induced affective valence plus time pressure however schizophrenia patients switched equal weighting strategies less valid cues more valid ones were weighted equally
MISC--: hasty decision making hallmark feature presently deluded schizophrenia patients
MISC--: look stranger sounds telephone line certain initials number plates mistaken proof conspiracy surveillance
MISC--: cognitive studies asserted this so called jumping conclusions bias jtc paranoid schizophrenia not confined idiosyncratic delusions related scenarios but extends neutral situations citation
MISC--: while jtc somewhat aggravated among schizophrenia citation sometimes also non schizophrenia patients acute persecutory delusions citation other studies found this bias also remitted paranoid schizophrenia patients citation
MISC--: recently jtc been found correlate delusion conviction citation
MISC--: number researchers ascribe jtc fundamental role pathogenesis delusions fixed false beliefs citation
MISC--: traditionally jtc been investigated beads probabilistic reasoning task subject consecutively presented sequence beads drawn either jar predominantly contains beads example green jar predominantly contains beads red citation
MISC--: chain events usually strongly favours one jars
OWNX--: compared both healthy psychiatric controls schizophrenia patients make early premature incautious decisions number number percent cases i e they decide after only one bead been drawn
MISC--: when presented entire available information all at once group differences abolished
MISC--: addition probability ratings usually not discrepant indicating patients data gathering bias rather than deficits probabilistic reasoning
BASE--: citation our group confirmed this bias ruling out deficits memory poor motivation confounding factors citation
MISC--: others found this bias not result impulsivity citation
MISC--: using experimental variant who wants millionaire quiz patients schizophrenia irrespective current delusional ideation displayed lowered decision threshold they over interpreted available amount evidence citation
CONT--: precise nature jtc not entirely understood under some circumstances enhanced ambiguity multiple response options bias may even diminished abolished citation
MISC--: jtc conceptualized different ways
MISC--: core contribution this paper investigate jtc data gathering bias less information taken into account decision making relative controls overconfidence predictive value information over interpreted relative controls suboptimal information weighting integration validity cues not considered appropriately heuristics more strongly preferred relative controls
MISC--: our group recently investigated second aspect we repeatedly found patients schizophrenia overconfident erroneous decisions citation so far been mainly investigated context memory tasks citation
OWNX--: we also found patients tend reach more incautious decisions when asked deduce correct title classical paintings especially under stress citation conforms other studies assigning stress arousal aggravating role cognitive biases disorder lincoln lange burau exner moritz press
OWNX--: present study we used task assesses data gathering confidence information integration aspect jtc single paradigm
OWNX--: we were especially interested investigate cue selection patients since striking feature schizophrenia patients reliance unreliable sources information e g internet fora conspiracy theories
MISC--: jtc may not problem if rested most valid pieces information indeed cognitive research found subgroup healthy subjects adopt so called take best heuristic citation application this heuristic some environments leads good decisions citation
MISC--: although beads task remains gold standard capture jtc does not shed light this aspect decision making sequence events pre determined
MISC--: moreover beads task estimates jtc basis single item reducing its reliability
OWNX--: final aim was investigate impact stress exerted time pressure emotionally framed scenarios within subjects
CONT--: basis available literature we expected patients schizophrenia szs collect less h number particularly less valid h number information show less systematic information search inspecting less valid information first h number over confident their judgments h number biases might more pronounced under conditions stress induced time pressure affective framing task h number compared controls cps
MISC--: following exploratory account we investigated whether there differences choice accuracy whether subjects particularly rely take best strategy if there relation between schizophrenia severity measures i e panss see below different aspects jtc biases
