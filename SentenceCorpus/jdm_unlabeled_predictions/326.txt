MISC--: two most influential models delay discounting research been exponential e hyperbolic h models
MISC--: we develop new methodology design binary choice questions exponential hyperbolic discount rates purposefully manipulated make their rate parameters orthogonal pearson s r number negatively correlated r number positively correlated r number hold one rate constant while allowing other vary
OWNX--: then we extend method similarly contrast different versions hyperboloid model
MISC--: arithmetic discounting model based differences between present future rewards rather than their ratios may easily made orthogonal any other pair models
OWNX--: our procedure makes possible design choice stimuli precisely vary relationship between different discount rates
MISC--: however additional control over correlation between different discount rate parameters may require researcher either restrict range those rate parameters take expand range times participant must wait future rewards
MISC--: few exceptions people prefer receive reward now rather than at later date people also prefer receive larger rewards than smaller rewards
MISC--: but when choice offered between smaller reward now versus larger reward later then two rules behavior conflict
MISC--: people must find some way resolving conflict make their choice
MISC--: firms must also choose between outcomes at different times future now
MISC--: classical economics accountancy finance all agree single normative method this should done value all future gains terms their present value
MISC--: if sum money p present value will grow future amount f following risk free process continuously compounded interest then p said present value future payment f said discounted p continuous compounding exponential model growth normative model known exponential discounting
MISC--: however people consistently depart this normative model two distinct ways
OWNX--: first people not exponential discounters they discount more heavily than exponential short term less heavily than exponential long term
MISC--: important implication this decreasing impatience people will make inconsistent preference reversals simply due passage time
MISC--: researchers suggested form people s behavioral discounting better modeled hyperbolic discounting citation whose mathematics reflects processes simple interest citation
MISC--: second departure people far more likely choose present payoffs relative future payoffs than they should
OWNX--: seen through lens exponential model this impulsivity favor present reward p implies people demand wildly high level interest get them choose future reward f often order magnitude greater than any bank would offer
MISC--: therefore form people s discounting non exponential size their discounting unreasonable
MISC--: also been found magnitude p f not just their ratios may affect people s choices citation finding implied killeen s citation additive utility model discounting arithmetic discounting citation special case killeen s model underlying behavioral model underpinned analogy excess wages required waiting f rather than analogies simple compound interest
MISC--: using simulation studies navarro pitt myung citation shown how psychological models may difficult distinguish each other so deciding model better captures people s decision making remains equivocal despite scrutiny many empirical studies
OWNX--: exponential hyperbolic models delay discounting could taken one intrinsically confusable pair after all how distinguishable models simple interest compound interest really
OWNX--: section number our analysis two frequently used research designs seems support this view rate parameters three different delay discounting models all highly inter correlated
MISC--: interestingly navarro et al suggest good way improve separation between models improve experimental design they achieve their simulations information integration models noting models make different predictions if trials added only visual only auditory stimuli presented
MISC--: similar purposeful approach evident glockner betsch citation who search decision tasks diagnostic between competing models risky choice
MISC--: similarly present article develops tools separation may improved between different models delay discounting designs even constructed exponential discounting hyperbolic discounting make opposite predictions see sections number number
MISC--: navarro myung pitt kim citation see part their research agenda encouraging researchers explore landscape their favorite computational model cognition
