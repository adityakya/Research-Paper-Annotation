MISC--: assumption people possess repertoire strategies solve inference problems they face been made repeatedly
MISC--: experimental findings two previous studies strategy selection reexamined learning perspective argues people learn select strategies making probabilistic inferences
MISC--: this learning process modeled strategy selection learning ssl theory assumes people develop subjective expectancies strategies they
MISC--: they select strategies proportional their expectancies updated basis experience
MISC--: study newell weston shanks citation shown people did not anticipate success strategy beginning experiment
OWNX--: instead behavior observed at end experiment was result learning process described ssl theory
MISC--: second study broder schiffer citation ssl theory able provide explanation why participants only slowly adapted new environments dynamic inference situation
MISC--: reanalysis previous studies illustrates importance learning probabilistic inferences
MISC--: how do people make probabilistic inferences inferring selling price car severity illness likely winner tennis match
MISC--: different strategies applied make inferences integrating all available information predict criterion
MISC--: fact many researchers argued people equipped repertoire different cognitive strategies making judgments decisions citation
MISC--: do people apply different strategies solving probabilistic inferences
MISC--: if so how do they select their strategy repertoire
MISC--: cost benefit approach strategy selection argues people trade off strategies anticipated costs benefits
MISC--: contrast i will argue selection achieved via learning people learn success failure strategies through experience select strategy based past success
MISC--: i will describe computational theory specifies this learning process citation will use explain people s probabilistic inferences two previous studies
