MISC--: construction social preferences often requires one reconcile various social motives concern unfavorable inequality maximization social welfare
OWNX--: we propose novel theory whereby people s level agency influences relative intensities their social motives thus their social preferences
MISC--: agency this context refers decision makers active involvement processes produce social outcomes
MISC--: nonagentic decision makers not involved creating outcomes
MISC--: therefore comparison between self others highly informative them they shun settings their outcome appears inferior
MISC--: conversely agentic decision makers who take action influence social outcomes care more about others outcomes more inclined promote social welfare
OWNX--: we report five studies testing agency hypothesis
MISC--: participants were presented realistic scenarios involving outcomes themselves another person
OWNX--: each scenario outcome oneself was fixed while outcome other person varied
MISC--: participants task was indicate their satisfaction other person obtaining either same outcome their own better one
OWNX--: we found participants who were involved creating outcomes agentic condition were more satisfied other getting better option than were participants who were not involved nonagentic condition
OWNX--: even low levels influence outcomes were sufficient strong agency effect occur
OWNX--: we discuss agency hypothesis relation theories social preference effects voicing participation decision processes trade offs public policy
OWNX--: imagine following scenario
OWNX--: after buying new camera you find out colleague yours bought same camera
MISC--: you consider possibility she might bought camera less than you so you ask her how much she paid
MISC--: would you rather find out she paid same price you less
MISC--: two conflicting reactions might surface your mind
OWNX--: particular you might worry your outcome would look poorer comparison thus you would prefer find out she paid same price not less
OWNX--: yet you might hope find out she paid less since this benefits her does not cost you anything
MISC--: people s reactions scenarios reflect their social preferences their satisfaction social outcomes obtained themselves others citation
MISC--: decision makers social preferences settings like camera scenario involve conflict between two social motives avoidance inferior social comparisons concern about well being others
MISC--: we propose decision makers resolution conflict hence their social preferences depend their experience agency setting
MISC--: thus people s social preferences depend heavily whether not they role creating outcomes
MISC--: people tend more other regarding their preferences extent they agency situation
OWNX--: role agency been documented recent studies participants were first paid performing task lab were then asked consider pay another matched participant same task citation
OWNX--: participants one condition were asked determine salary matched participant while participants another condition were asked indicate how satisfied they would various predetermined salaries matched participant
MISC--: participants who chose outcomes were far more generous than participants who rated their satisfaction predetermined outcomes
MISC--: particular they were more likely favor option paying another participant more than they had received themselves
MISC--: choshen hillel yaniv citation attributed this shift social preference participants level agency
MISC--: individuals considered nonagentic when they experience social outcomes were not brought about their intentional actions
MISC--: contrast individuals considered agentic when they act purposefully produce social outcomes outcomes being related their actions
OWNX--: how might agency affect social preferences
MISC--: proposed theory draws insights theories social comparison social utility
MISC--: been suggested individuals generally sensitive social comparisons tend draw self inferences based differences they observe between themselves others citation
MISC--: people said interpret differences favor others negative signals about their own social status citation consequently tend shun settings evoke uncomfortable comparisons citation
MISC--: our suggestion settings where individuals hold nonagentic roles their inequality aversion so strong dominates their prosocial motives citation
MISC--: individuals who hold agentic roles however balance between motives changes
MISC--: agentic individuals do not view comparison conveying important social information since consequence their own deliberate action
MISC--: being involved creating outcomes others they also care more about welfare others effect consistent notions warm glow citation welfare maximization citation
MISC--: thus agentic individuals compared nonagentic ones pay less attention unfavorable inequalities care more about maximizing social welfare
OWNX--: our theoretical analysis suggests people construct their social preferences depending their level agency setting
MISC--: applying this analysis camera scenario implies people should express more other regarding preferences when they involved creating outcome other person than when they not
