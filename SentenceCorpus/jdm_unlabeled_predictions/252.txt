MISC--: duration ownership been shown increase valuation items people currently own well items they owned past phenomenon termed length ownership effect
OWNX--: we hypothesize duration exposure item will foster increased pre ownership attachment item increased valuations manner similar duration actual ownership
OWNX--: we examine this effect two experiments both variations classic mug experiment
OWNX--: induce different levels exposure we varied amount time participants examined auctioned item i e coffee mugs prior participating real dollar auctions
OWNX--: first study participants bid online english open bid auctions
OWNX--: second study participants bid first price sealed bid auctions
MISC--: both cases duration physical contact positively influenced valuations i e bid levels
MISC--: ownership item been shown increase owner s valuation phenomenon termed endowment effect
MISC--: most widely held explanation endowment effect manifestation asymmetry value kahneman tversky citation call loss aversion based observation loss greater subjective effect than does equivalent gain
MISC--: extant literature suggests endowment affects monetary valuations moment individual gains factual ownership item
OWNX--: this reason kahneman knetsch thaler citation used term instant endowment effect
BASE--: strahilevitz loewenstein citation extended this notion suggesting although adaptation ownership begins immediately following endowment complete adaptation ownership likely take time
OWNX--: strahilevitz loewenstein suggested adaptation ownership need not all nothing because individuals may not adapt instantaneously fully either acquisition loss item
MISC--: series experiments they demonstrate duration ownership increases valuations items people currently own well items they owned past
CONT--: however several recent studies suggested endowment effect may affect valuations even sooner i e before actual ownership takes place citation
MISC--: example casey citation discovered gap between participants compensation demanded their willingness pay lottery tickets even absence actual ownership
MISC--: likewise sen johnson citation found merely possessing coupon product increased consumer s preference product manner similar ownership
MISC--: carmon et al citation showed simply thinking about option created sense pre factual ownership option increased sense loss after choosing alternative option
MISC--: findings consistent earlier work dhar simonson citation who observed making option focus comparison enhanced its perceived attractiveness probability would selected
MISC--: hoch loewenstein citation suggested change individual s reference point accompanies partial ownership good
MISC--: they note after partially adapting possession good consumers may feel deprived if they subsequently unable fully acquire item
MISC--: result hoch loewenstein suggested consumer who partially adapts ownership good may increased motivation acquire item
OWNX--: if conjectures true then we should expect partial adaptation ownership begin immediately following initiation physical contact item intensify duration contact
MISC--: this article investigates effect duration exposure i e duration physical contact valuations two separate experiments makes several contributions growing literature endowment effect
MISC--: related experimental work citation found duration auction participation operationalized terms number rounds bidder was allowed participate affect bidder s valuation auctioned item
BASE--: however our work first investigate effect duration exposure item valuations where exposure operationalized amount time participants tactilely examine item before bidding
OWNX--: accomplish this we performed two variations classic mug experiment
OWNX--: induce different levels exposure we varied amount time participants examined mugs before placing their bids
OWNX--: first study participants bid first price sealed bid auctions
MISC--: second study participants bid online english open bid auctions
OWNX--: data both studies suggest duration exposure affects valuations manner similar duration ownership examining item longer periods time resulted greater attachment item thus higher valuations
OWNX--: we therefore show effects observed strahilevitz loewenstein s citation study do not appear rely factual ownership per se but were result increased subjective feeling ownership pseudo endowment induced increased duration physical possession object
MISC--: our findings also suggest subjective feelings ownership may affect valuations much more quickly than prior researchers envisioned
