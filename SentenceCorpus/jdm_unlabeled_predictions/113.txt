MISC--: heuristic decision making models like take best rely environmental regularities
MISC--: they conduct limited search ignore available information assuming there structure decision making environment
MISC--: take best relies at least two regularities diminishing returns says information found earlier search more important than information found later correlated information says information found early search predictive information found later
OWNX--: we develop new approaches determining search orders measuring cue discriminability make reliance take best regularities clear open manipulation
OWNX--: we then demonstrate well studied german cities environment three new city environments when how regularities support take best
MISC--: do this we focus not accuracy take best most previous studies but measure its coherence decision making process
MISC--: particular we consider whether take best decisions based single piece information justified because exhaustive search information unlikely yield different decision
AIMX--: using this measure we show when two environmental regularities present decisions made limited search unlikely changed after exhaustive search but both regularities often necessary
OWNX--: number olympics was first time professionals us nba league were allowed play men s basketball competition
MISC--: us dream team filled stars like michael jordan magic johnson larry bird charles barkley patrick ewing was one most dominant teams ever assembled any sporting competition
MISC--: their closest game was number number victory final over croatia head coach chuck daly never felt need call timeout during tournament
CONT--: making predictions about outcomes sporting contests notoriously difficult but dream team made some predictions easy
MISC--: imagine trying predict whether not us would beat its first opponent tournament angola examining players each team beginning starting five moving bench players
MISC--: at some point early us list maybe after jordan johnson bird barkley ewing there would no need look further
MISC--: no matter who else was us roster angolan roster outcome already clear
MISC--: dream team also made predictions easy during course games
MISC--: about number minutes play first half against angola us led number number
OWNX--: was clear us would win large margin without needing watch rest game
MISC--: both decisions about us victory non compensatory because not all available information used so ignored information cannot compensate change decision based information used
OWNX--: remaining player rosters not examined rest game not watched
MISC--: yet decision forego further information seems sensible both cases
MISC--: not reaction limited time cognitive resources but recognition nature environment decision making taking place
