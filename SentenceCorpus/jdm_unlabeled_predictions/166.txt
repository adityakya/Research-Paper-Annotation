OWNX--: we examine how almost winning roulette affects subsequent betting behavior
OWNX--: our main finding heterogeneity gambler behavior some gamblers less likely bet numbers were near misses prior spin other gamblers more likely bet near miss numbers
OWNX--: using unique data set game rapid roulette we model likelihood gambler betting near miss number while controlling favorite number bias likelihood number being near miss
OWNX--: we also find no evidence near misses roulette leads gamblers extending time spent gambling placing more bets
MISC--: near miss events occur wide variety domains including gambling sports natural disasters industrial accidents
MISC--: depending upon domain there differing definitions near miss
MISC--: within gaming literature reid citation defines near miss special kind failure reach goal one comes close being successful p number griffiths citation shortens failures close being successful p number harrigan citation interprets failure was close win p number
MISC--: harrigan citation notes some prefer term near win more logical description gambling event under consideration but term near miss prevails
MISC--: context industrial accidents dillon tinsley citation suggest event considered near miss if outcome non hazardous but if hazardous fatal outcome could occurred p number subsequent paper they offer definition successful outcomes chance plays critical role averting failure citation
MISC--: central definitions near miss belief associated feelings one almost won but didn t almost lost but didn t
MISC--: locke citation uses term aww schucks
OWNX--: capture feeling almost winning we add was close one
MISC--: capture feeling avoiding accident
MISC--: importance near miss events they affect decisions made subsequent each event
MISC--: example there experimental evidence near misses lead gamblers play longer
OWNX--: early research strickland grote citation showed subjects exposed high proportion winning symbols first two wheels three wheel slot machine tended gamble longer but this result could not replicated reid citation under slightly different experimental conditions
MISC--: however subsequent studies found experimental evidence near misses slot machine games lead more games played citation increased playing time citation
MISC--: although most research near miss effect focused slot machine gambling some research examined near miss effect other casino games
MISC--: dixon citation found subjects playing simulated roulette game rated losing outcomes closer winning both when they were close location winning number when they were numerically close winning number

MISC--: near misses also affect decision making away casino floor
MISC--: project management domain dillon tinsley citation provide evidence near misses often viewed successes lead managers make subsequent riskier decisions
OWNX--: specifically dillon tinsley provide experimental evidence managers who make decisions result near misses evaluated highly managers who make decisions result successes higher than those who fail without near miss
MISC--: further evidence suggests managers who experience near miss events but do not experience failure will then subjectively assess probability future failure lower than objective probability failure leading managers choose riskier alternatives
MISC--: domain natural disasters dillon tinsley cronin citation provide evidence if house avoided flood damage hurricane near miss then subjects were less likely buy flood insurance
MISC--: subjects were also less likely evacuate house had survived past hurricanes without damage
CONT--: explaining this result dillon tinsley cronin citation write people did not update given probabilities they did not calculate new probabilities they simply felt differently about initial probabilities were given
MISC--: thus might said near miss information changes people s frames reference p number
