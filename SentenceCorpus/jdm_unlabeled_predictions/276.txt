MISC--: we examine how adding attractive but unattainable alternative aua set available but less attractive alternatives influences evaluations near vs distant future sets alternatives
MISC--: according construal level theory citation including aua would decrease attractiveness near future sets but may increase attractiveness distant future sets
MISC--: four studies participants imagined choice situation three alternatives
MISC--: some participants fourth alternatives was added was attractive but unattainable
MISC--: half participants each condition imagined making decision near future whereas others imagined making decision distant future
MISC--: participants then evaluated attractiveness entire set alternatives well each alternative separately
OWNX--: we examined choices between jobs computers roommates
MISC--: last study examined negotiations landlord about apartment
OWNX--: consistent our hypothesis aua increased evaluation distant set decreased evaluation near set
MISC--: imagine considering vacation caribbean browsing through offers different vacation packages
OWNX--: all packages seem equally attractive but one them stands out being especially attractive brand new five star hotel offers attractive tours all included quite moderate price
MISC--: closer look discloses this most attractive package offered exclusively members hilton club you not
MISC--: how would existence this very attractive but unattainable alternative aua affect your evaluation set vacation plans travel agency offers
MISC--: would you stay this agency look other agencies
MISC--: some decision makers may find situation annoying
OWNX--: compared aua other vacation plans would seem mediocre entire menu agency offers would lose attractiveness
MISC--: other people however could think fact principle agency attractive vacation packages speaks its favor increase their ratings agency menu offers
MISC--: other cases including aua set alternatives may involve offering especially valuable products indicating they out stock including attractive dishes restaurant s menu indicting they not served day
MISC--: obviously including aua costless
MISC--: good strategy
MISC--: promote sales
MISC--: would reduce increase attractiveness entire set
MISC--: related this question research phantom decoy effect found when choosing between two equally desirable alternatives adding phantom decoy namely alternative worse than both initial alternatives dominated one them increases choice alternative dominates decoy citation
MISC--: example decision maker may feel indifferent between five star restaurant number minutes drive away three star restaurant number minutes drive away
MISC--: offering third alternative four star restaurant number minutes drive away may cause decision maker prefer five star restaurant number minutes drive away citation
MISC--: both phantom decoys auas irrelevant
MISC--: unlike phantom decoy however aua more attractive than other alternatives
OWNX--: we investigate impact attractive but irrelevant alternative evaluation entire set alternatives
OWNX--: we suggest temporal distance making choice one factor may determine influence attractive but unattainable alternatives auas evaluation entire set
OWNX--: specifically based construal level theory citation we propose when alternatives considered proximal future auas decrease attractiveness near future sets but do not decrease even increase attractiveness distant future sets leading interaction between auas temporal distance
OWNX--: what follows we explicate how this prediction derives clt test four studies
MISC--: construal level theory citation proposes psychological distance decision influences individuals evaluations alternatives systematically changing way they construe alternatives
MISC--: people tend construe more psychologically distant alternatives higher level namely using more abstract generalized representations
OWNX--: high level construals abstract essential qualities events therefore consist more central essential features
OWNX--: contrast low level construals may include more peripheral less essential features events
MISC--: thus whereas representations near future events rich details representations distant future events omit secondary incidental features events
MISC--: high level features those when altered removed cause more change situation
MISC--: example academic lecture changing topic lecture typically perceived more substantial change changing room lecture takes place therefore topic higher level feature talk than its location
MISC--: there two non exclusive ways clt might predict distance would increase beneficial impact decrease detrimental impact auas sets alternatives
MISC--: first desirability considerations i e value action s end state constitute high level construal alternative should receive more weight more distant future decision
MISC--: contrast feasibility considerations i e ease difficulty reaching end state constitute low level construal alternative should receive less weight more distant future decision citation
MISC--: because auas definition highly desirable but not feasible they would more attractive more distant future sets
OWNX--: second temporal distance may affect likelihood assimilation versus contrast
MISC--: forster liberman kutchel citation recently showed psychological distance enhances assimilation opposed contrast target category
OWNX--: example one their experiments participants compared their athletic skills either moderately high standard moderately low standard then rated their expected athletic performance athletic competition would take place either next day year later
OWNX--: compared control condition time was not specified distant time perspective enhanced assimilation i e produced high self rating after comparison high standard low self rating after comparison low standard whereas proximal time perspective enhanced contrast i e produced low self rating after comparison high standard high self rating after comparison low standard
MISC--: possibly temporal proximity would make participants more likely contrast aua set cause set evaluated more negatively than without aua
MISC--: temporal distance other hand would reduce contrast produce assimilation set aua
MISC--: result entire set alternatives will not look worse may even look better presence aua than without
OWNX--: we report four studies examine prediction auas decrease attractiveness near future sets but do not decrease even increase attractiveness distant future sets
OWNX--: addition this predicted interaction between time adding aua there might also main effects both factors
MISC--: specifically adding aua might produce either overall assimilation effect overall contrast effect citation
MISC--: temporal distance too might decrease increase attractiveness set alternatives due temporal discounting citation savoring citation respectively
