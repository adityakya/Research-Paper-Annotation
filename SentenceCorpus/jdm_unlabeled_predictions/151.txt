MISC--: slowing climate change will almost certainly require reduction greenhouse gas emissions but agreement who should reduce emissions how much difficult part because self serving bias tendency believe what beneficial oneself also fair
AIMX--: conducting surveys among college students united states china we show each groups displays nationalistic self serving bias judgments fair distribution economic burdens resulting mitigation
OWNX--: yet we also show disguising problem identity parties possible elicit perceptions fairness not influenced national interests
OWNX--: our research reveals self serving bias plays major role difficulty obtaining agreement how implement emissions reductions
OWNX--: disagreement over what constitutes fair climate policy does not appear due cross national differences what constitutes fair distribution burdens
MISC--: interventions mitigate self serving bias may facilitate agreement
MISC--: although debate continues about technical scientific issues surrounding climate change human dimensions problem pose significant impediments developing implementing solutions mitigate its impact
MISC--: slowing climate change will almost certainly require reduction greenhouse gas emissions but agreeing upon who should reduce emissions how much thus far proven intractable problem
MISC--: despite longstanding agreement combating anthropogenic climate change serious issue necessitates international cooperation citation failures occurred copenhagen citation show nations unable agree what constitutes fair sharing emissions reduction burden citation
AIMX--: this paper we show difficulty reaching agreement part due self serving bias pervasive tendency believe what beneficial oneself also fair
CONT--: self serving bias not intrinsic cross cultural differences what judged fair distribution sacrifices may represent primary obstacle standing way agreement
MISC--: alternatively one might consider social dilemma structure problem citation other strategic concerns citation largest obstacles combating climate change
AIMX--: this paper takes structural issues givens implicitly assumes they reason formal agreements needed first place
MISC--: particular pre condition getting parties agree self sacrifice pursuit collective solution reach agreement regarding fair distribution burdens
AIMX--: this paper focuses role self serving bias opposed differing fundamental beliefs about fairness plays impeding agreement
MISC--: countries take part climate change negotiations differ myriad dimensions potential relevance fair assignment burdens including their levels past projected emissions costs mitigation benefits obtained successfully addressing problem
MISC--: research self serving bias citation shows asymmetries between parties dimensions relevant negotiation contribute bias because people place greater weight dimensions support settlement more beneficial themselves citation
MISC--: self serving bias been documented shown play central role negotiation impasse both laboratory studies citation field studies citation
CONT--: moreover because negotiators averse accepting settlements even slightly below what they perceive fair citation because self serving bias leads incongruous perceptions fairness there often no settlement upon all parties will agree even when large joint gains available agreement
MISC--: large number nations involved climate change negotiations makes problem even worse not only increasing complexity over above would exist only two parties but also multiplying number possible self serving arguments
MISC--: illustrate self serving selection fairness norms consider following study van avermaet citation
MISC--: subjects filled out questionnaires were then given money was pay themselves well another person study their work
MISC--: if told other person was given half amount time work completed half many questionnaires subjects kept average two thirds money allocation proportional both time spent work done
MISC--: but if other person was given twice long completed twice number questionnaires subjects instead chose norm equal division kept half money themselves
MISC--: finally subjects tended keep more than half money both case where other person was given twice much time filled out half many questionnaires opposite case half time twice questionnaires
MISC--: this indicates subjects chose time spent work completed fair payment criterion depending was their own favor
MISC--: context climate change difference fairness norms evidenced focus some policy proposals equal entitlement equal per capita emission allotment others relative needs burdens developing versus developed nations citation
MISC--: parties prefer policies lange et al citation show selections fairness criteria agents involved international climate policy tend correspond their material self interest
MISC--: furthermore agents more likely believe self interest influenced other parties selections fairness criteria than believe they themselves were so influenced
BASE--: though this evidence consistent self serving bias conscious self serving arguments lange et al citation propose lange et al s study cannot rule out possibility there legitimate cross cultural differences perceptions what fair differences lead disagreement independent role material self interest
OWNX--: indeed comparisons fairness judgments between americans chinese provide evidence subtle dissimilarities
MISC--: while members two cultures similar judgments fairness health safety risk scenarios chinese subjects tend give other goals besides fairness more weight less likely consider fair option best option overall citation
MISC--: domain price fairness chinese consumers consider their own price more unfair if friend was given better price than if stranger was given better price while americans less sensitive this distinction citation
MISC--: gao number found chinese were more tolerant use market power than european cultures
MISC--: one general pattern chinese judgments fairness tend more context dependent than those americans
MISC--: extent fairness judgments influence negotiation positions disentangling role self serving bias may give hints sort interventions most effectively facilitate agreement
AIMX--: particular given importance agreement suitable plan mitigate climate change establishing whether disagreement driven self serving bias fundamental cross cultural differences what perceived fair great significance
OWNX--: using controlled experiment we attempt establish role self serving bias
OWNX--: because we cannot randomly assign individuals nationality assess effect this their fairness judgments we employ approach draws concept veil ignorance first proposed john harsanyi named john rawls citation
MISC--: veil ignorance judgment social justice fairness made people who do not know their own interests because they do not know what role they will assigned
MISC--: classic application veil ignorance indictment slavery based observation few would endorse institution if they were unaware whether they were ones who would enslaved
OWNX--: we explore how judgments fairness allocations economic sacrifices resulting reductions greenhouse gas emissions influenced placing individuals situations they aware their own national interests not
OWNX--: we presented subjects graphs displayed current projected per capita gdp income two countries farmers one scenario
MISC--: different possible divisions could altered dynamically slider was controlled subject figure number led shifts per capita income over time both parties
MISC--: subjects could move slider between one extreme placed all burdens one party other extreme placed all burdens other party until they found division sacrifice they deemed most fair
OWNX--: we randomly assigned students united states china one three scenarios varied degree they were aware their own national interests i e were behind veil ignorance
OWNX--: one scenario designed show impact self serving bias made domain climate change explicit well two countries involved china united states
MISC--: second scenario disguised countries using generic labels country country b also altered nature environmental problem so subjects would unlikely realize was about climate change
MISC--: third scenario disguised problem even further casting negotiation between two neighboring farmers
OWNX--: although scenarios differed multiple dimensions relative economic consequences shifting burdens between parties were identical all three
OWNX--: our goal this research not suggest implementing veil ignorance real climate negotiations policy recommendation though if doing so were possible we would support
OWNX--: our contribution demonstrate simple experimental procedure isolate effect self serving bias possible effects cultural differences perceptions fairness
MISC--: doing so helps us clearly establish self serving bias plays role inability parties reach agreement
MISC--: our findings also suggest interventions eliminate self serving bias international climate policy negotiations may tremendous value
