MISC--: environmental events natural disasters may influence public s affective reactions decisions
OWNX--: shortly after number tsunami disaster we assessed how affect elicited thinking about this disaster influenced risk perceptions future time perspective swedish undergraduates not directly affected disaster
OWNX--: experimental manipulation was used increase salience affect associated disaster
OWNX--: study number we found participants reminded about tsunami had sense their life was more finite included fewer opportunities than participants control condition not reminded about tsunami
OWNX--: study number we found similar effects risk perceptions
OWNX--: addition we showed manipulations ease thought influenced extent affect influenced risk perceptions greater ease thoughts being associated greater perceived risks
OWNX--: major societal events natural disasters terrorist attacks influence our thoughts feelings
MISC--: face major environmental event many people tend react emotion emotion laden decisions citation
CONT--: number east asian tsunami disaster had profound psychological impact many countries not only those were directly hit tsunami waves
MISC--: sweden pop number million had unusually high number tourists visiting area at time disaster resulting over six hundred swedes being killed missing
MISC--: tsunami disaster was therefore considered major national tragedy sweden citation
MISC--: consequence this tragedy media attention received citation was many swedes felt deeply involved saddened citation
MISC--: feelings elicited event may also impact everyday decisions
MISC--: previous research judgment decision making shown preferences constructed basis various contextual factors citation people tend rely their affective reactions when making decisions citation
MISC--: affect defined here specific quality goodness badness experienced feeling state without awareness demarcating positive negative quality stimulus
MISC--: reliance feelings judgment decision making earlier been described affect heuristic citation
MISC--: most previous research affect decision making focused integral affect citation
MISC--: however many judgments other sources affect also present
MISC--: large number studies shows affective states unrelated judgmental target influence judgments decisions nonetheless citation
MISC--: famous example johnson tversky citation found incidental affect i e mood state induced reading newspaper article influenced subsequent risk judgments
MISC--: however effect incidental affect judgments not stable unchangeable unavoidable fact should rather seen constructive process where individual tries determine if their affective reactions target reliable relevant source information citation
MISC--: at core this argument lies notion when asked make evaluative judgment individuals seek information determine how they should make this judgment
MISC--: people tend use whatever information available them at time making decision citation
MISC--: absence other relevant more salient information people use their affective reactions target evaluate object citation
MISC--: people positive moods tend evaluate objects more favorably than participants negative mood citation
MISC--: one important point here people incorrectly attribute their incidental moods reaction target
MISC--: this misattribution corrected changed introducing information questions diagnostic value affective reaction judgment
OWNX--: instance schwarz clore s citation study participants were given simple reminder about cause sunny vs cloudy weather their moods resulted mood no longer influencing judgments well being
MISC--: importantly though was diagnostic value affective reaction judgment task not affective reaction itself was affected this manipulation citation
MISC--: incidental mood only one many sources experiential information used judgments
MISC--: meta cognitive experience ease fluency information processing been shown important experiential factor informing judgments decisions citation
MISC--: study effect fluency decision making participants were more likely defer choice when they generated more reasons making choice citation
OWNX--: studies perceptual fluency subjective ease perceptual processing found if color statement printed makes easy read this impact perceived truthfulness statement citation
MISC--: thus schwarz citation notes seems subjective experiences accompany our thought processes informative their own right
MISC--: consequently meta cognitive feelings may further modulate impact affect judgments
OWNX--: supporting this study lerner gonzalez citation showed fluency manipulations influenced effect specific emotions risk perception
OWNX--: conceptual model guiding this research described following way number we expect major environmental events natural disaster may influence experienced affect even among individuals not directly affected disaster number experienced affect will turn impact various affective cognitive judgments number effects affect incidental judgment task diminished introducing information fluency manipulations questions diagnostic value experienced feelings judgments
MISC--: specifically we tested prediction affect elicited thinking about recent major natural disaster would influence judgments well being citation future pessimistic optimistic thinking citation mood congruent manner citation
MISC--: previous research documented effects laboratory induced mood using standardized mood induction procedures autobiographical recall affect inducing scenarios
OWNX--: we extended this research inducing affect through procedure participants were asked think about recent relevant major environmental disaster
OWNX--: our research strategy compared ratings affect ratings future personal societal events two groups participants one reminded about tsunami control group
OWNX--: we hypothesized reminding participants about tsunami would elicit negative affect associated event
OWNX--: we further anticipated this affect would spill over judgments well being well optimistic pessimistic thinking
CONT--: study number participants both conditions completed measure future pessimism future time perspective ftp scale lang carstensen number rated their well being citation
MISC--: ftp scale was originally developed individual difference measure perceived time remaining life citation
OWNX--: study number we used ftp scale dependent variable we expected find individuals reminded about tsunami perceived life more finite limited than participants control condition
MISC--: study number half participants tsunami remind condition were given additional experimental manipulation citation
MISC--: participants then made risk estimates various future positive negative events citation
