MISC--: people live world they surrounded potential disgust elicitors used chairs air silverware money well excretory activities
MISC--: people function this world ignoring most active avoidance reframing adaptation
MISC--: issue particularly striking professions morticians surgeons sanitation workers there frequent contact major disgust elicitors
AIMX--: this study we study adaptation process dead bodies disgust elicitors measuring specific types disgust sensitivity medical students before after they spent few months dissecting cadaver
OWNX--: using disgust scale we find significant reduction disgust responses death body envelope violation elicitors but no significant change any other specific type disgust
MISC--: there clear reduction discomfort at touching cold dead body but not touching human body still warm after death
MISC--: disgust general negative experience people seek avoid terminate citation
MISC--: however humans live disgusting world
OWNX--: air we breathe comes lungs other people chairs we sit were exposed buttocks many others our silverware was mouths many others toilet seat we use public bathroom was touched bare buttocks many unknown others money we use was handled many other people air contains molecules vaporized animal human feces most molecules water we drink were at one point other part urine some once passed through body adolph hitler
MISC--: yet humans negotiate their daily activities without much concern about disgusting entities
MISC--: they do so same way they not crippled thoughts their mortality keeping concerns background out consciousness
MISC--: this accomplished number ways number
MISC--: direct denial suppression disgusting implications number
MISC--: reframing thinking potentially disgusting things other ways number
MISC--: adaptation ceasing think many potential disgusts disgusting
MISC--: example illustrate denial most people when exiting public bathroom do not think about fact metal knob handle door they opening been touched many other unknown people some whom no doubt did not wash their hands
OWNX--: if reminded this when undesirable person front them opened door way out bathroom people might take paper towel open door
MISC--: other hand illustrate adaptation mortician who preparing his hundredth dead body burial certainly attending but ceased presumably adaptation disgusted
OWNX--: finally illustrate reframing one reduce potential disgust about swimming public pool little children no doubt urinate while swimming noting ocean itself low level urine so swimming pool just like smaller instantiation ocean
MISC--: individuals cope many potential disgust elicitors encountered normal day they may experience disgust only few times day
MISC--: this problem seems most daunting individuals whose professions bring them into contact strong disgust elicitors repeatedly morticians sanitation workers hospital orderlies surgeons example
MISC--: seems reasonable suppose two different types factors at work reducing disgust responses professions
MISC--: first individuals who generally less disgust sensitive may more likely choose professions
MISC--: second coping processes denial reframing adaptation may presumed activated become habitual prepotent
MISC--: adaptation seems like most likely candidate
OWNX--: this study we explore number
MISC--: whether adaptation occurs result extensive exposure particular class disgust elicitors number
MISC--: insofar adaptation occurs whether specific class elicitors there was exposure
OWNX--: we examine questions case first year medical students who spend number number months dissecting cadaver
