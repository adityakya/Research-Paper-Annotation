MISC--: individuals often ambiguity averse when choosing among purely chance based prospects citation
MISC--: however they often prefer apparently ambiguous ability based prospects unambiguous chance based prospects
MISC--: according competence hypothesis citation this pattern derives favorable perceptions one s competence
MISC--: most past tests competence hypothesis ambiguity confounded personal controllability source ambiguity e g chance vs missing information
OWNX--: we unconfound factors three experiments find strong evidence independent effects both ambiguity aversion competence
MISC--: experiment number participants preferred unambiguous chance based option ambiguous ability based option when ambiguity derived chance rather than uncertainty about one s own ability
MISC--: experiments number number used different operationalizations ambiguity choice contexts actual consequences participants attempted avoid both ambiguity chance insofar they could
OWNX--: findings support extend competence hypothesis demonstrating ambiguity aversion independent personal controllability source ambiguity
MISC--: folk wisdom advises better devil you know than devil you don t
MISC--: most people abide this logic when choosing between options known probabilities others ambiguous probabilities second order uncertainty
MISC--: people often choose former manifesting what decision scientists call ambiguity aversion
MISC--: classic demonstration ellsberg citation decision makers faced choice between two urns one contained number percent red number percent black marbles whereas other had unknown distribution
MISC--: selection marble specified color produced monetary prize
CONT--: participants showed no color preference but they did show clear preference number number urn
MISC--: this preference hard justify rational grounds because ambiguous urn cannot contain lower proportion both red black marbles
MISC--: later work showed people prefer unambiguous urn even when expected value other ambiguous urn higher citation they willing pay more ambiguity premium draw number number urn citation
MISC--: several persuasive explanations been offered account ambiguity aversion
MISC--: frisch baron citation proposed decision makers particularly averse missing information especially if information known manipulated others opponent may become available at some later point decision process
MISC--: authors also suggest people concerned about blame regret may follow decision made context missing information
MISC--: example parents relatively less willing vaccinate their children setting where characteristics children who experience side effects vaccination unspecified citation
MISC--: similarly heath tversky citation argue participants ellsberg paradigm mentally simulate attributions will made following selection marble consequently worry about being blamed if ambiguous urn turns out present smaller chance winning
MISC--: indeed curley yates abrams citation observed ambiguity aversion greater when contents ambiguous urn will revealed others
MISC--: important feature ellsberg paradigm contents ambiguous urn knowable just unknown participants
MISC--: outcome decision also hinges chance not any way tethered participants own knowledge abilities
MISC--: heath tversky citation suggest if people feel competent decision domain if competence related outcome they should exhibit less ambiguity aversion
MISC--: illustrative study participants predicted outcomes american football games over five week period also assessed their own knowledge about each game
MISC--: they then chose between betting team they predicted would win lottery chances winning were identical but determined chance
MISC--: long participants perceived probability winning number higher those higher perceived knowledge chose bet over lottery suggesting perceptions competence domain attenuated ambiguity aversion
MISC--: similar findings emerged contexts where voters made predictions about outcomes november number presidential election where students made predictions about future news events citation
MISC--: competence decision domain likely reduced perception missing information frisch baron posited key ambiguity aversion
OWNX--: thus heath tversky proposed perceived competence affects perceived ambiguity does not independent effect its own
MISC--: however other characteristics this decision paradigm suggest competence independent effect
MISC--: most importantly people generally prefer controllable uncontrollable outcomes citation more optimistic about outcomes controllable outcomes citation
MISC--: most though not all tests competence hypothesis unambiguous option chance determined meaning manipulation competence may confounded outcome controllability
MISC--: if probabilities skill based option were ambiguous participants might still choose skill option suggesting they prefer skill over chance enough override any opposing effect ambiguity
MISC--: controllability rather than ambiguity may also account choice betting familiar vs unfamiliar domains competence e g weather one s own geographical area vs weather distal unknown geographical area given familiarity proximity conflated controllability due magical thinking citation
MISC--: another possibility current context people responding not competence controllability per se but rather reason ambiguity
MISC--: ambiguity could different effects depending its source
MISC--: tests competence hypothesis ability based option ambiguous because not associated clearly stated probability winning there chance option
OWNX--: ambiguity instead related natural variation competence perceptions competence thereby confounding source ambiguity competence
MISC--: if ambiguity associated ability based option derived factors unrelated personal competence chance likely ability based option would become less appealing
AIMX--: above we suggested chance based options tests competence hypothesis should possess ambiguity i e range probabilities rather than point estimate here we take this one step further arguing competence based options should possess same kind ambiguity untethered competence
OWNX--: finally previous experiments offered competence options were based priori beliefs limiting way competence was conceptualized
OWNX--: no cases was competence manipulated particular giving participants feedback competence domain more directly test role competence choices involving ambiguity
OWNX--: we report three experiments systematically separate ambiguity controllability source ambiguity order determine whether people continue exhibit ambiguity aversion predicted competence hypothesis
MISC--: experiment number participants face choice between unambiguous chance based prospect ambiguous ability based prospect
MISC--: importantly latter prospect ambiguous because its difficulty determined chance
OWNX--: we predicted decision makers would prefer chance based option contrary typical pattern tests competence hypothesis but nevertheless illustrative ambiguity aversion
OWNX--: experiment number builds this study presenting participants chance option low ambiguity ability based option approximately number percent chance winning high ambiguity ability based option win probabilities ranging number percent number percent
OWNX--: because ambiguity inherent third option due chance because first option entirely chance based we expect participants prefer low ambiguity ability based option over other two demonstrating preferences controllability against ambiguity same context
OWNX--: this experiment we also give participants performance feedback upon base their choices rather than relying priori beliefs about competence
OWNX--: experiment number builds standard competence hypothesis paradigm pitting two ability based options against each other while independently manipulating level ambiguity
OWNX--: finally we ask participants make same choice someone else thereby completely separating ambiguity controllability
MISC--: if ambiguity aversion independent controllability then choices other people should mirror those self
MISC--: experiment number tests similar hypothesis using different operationalization ambiguity again unaffected personal controllability
OWNX--: this case we give participants choice among unambiguous chance based option ability based option where they must outperform low ambiguity opponent ability based option where they must instead outperform high ambiguity opponent
OWNX--: experiment number we expect people prefer ability based options but show ambiguity aversion selecting option they compete against low ambiguity opponent
MISC--: additional characteristic previous studies this literature probability winning chance based option was always unambiguous i e fixed probability
OWNX--: experiments number number we also introduce ambiguity chance based option form range probabilities
MISC--: doing so provides even more conservative test whether preference ability based tasks previous tests was due ambiguity simply preference ability based over chance based tasks
MISC--: moreover defining ambiguity terms opponent experiment number we yet again disentangled ambiguity personal competence different manner than experiment number where we ask participants make choices both themselves others
OWNX--: sum we report three experiments designed test extend competence hypothesis
MISC--: studies include both hypothetical actual choices final two experiments more than one ability based choice
MISC--: we expect people will exhibit ambiguity aversion even when controllability held constant
MISC--: they should prefer chance based options only when ability options more ambiguous but when choosing among similar ability based options they should prefer those lower ambiguity
