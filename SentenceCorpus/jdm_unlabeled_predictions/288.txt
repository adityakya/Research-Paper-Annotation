MISC--: physicians often encounter diagnostic problems ambiguous conflicting features
MISC--: what they likely do situations
MISC--: we presented diagnostic scenario number family physicians traced their information gathering diagnoses management
MISC--: scenario contained ambiguous feature while other features supported either cardiac musculoskeletal diagnosis
MISC--: due risk death cardiac diagnosis should considered managed appropriately
MISC--: forty seven participants number percent gave only musculoskeletal diagnosis number them managed patient inappropriately sent him home painkillers
MISC--: they elicited less information spent less time scenario than those who diagnosed cardiac cause
MISC--: no feedback was provided participants
MISC--: stimulated recall number physicians revealed differences way same information was interpreted function final diagnosis
CONT--: musculoskeletal group denigrated important cues making them coherent their representation pulled muscle whilst cardiac group saw them evidence cardiac problem
MISC--: most physicians indicated they were fairly very certain about their diagnosis
MISC--: observed behaviours described coherence based reasoning whereby emerging judgment influences evaluation incoming information so confident judgments achieved even ambiguous uncertain conflicting information
OWNX--: role coherence based reasoning medical diagnosis diagnostic error needs systematically examined
MISC--: diagnosis chest pain primary care notoriously difficult
MISC--: cause pain usually not life threatening
CONT--: however conditions acute coronary syndrome pulmonary embolism may fatal if unrecognised not promptly treated
MISC--: there evidence myocardial infarction mi may missed primary care citation
OWNX--: missed mi commonest cause negligence claims against primary care physicians usa relates more deaths than other conditions claims against family physicians uk citation
MISC--: epidemiological studies found atypical presentations well patients attributing their symptoms non cardiac cause significant factors missed diagnoses mi citation
OWNX--: we studied diagnosis atypical chest pain using simulated patient who attributes his pain pulled muscle
MISC--: scenario described detail later included conflicting features i e some features pointing cardiac diagnosis others pointing musculoskeletal diagnosis
MISC--: accounts coherence based reasoning describe how people deal situations what they do order resolve conflict
MISC--: faced equivocal i e non diagnostic information about two alternatives people will spontaneously form preference one alternative will distort information received subsequently so favors preferred alternative citation
MISC--: they may even distort information clearly favors one alternative order preserve earlier preference other alternative though distortion generally declines diagnosticity information increases citation
MISC--: if preferences judgments change result new incoming information distortion continues operate now favor new preference judgment citation
MISC--: seems distortion information psychological necessity helps individuals form maintain coherent judgments
MISC--: parallels medical diagnosis drawn studies legal decision making
MISC--: simon colleagues gave participants legal case conflicting information i e where each position was supported equal amounts probabilistic evidence asked them render verdict indicate their confidence citation
MISC--: they pre disposed participants either guilt verdict innocence verdict presenting them dna evidence either incriminated exonerated defendant odds number number million dna evidence being wrong
OWNX--: before seeing case participants had been asked rate diagnosticity each piece evidence presented them unrelated vignettes describing various social situations
OWNX--: after they read rendered their verdict legal case participants were asked rate diagnosticity each piece evidence again this time presented them context case
MISC--: new ratings were consistent verdict significantly differed ones made earlier unrelated vignettes
MISC--: seems whilst evidence was initially perceived truly equivocal non diagnostic was subsequently contextualised became part mental model legal case
MISC--: its perceived diagnosticity thus increased line verdict
MISC--: authors argue dna match should bear no relationship other pieces evidence case reliability eyewitness identification
OWNX--: nevertherless now perceived related their evaluation shifts support final verdict what authors call coherence shifts
MISC--: this basic experimental procedure been repeated several variations order test whether different factors affected coherence based reasoning
OWNX--: coherence shifts were found even when participants were asked simply memorise ambiguous legal case
MISC--: when they were unexpectedly asked render verdict rate their agreement various arguments case agreement had shifted baseline function final verdict citation
OWNX--: largest shifts however were observed between baseline interim phase after memorisation but before being asked render verdict indicate leaning towards verdict
MISC--: findings suggest coherence shifts happen pre decisionally not simply result decision justification
MISC--: processing complex legal case contained conflicting arguments intention either make decision later receive further information memorise order communicate someone else resulted comparable coherence shifts citation
OWNX--: this was attributed intense attempt comprehend complex material represent mentally coherent way
MISC--: pre decisional distortion information been investigated mostly college students tasks required no prior experience technical skill
MISC--: professionals people experience specific domain making judgments within their domain expertise rarely studied
MISC--: one study participants experienced horse race betting evaluated task related information chances horses winning simulated race accordance their final choice either anticipation having place bet later consequence simply processing task information
MISC--: they distorted information greater extent than participants without experience betting horses citation
MISC--: we wanted investigate how physicians deal difficult diagnostic problems contain conflicting information where diagnoses cannot confirmed excluded certainty
MISC--: diagnosis chest pain primary care lends itself this type enquiry
AIMX--: chest pain scenario was one seven scenarios we built larger study investigated relationship between experience information search diagnostic accuracy difficult problems family medicine citation
OWNX--: we found across scenarios experience was not related diagnostic accuracy was predicted only number critical cues elicited i e cues diagnostic value relevant differential diagnoses
