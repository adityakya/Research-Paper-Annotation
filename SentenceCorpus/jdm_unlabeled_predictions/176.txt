MISC--: judging near distant virtue vice
MISC--: journal experimental social psychology number number number explored how psychological distance influences moral judgment found more extreme moral appraisals were given distal behaviors rather than proximal behaviors
OWNX--: contrary eyal et al current paper presents converging evidence showing moral judgments become more extreme at lower level construals compared higher level construals
OWNX--: four experiments using two different priming techniques we manipulated construal levels assessed their effects moral judgment
OWNX--: high level consturals elicited less moral outrage toward transgressions less positive ratings virtuous behaviors than low level construals
MISC--: replication study was also conducted reconcile inconsistencies between current results those eyal et al possible explanations different results between two studies discussed
OWNX--: preference judgment commonly influenced information we attend receive construct
OWNX--: we construe same event different ways
OWNX--: when attending object we focus its entire figure we focus its details
MISC--: recent work construal level theory clt provides framework considerable potential linking mental representations moral judgment
OWNX--: clt proposes same event object represented at multiple levels abstraction citation
OWNX--: high level construals superordinate decontextualized entail constructing abstract conceptualizations information about objects events
OWNX--: contrast low level construals consist subordinate contextualized information represented concretely detail
OWNX--: individuals judgments decisions behaviors differ function construal levels
OWNX--: more weight given global abstract features at high level construals whereas local concrete features more influential at low level construals
MISC--: clt received great deal attention psychology its predictions been applied many aspects human cognition behavior citation
OWNX--: example activation high level construals leads categorization fewer broader abstract units whereas activation low levels leads categorization multiple narrow concrete units citation
OWNX--: high level representations also more coherent integrative whereas low level representations more specific disparate citation
MISC--: according clt psychological distance major determinant what level construal activated
OWNX--: general distancing target any dimension psychological distance i e time space social hypotheticality leads greater activation high level construals than low level construals citation
MISC--: instance fujita colleagues citation found subjects were more likely describe spatially distant events terms goals high level than terms means low level
MISC--: under framework clt eyal et al citation investigated how psychological distance affects moral judgment
OWNX--: paper they argued moral principles high level constructs because their abstract universal nature concrete situational detail should mitigate moral judgment
MISC--: since clt posits more psychologically distant entities represented at higher level construals eyal et al proposed people would more inclined base their judgments remote behaviors moral principles but underweight situational details thereby leading more extreme moral judgments distal transgressions relative proximal transgressions
MISC--: consider instance act sexual intercourse between siblings
MISC--: distant perspective one tends construe incest without considering mitigating details e g using contraceptives might tilt moral judgment less extreme
OWNX--: therefore eyal et al predicted observed greater psychological distances were associated more extreme moral judgments
MISC--: current project tried build eyal et al findings started conceptual replication more directly manipulating construal levels
MISC--: clt indicates findings effect psychological distance people s judgment decision making should not unique effect psychological distance per se but rather more general process mental representations influence nature evaluative objects decisions
OWNX--: considering eyal et al studies manipulated psychological distances did not test proposed effects construal levels we first used more direct manipulation construal levels manipulation employed other clt research investigate how levels construal affect moral judgment
OWNX--: we however observed low level construals led more negative judgment moral transgressions contrary eyal et al s findings interpretation
OWNX--: order establish robustness our findings we conducted another three experiments using different manipulations construal levels varied scenarios
OWNX--: consistent initial findings converging results suggest moral judgments more extreme at lower level construals than higher level construals
OWNX--: given our results opposite those eyal et al we established partial collaboration tal eyal attempting understand basis our differing pattern findings
OWNX--: we conducted replication study study number present paper still observed results contrary those eyal et al tal eyal also tried replicate two our experiments israeli subjects partial results were direction replicating our findings but not statistically reliable
