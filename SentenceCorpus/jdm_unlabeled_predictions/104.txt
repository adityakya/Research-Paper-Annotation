MISC--: participants drank either regular root beer sugar free diet root beer before working probability learning task they tried predict two events would occur each number trials
MISC--: one event e number randomly occurred number trials other e number number
MISC--: each last two blocks number trials regular group matched prediction event frequencies
MISC--: contrast diet group predicted e number more often each blocks
OWNX--: after task participants were asked write down rules they used responding
MISC--: blind ratings rule complexity were inversely related e number predictions final number trials
OWNX--: participants also took longer advance after incorrect predictions before predicting e number reflecting time revising consulting rules
OWNX--: results support hypothesis effortful controlled process normative rule generation produces matching probability learning experiments this process function glucose availability
MISC--: two choice probability learning pl experiments one event e number better chance occurring than other e number event likelihoods independent responses
MISC--: participant s task predict event will occur each trial
MISC--: although participants could maximize hits exclusively predicting e number they tend approximately match prediction frequencies outcome probabilities many trials citation
MISC--: example if e number occurs number percent trials e number occurs other number percent trials people usually predict e number about number percent their choices hundreds trials citation
CONT--: this probability matching pm behavior suboptimal because produces hits only number percent trials number x number number x number instead maximal number percent hit rate always predicting e number
