OWNX--: this paper we investigate claim decisions experience features lotteries learned through sampling process differ decisions description features lotteries explicitly described
OWNX--: we find experience description gap not robust been previously assumed
MISC--: we argue when this gap appears driven large extent asymmetries information concerning events possible certain
OWNX--: first we find when experience based decision makers sample events without error then told what outcomes associated each possible event they risk seeking low probability gains risk averse high probability gains description based decision making
MISC--: second we find experience description gap low probability outcomes appears when rare outcomes never experienced but disappears when number all distinct outcomes experienced at least once number never experienced outcomes described possibilities
AIMX--: third we find experience description gap high probability outcomes pronounced when decision makers previously experience lotteries both offered possibility zero outcome presumably makes them doubt always experienced outcome certain but disappears when they not previously experienced lotteries
MISC--: major thrust behavioral decision research been identify situations people act boldly timidly face risk uncertainty
MISC--: studies decision under risk people choose between chance gambles known probabilities outcomes e g receive number probability number versus number sure
MISC--: studies found people typically exhibit fourfold pattern risk attitudes seeking risk low probability gains high probability losses e g most prefer number chance number over number sure avoiding risk high probability gains low probability losses e g most prefer number sure over number chance number predicted prospect theory citation
MISC--: studies decision under uncertainty participants choose between prospects contingent natural events e g receive number if home team wins versus number sure
MISC--: studies don t generally lend themselves analysis risk attitudes because they rely singular natural events there no objective probabilities
MISC--: however when analyzed relative judged probabilities several studies reveal similar pattern risk preferences citation
MISC--: many decisions potential outcomes not known advance but must learned experience
OWNX--: instance commuter might choose preferred route work only after sampling alternative routes several occasions
MISC--: influential paper hertwig barron weber erev citation modeled situations asking participants learn about pair lotteries e g gain number points probability number gain number otherwise b gain number points sure sampling outcomes replacement many times they wished unlabeled buttons associated payoff distributions see table number list all lottery pairs
OWNX--: after this sampling phase participants chose lottery play once real money
MISC--: experience based decision making henceforth ebdm appears reverse fourfold pattern risk attitudes description based decision making henceforth dbdm people avoiding risk low probability gains high probability losses seeking risk high probability gains low probability losses citation
MISC--: basis results authors called two different theories risky choice hbwe p number
MISC--: generalization ebdm differs dbdm difficult evaluate because surprisingly no one yet defined experience based decision making
MISC--: our reading literature correspondence several major contributors we conclude authors referring single decision number decision makers knowledge possible outcomes respective probabilities incomplete number this information derived at least part sampling process
MISC--: according this definition ebdm applies any situation there uncertainty learning through sampling
MISC--: however most data supporting putative experience description gap contrast single dbdm paradigm decision under risk minor variations single ebdm paradigm hbwe design
MISC--: note decision under risk hbwe paradigm vary not only terms how information learned explicit description versus sequential sampling but also what information available decision makers i e information sampled experience may diverge information describing corresponding objective probability distribution over outcomes
MISC--: according information asymmetry hypothesis experience description gap driven differences information available decision makers will diminish disappear when differences eliminated
AIMX--: purpose this paper test information asymmetry hypothesis better circumscribe conditions under decisions experience differ decisions description
