MISC--: three studies presented scenarios lay people investigate their willingness restrict imports
MISC--: greater restriction was preferred when similar goods were made at home when owners foreign businesses made very good profits less consistently when goods came low wage country
OWNX--: particular reluctance import low wage country did not vary whether home firm was likely lose business level understanding comparative advantage but was related profits made foreign business owners
MISC--: results show lay people views based concern people other countries well their own
MISC--: do people particular reluctance their country importing goods low wage countries
OWNX--: if so what might basis this reluctance
MISC--: both questions been raised within field international economics citation but not my knowledge been subject empirical investigation
AIMX--: this paper investigates them
MISC--: set issue context worth first noting lay people generally not convinced benefits free international trade recent survey results indicate majority people many western countries would prefer see more rather than fewer restrictions imports than exist at present citation
MISC--: this respect general public at odds economics profession samples produced substantial majorities favour freeing up trade citation
CONT--: difference views may well go back nineteenth century there been several suggestions why difference might arise citation
AIMX--: focus present paper narrower do people developed countries particularly dislike importing goods countries low wages low labour costs
MISC--: if so why
OWNX--: before reviewing some reasons why people might not want import low wage countries worthwhile note there at least two reasons expecting precisely opposite result
MISC--: firstly most obviously goods countries likely cheaper
MISC--: taking strictly selfish perspective vast majority people benefit being able buy example shirts dairy products cars cheaper but comparable quality those made one s own country
MISC--: secondly taking more utilitarian perspective poorly paid workers foreign country could seen more need one s custom than higher paid workers at home rich foreign country
MISC--: other hand there several possible reasons why people might oppose importing low wage countries
MISC--: three reasons investigated here people fear business job losses result local higher wage workers having compete low wage workers dislike stems failure understand ricardo s principle comparative advantage people fear low paid foreign workers being exploited
MISC--: three reasons were investigated because they related three misconceptions about comparative advantage discussed krugman obstfeld citation
OWNX--: fourth reason people believe goods imported low wage countries might lower quality was not investigated but instead effects belief were controlled studies follow
OWNX--: perhaps most obvious reason resist importing foreign low wage countries fear one s compatriots perhaps even oneself might lose their businesses livelihoods result this competition
MISC--: this no means unreasonable fear
MISC--: although one debate precisely how much unemployment arises this cause rather than technological advance there no doubt people lose their jobs their businesses
MISC--: also well known losses enduring serious consequences people s well being citation
MISC--: moreover there already good empirical evidence people s opposition importing goods increases if similar goods available producers one s own country if consequences employment at home pointed out although this previous research not investigated effect wage levels country supplying imports citation
MISC--: important note this opposition arises not only those whose livelihoods businesses personally affected but also others who concerned welfare producers workers their own country
MISC--: concern could considered altruism one s compatriots parochialism connects body previous research investigating situations individuals may act interests group but not their own interests those wider out group citation
MISC--: nonetheless although previous work leads us expect opposition imports compete home businesses not clear should particularly matter if imports originate low wage country rather than one pays higher wages but still produce goods more cheaply
MISC--: one most important economic arguments greater welfare results freer trade derives ricardo s citation principle comparative advantage
MISC--: very briefly principle suggests where goods should most efficiently produced depends ratio costs production comparative advantage rather than absolute costs absolute advantage
CONT--: corollary country need not most efficient producer any commodity order benefit trade
MISC--: krugman citation points out some people might generally hostile trade because they misunderstand economic arguments ricardo s principle comparative advantage
MISC--: ricardo s principle neither trivial nor obvious citation baron kemp citation found both principle was poorly understood lay people people lower understanding tended more protectionist outlook
MISC--: krugman obstfeld citation suggest common myth free trade beneficial only if your country strong enough stand up competition arises because this misunderstanding
MISC--: authors go point out principle important because country does not absolute advantage producing good over some other country might still comparative advantage
OWNX--: this comes about because country s overall lower productivity then reflected lower wages enabling sell good lower cost other country
MISC--: however because lower cost linked lower wages importing goods might seen unfair people other country
MISC--: finally possible people might oppose imports countries low labour costs because they believe workers countries exploited profiteering business owners who pay low wages citation
OWNX--: this case opposition would arise altruistic motives behalf foreign workers
MISC--: course whether not exploited foreign workers really benefit altruistic protectionism debateable
MISC--: krugman obstfeld citation point out what alternative
OWNX--: three scenario studies investigating issues reported below
MISC--: first two studies feature research designs three different components factors scenarios systematically varied
OWNX--: three factors whether goods under consideration importation come low high wage country whether similar goods already made at home home businesses might suffer competition level profit made owners foreign businesses
OWNX--: after reading each scenario respondents asked their preferences about restricting imports
MISC--: obviously interesting know whether restriction preference varies other country s wages but interactive effects also important evaluating why preference might arise
MISC--: if there particularly strong preference restricting imports when similar goods made at home imported goods come low wage country this strong indication resistance importing low wage country related fear competition unemployment at home
MISC--: similarly if people want restrict imports low wage country because they fear exploitation we would expect resistance importing country where business owners make very large profits stronger when imports come low wage country
MISC--: study number used somewhat different method examine relationship between people s restriction preference test their understanding principle comparative advantage citation
OWNX--: first third studies employed small samples new zealand second small sample eastern germany
