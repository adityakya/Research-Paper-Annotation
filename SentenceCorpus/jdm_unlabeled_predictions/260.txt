MISC--: distinction proposed between recommending preferred choice options recommending against non preferred choice options
MISC--: binary choice both recommendation modes logically though not psychologically equivalent
OWNX--: we report empirical evidence showing speakers recommending preferred options predominantly select positive frames less common when speakers recommend against non preferred options
MISC--: addition option attractiveness shown affect speakers choice frame adoption recommendation mode
CONT--: results interpreted terms three compatibility effects i recommendation mode valence framing compatibility speakers preference positive framing enhanced under recommending diminished under recommending against instructions ii option attractiveness valence framing compatibility speakers preference positive framing more pronounced attractive than unattractive options iii recommendation mode option attractiveness compatibility speakers more likely adopt recommending approach attractive than unattractive binary choice pairs
MISC--: framing effects been much debated ever since tversky kahneman citation showed preference risk dependent choice alternatives being framed either positive negative terms
MISC--: evidently choice behavior determined not only inherent value alternative options but also way they described
MISC--: early framing studies exposed participants vignettes contained text fragments recorded decision makers corresponding choices
MISC--: little attention was paid studies source message
CONT--: reality however message transferred source e g speaker target e g listener
MISC--: indeed analysis speakers listeners perspective central conversational analysis human judgment citation constitutes essence grice s logic conversation relevance theory
MISC--: social context decision making therefore crucial when studying framing
OWNX--: understanding pragmatics framing requires not only study decision makers responses alternative frames but also examination speakers construction preference among various possible frames
AIMX--: present paper constitutes continuation our previous research citation employing conversational framework persuasive efficacy speakers listeners was examined
BASE--: specifically previous research we analyzed risky choice framing citation shown speakers who try persuade listener adopt particular choice alternative possess distinct preference positive over negative framing
CONT--: judged listeners responses however inclination use positive frames effective promoting riskless but not risky options
OWNX--: we demonstrated empirically incompatibility between speakers listeners was due asymmetry evaluation mode citation between speakers listeners
MISC--: speakers jointly i e comparatively assess information persuasive qualities alternative frames
MISC--: contrast listeners exposed only one frames consequently assess information only separately i e non comparatively
OWNX--: our earlier research we studied frame valence positive vs negative preferences speakers their effectiveness persuading listeners
OWNX--: specifically we examined compatibility between speakers listeners terms frame preferences
AIMX--: present study we explore closely related issue valence framing namely manner option recommended
OWNX--: distinction proposed between two general persuasive orientations speakers might adopt recommending preferred choice alternatives recommending against non preferred choice alternatives
MISC--: this distinction referred recommendation mode
OWNX--: broadly speaking recommending entail drawing attention listing desired attributes thus forming positive orientation
OWNX--: contrast recommending against requires attending unwanted aspects thus forming negative orientation
OWNX--: note present context positive negative orientations should interpreted not just absolute but also relative terms
OWNX--: thus example saying item cheaper than item b implies positive recommendation
