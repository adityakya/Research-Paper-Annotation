MISC--: goal obtaining information improve classification accuracy strongly conflict goal obtaining information improving payoffs
OWNX--: two environments conflict were identified through computer optimization
MISC--: three subsequent experiments investigated people s search behavior environments
OWNX--: experiments number number used multiple cue probabilistic category learning task convey environmental probabilities
MISC--: subsequent search task subjects could query only single feature before making classification decision
MISC--: crucial manipulation concerned search task reward structure
MISC--: payoffs corresponded either accuracy equal rewards associated two categories asymmetric payoff function different rewards associated each category
MISC--: experiment number learning task feedback corresponded true category people later preferentially searched accuracy maximizing feature whether not this would improve monetary rewards
MISC--: experiment number asymmetric reward structure was used during learning
OWNX--: subjects searched reward maximizing feature when asymmetric payoffs were preserved search task
MISC--: however if search task payoffs corresponded accuracy subjects preferentially searched feature was suboptimal reward accuracy alike
MISC--: importantly this feature would been most useful under learning task payoff structure
OWNX--: experiment number found if words numbers used convey environmental probabilities neither reward nor accuracy consistently predicts search
MISC--: findings emphasize necessity taking into account people s goals search decision processes during learning thereby challenging current models information search
MISC--: when diagnosing treating patient when choosing job candidate mate many other situations one must make decisions without having all relevant information
MISC--: there widely applicable strategies identifying useful queries
MISC--: what governs people s information search
MISC--: information acquisition situations where no particular benefits costs apply statistical optimal experimental design oed models provide one framework evaluating value alternative queries citation
MISC--: variety experiments suggest models also provide reasonable description human information search behavior citation situations no explicit external payoffs
MISC--: but many situations instance when deciding whether something safe eat whether suspicious suitcase contains bomb whether patient should sent cardiac care unit strong asymmetries consequences particular correct incorrect decisions apply
MISC--: asymmetries implications classification decisions
MISC--: instance potential cardiac patient should sent cardiac care unit if risk heart attack greater than some threshold
MISC--: threshold should clearly less than number percent chance heart attack would threshold maximizing overall classification accuracy
MISC--: there implications information search varying benefits costs different kinds correct incorrect decisions
MISC--: intuitively may seem best strategy conduct queries allow determination true state nature accurately possible take payoffs into account only actual classification decision
MISC--: intuition distinctly wrong
MISC--: our theoretical analyses simulations illustrate situation specific costs benefits must considered when determining information acquire test conduct question ask query make not only when making classification decisions
MISC--: other words many highly informative tests useless given applicable situation specific reward structures
MISC--: what extent does people s information search behavior appropriately reflect costs benefits associated different correct mistaken decisions
OWNX--: we address this three experiments using probabilistic multiple cue category learning information search paradigm
OWNX--: importantly we identify investigate situations goal obtaining information helps maximize number correct classification decisions should principle lead different search behavior than appropriate maximize reward given particular environment s reward structure
MISC--: environmental reward structure consists payoffs each kind correct classification decision costs each kind incorrect classification decision
MISC--: we examine whether people s information search behavior appropriately reflects situation specific reward structures whether people may use probability gain citation guide their search decisions even when not adaptive do so
