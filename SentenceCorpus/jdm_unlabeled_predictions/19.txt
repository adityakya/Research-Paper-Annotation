MISC--: i show how coherence correspondence distinction inform conversation about decision methods engineering design
MISC--: some engineers argue application multi attribute utility theory while others argue what they call heuristics
OWNX--: clarify differences among methods i first ask whether each method aims at achieving coherence correspondence
MISC--: analyzing statements design literature i argue utility theory aims at achieving coherence heuristics aim at achieving correspondence
MISC--: second i ask if achieving coherence always implies achieving correspondence
CONT--: important provide answer because while design objective correspondence difficult assess coherence easier assess used surrogate
MISC--: i argue coherence does not always imply correspondence design this also case problems studied judgment decision making research
MISC--: uncovering conditions under coherence implies does not imply correspondence topic where engineering design judgment decision making research might connect
MISC--: kenneth hammond citation pointed out method evaluated both according its internal consistency coherence its external performance correspondence
MISC--: important keep this distinction mind when comparing decision methods because one method could achieving coherence while another method could achieving correspondence
MISC--: example take best heuristic citation violates criterion coherence transitivity satisfied linear regression while under some conditions take best outperforms regression criterion correspondence predictive accuracy
AIMX--: this article i show how coherence correspondence distinction inform conversation about decision methods within field had minimal overlap jdm judgment decision making field engineering design
MISC--: number national science foundation nsf engineering design program director george hazelrigg wrote increasingly recognized engineering design decision intensive process p number
MISC--: nsf since number sponsored numerous workshops decision based design
MISC--: accreditation board engineering technology also defines engineering design decision making process
OWNX--: what decisions do design engineers make
MISC--: design engineers choose among alternative concepts
OWNX--: design concept technical specification artifact detailed enough so engineer predict reasonably accurately how artifact will function
MISC--: example concept chair would specify material used build each chair part geometrical relationships among parts
MISC--: there typically many attributes design concepts evaluated
MISC--: examples attributes chair concept durability comfort production cost
MISC--: hereafter i refer design concepts simply designs
MISC--: some engineers citation argue application multi attribute utility theory choosing among designs while others argue what they call heuristics stuart pugh s convergence process citation
MISC--: this debate large ignored coherence correspondence distinction
MISC--: i ask two questions use distinction inform debate
OWNX--: first question whether each method aims at achieving coherence correspondence both
MISC--: analyzing published statements design literature i argue multi attribute utility theory aims at achieving coherence while pugh convergence process aims at achieving correspondence
MISC--: second question if achieving coherence always implies achieving correspondence
CONT--: important answer because while design objective decision making correspondence difficult assess coherence easier assess used surrogate
MISC--: surrogate coherence useful inferring objective correspondence relationship between two must known
OWNX--: i argue coherence does not always imply correspondence design this also case decision problems studied jdm
OWNX--: i conclude study conditions under coherence implies does not imply correspondence topic where design jdm research might connect
MISC--: before asking answering two questions i review two methods making decisions prominent place engineering design theory practice
