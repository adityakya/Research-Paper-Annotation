MISC--: although theories economics evolutionary biology predict one s age health survival probability should associated one s subjective discount rate sdr few studies empirically tested links
OWNX--: our study analyzes detail how sdr related age health survival probability surveying sample individuals townships around durban south africa
OWNX--: contrast previous studies we find age not significantly related sdr but both physical health survival expectations u shaped relationship sdr
MISC--: individuals very poor health high discount rates those very good health also high discount rates
MISC--: similarly those expected survival probability extremes high discount rates
MISC--: therefore health survival probability not age seem predictors one s sdr area world high morbidity mortality
MISC--: people generally prefer receive reward sooner rather than later
MISC--: present value future reward often discounted when there delay receiving reward
MISC--: many terms used describe this phenomenon time preference positive rate intertemporal substitution impatience impulsivity
OWNX--: delay discounting will used this paper refer phenomenon individual discounts value reward received future relative receiving reward immediately degree individual discounts future reward will measured subjective discount rate sdr we define formally below
MISC--: although delay discounting common assumption models intertemporal choice literature relatively incomplete when comes why people discount future general why some people discount more than others
OWNX--: among various factors associated delay discounting proposed literature we review detail next section theory background age emerged one key factor
MISC--: although existing theoretical models delay discounting often explicitly specify mortality risk reduces opportunity consumption future morbidity risk reduces utility consumption future determinants delay discounting most existing empirical tests theoretical models rely mostly age proxy those risks
MISC--: distinction between age mortality morbidity may important
MISC--: if determinants sdr known if determinants changed many potentially bad outcomes related impatience could theory prevented if willingness wait some future reward could enhanced
MISC--: while one s age not changeable one s mortality morbidity risks changed either through investment one s own health capital through public health interventions
MISC--: if mortality morbidity risks causally related one s sdr changes risks potentially lead changes one s sdr
OWNX--: our study complements existing literature adding health survival probability addition age empirical specifications
