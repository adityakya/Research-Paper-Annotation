MISC--: three experiments investigated individuals preferences affective reactions negative life experiences
MISC--: participants had more intense negative affective reaction when they were exposed highly negative life experience than when they were exposed two negative events highly negative mildly negative life event
OWNX--: participants also chose situation containing two versus one negative event
OWNX--: thus more negative events were better when events had different affective intensities
MISC--: when participants were exposed events having similar affective intensities however two negative events produced more intense negative affective reaction
MISC--: addition participants chose situation having one versus two negative life experiences
OWNX--: thus more negative events were worse when events had similar affective intensities
MISC--: results consistent averaging summation s model delineate situations when more negative life events better when more negative life events worse
MISC--: results also ruled out several alternative interpretations including peak end rule mental accounting interpretations
MISC--: more worse when comes negative life events
OWNX--: this conclusion follows behavioral approaches
MISC--: behavioral accounts addition negatively valenced stimulus already negatively valenced context should reduce approach preference tendencies citation
MISC--: averaging summation s model citation demonstrated individuals feelings preferences sometimes but not always sum affective values associated each event example individuals may not always feel more negative after experiencing compound event containing both highly negative plus mildly negative event than they feel after experiencing singular highly negative one
MISC--: model incorporates findings judgment social influence literatures citation
OWNX--: averaging example was found judgment literature when individuals were given traits cues had discrepant values see however our discussion set size effects section number number whereas summation each individual s impact was seen social influence audience literatures citation where participants typically performed task front spectators having similar impact ratings similar status levels
MISC--: s model averaging effects not relegated judgment domain summation effects not relegated social influence domain
MISC--: rather individuals responses reflect sensitivity sum values associated each event well central seeking tendencies average value events
MISC--: see appendix quantitative expression this model
OWNX--: this model was initially developed provide theoretical account how individuals respond simultaneous presence one multiple audience members having heterogeneous homogeneous status levels citation
