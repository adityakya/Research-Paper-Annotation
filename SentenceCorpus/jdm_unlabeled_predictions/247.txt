MISC--: using brunswik s citation lens model framework hammond citation proposed interpersonal conflict theory explain nature source resolution disagreement cognitive conflict between parties performing judgment tasks
MISC--: early review brehmer citation highlighted potential this approach example understanding structure cognitive conflicts effect task person variables judgment policy change conflict resolution
CONT--: however our bibliographic content reviews number present day demonstrate research cognitive conflict using lens model declined sharply while research task conflict grown dramatically
MISC--: there also been shift less theoretical precision methodological rigor
OWNX--: we discuss possible reasons developments suggest ways lens model research cognitive conflict revitalized borrowing recent theoretical methodological advances field judgment decision making
MISC--: was during cognitive revolution psychology cold war period political history when hammond citation proposed conflicts between parties performing judgment tasks could viewed purely cognitive thus making unnecessary examine motivations values conflicting parties social psychologists might do
MISC--: interpersonal conflict ipc theory hammond citation outlined how this cognitive conflict could construed within brunswik s citation lens model framework well experimental methods researchers could use study nature source resolution disagreement between parties performing judgment tasks
MISC--: briefly cognitive conflict represents differences how parties conceptualize solution problem
MISC--: instance different parties may different policies solving judgment problem terms information they rely
MISC--: inconsistency how parties apply their judgment policies also lead disagreement
MISC--: thus according ipc theory parties striving make joint judgment same task could conflict because they disagree principle they different policies how solve problem practice they inconsistent application their policies
MISC--: importantly while cognitive conflict different conflict caused motivational value differences among parties cognitive differences evolve into motivational value laden conflicts
MISC--: under circumstances underlying cognitive differences very difficult detect resolve
CONT--: early review research using ipc theory published psychological bulletin brehmer citation highlighted potential this approach advancing our understanding cognitive conflict both laboratory real world settings
MISC--: despite this since time ipc theory appears featured little growing field judgment decision making jdm
MISC--: example historical review theories field goldstein hogarth citation provide only passing mention ipc theory when considering developments judgment research
MISC--: need conflict theories including cognitive conflict seems apparent era characterized international terrorism where amongst other things parties disagree about level threat how manage minimize citation era characterized movement towards greater use alternative dispute resolution
MISC--: fact today theory cognitive conflict could benefit recent theoretical methodological advances field jdm
MISC--: instance jdm researchers shown individuals likely use simple process models when performing judgment tasks citation non cognitive factors emotions may affect how individuals make judgments citation
MISC--: addition researchers employed new tools virtual environments computer simulations when studying judgment behavior citation
OWNX--: our goal evaluate evolution ipc theory its inception present day
OWNX--: specifically we consider how research cognitive conflict developed terms its theoretical underpinnings methodological stance we review findings empirical research cognitive conflict
OWNX--: our goal modest we focus our efforts cognitive conflict directly emerged ipc paradigm related lens model framework
AIMX--: review conflict theories research more generally not within scope present paper
OWNX--: article organized into three main parts
MISC--: first we consider emergence ipc theory citation citation outlining its roots brunswikian psychology experimental methodology employed early research findings
BASE--: second number present day we trace evolution ipc theory cognitive conflict research conducting bibliographic content reviews publications cite central articles hammond number brehmer number
OWNX--: finally we discuss future ipc theory cognitive conflict research considering opportunities theoretical advancement methodological innovation offered currently field jdm
OWNX--: we hope will inspire future researchers
