MISC--: variety spice life
MISC--: present research suggests answer depends rate consumption
AIMX--: three experiments we find whereas variety stimuli preferred repetition even better liked single stimulus when consumption continuous this preference reverses when satiation associated repetition reduced slowing down rate consumption
MISC--: decision makers however seem under appreciate influence consumption rate preference satisfaction variety
MISC--: at high rates consumption they correctly anticipate their own high desire variety but at low rates consumption people tend overestimate their own desire variety
MISC--: results complicate picture presented prior research diversification bias suggesting people overestimate their own desire variety only when consumption spaced out over time
MISC--: dictum variety spice life notwithstanding people seem show surprising tolerance even preference repetition
MISC--: whether favorite snack pop song piece art people routinely expose themselves same liked stimulus repeatedly
MISC--: indeed prior work shown people even surprise themselves this preference research diversification bias consistently shown people predict greater preference variety aversion repetition than they show their online immediate preferences citation
MISC--: example when shopping week s supply yogurt person might supplement his her favorite flavor say strawberry one more less preferred alternatives say vanilla only find surplus less preferred flavor at end week citation
MISC--: this apparent tolerance repetition conflicts not only people s own intuitions but surface at least existing models taste satiation
MISC--: central tenet most psychological economic theories taste enjoyment enjoyable stimuli declines repetition citation
MISC--: if people repeatedly consume product thought they become satiated enjoyment decreases
MISC--: indeed one illustrative study participants listened number second sample favorite song number times quick succession rating their enjoyment experience along way
MISC--: what began enjoyable experience became decidedly less so after only number iteration citation
MISC--: how seeming inconsistencies revealed preference repetition shown studies diversification bias aversion repetition shown studies like above reconciled
MISC--: one key discrepancy may lie inter consumption interval time between acts consumption
OWNX--: whereas studies demonstrate preference repetition tend involve brief episodes consumption relatively long day week inter consumption interval song study just described involved more prolonged consumption experience no breaks between individual acts consumption
MISC--: this difference likely critical importance light inherently fleeting nature satiation
MISC--: although people do satiate given stimulus satiation tends relatively short lived citation
MISC--: time people s preferences typically return their pre consumption level
CONT--: just muscle citation weakens short term through repeated use but replenishes over time satiation seems same property
MISC--: whereas same snack pop song grows tiresome if repeated quick succession drop off enjoyment may much smaller even non existent if there sufficient gap between consumption intervals
MISC--: if rate consumption influences desirability repetition logically follows should influence desirability its logical complement variety well
MISC--: people aware influence rate consumption satiation
MISC--: informal observation suggests they
MISC--: most us realize same favorite food would quickly grow tiresome if served appetizer entree dessert at same sitting whereas those same three servings would perfectly palatable if spread out over month
MISC--: yet research seems show people consistently underestimate their liking repetition overestimate their liking its complement variety at least when consumption spaced citation
MISC--: why
MISC--: one reason time contraction citation
MISC--: people tend underweight importance time when predicting their preferences novelty liking repetition imagining lengthy intervals if they were short ones
MISC--: when predicting their snack preferences over course week instance people think about how unappetizing same food item would if consumed rapid succession forgetting time tends reset one s preferences
MISC--: consistent time contraction read loewenstein citation showed merely drawing people s attention otherwise neglected inter consumption interval decreased predicted this instance inaccurate preference variety
CONT--: note however time contraction explanation this unwarranted preference applies only lengthy inter consumption intervals
MISC--: extent people underestimate their liking repetition because they imagine short inter consumption interval those predictions should more calibrated when inter consumption interval fact short
MISC--: other words inter consumption interval decreases predicted preference variety should align experience thus actual preferences
MISC--: straightforward prediction naturally follows this hypothesis concerning people s satisfaction choices they make advance
MISC--: already mentioned prior work diversification bias consistently shown people choose greater variety when deciding future consumption than when deciding moment
MISC--: should come no surprise then people sometimes dissatisfied degree variety they select prospectively citation
OWNX--: however if our thesis correct then this miswanting citation also likely vary function inter consumption interval
MISC--: specifically inter consumption interval decreases satisfaction choices made advance should increase
MISC--: present research was designed test hypotheses
MISC--: experiment number explores whether enjoyment repetition aversion variety increases inter consumption interval increases
MISC--: experiment number examines whether tendency choose more variety prospect than moment diversification bias decreases inter consumption interval decreases
MISC--: experiment number also examines whether this causes people more satisfied consumption choices they make advance inter consumption interval decreases
MISC--: experiment number extends results varying length inter consumption interval observing nature relationship between this interval preference variety subsequent enjoyment
