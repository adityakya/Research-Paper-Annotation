AIMX--: this paper i explore how evolution emotional expression co operative planning humans may inform way they communicate about risks what implication this may models rationality risk communication
MISC--: particular i focus aspects human language enable successful co ordination around shared tasks involve management uncertainty group
MISC--: i distinguish between performative action oriented constative description oriented aspects human communication argue human logical vocabulary conditionals quantifiers probability expressions often conveys pragmatic signals implicitly encourage discourage course action under discussion
AIMX--: i review some studies illustrate this perspective highlighting role emotional undertone risk communication management show how differs existing models risk communication decision making
AIMX--: this paper i will take view primary function communication excite inhibit behaviours others only secondarily evoke describe states world citation
MISC--: taking view human language evolved first means social influence only second means describing representing world help understand why human logical language far containing disinterested dispassionate devices describing reality essentially argumentative structure function citation
MISC--: thus conditionals quantifiers probability expressions humans naturally use when making plans deal uncertainty will implicitly signal speaker s attitude action under question example whether he wishes encourage discourage
MISC--: i argue human communication emerges out expression emotion primarily serves influence behaviour conspecifics citation
MISC--: emotional tone inherent risk communication will influence others respect avoiding dangers planning take advantage opportunities
MISC--: framing polarity effects focus hearer s attention either positive negative aspects question citation pervasive discussions about decisions because actions either taken not taken
MISC--: there no middle ground here one must therefore decide whether flee not flee face threat buy not buy share recruit not recruit candidate
OWNX--: although we hedge qualify judgments saying she s quite rather extremely good making decision we choose saying she s one he s not got what takes
MISC--: due this lack middle ground hard if not impossible give completely disinterested dispassionate advice about decisions normal use human logical vocabulary leads us argue implicitly either against taking action question
MISC--: this pragmatic view risk communication at variance would emerge view language purely representational system
OWNX--: representational view function expert doctor banker might assemble relevant facts present them objective way client so client could make informed decision take treatment make investment
OWNX--: this view aim expert will re present reality client centred way distil view reality relevant what client needs know but disinterested expert does not communicate his own preferences
