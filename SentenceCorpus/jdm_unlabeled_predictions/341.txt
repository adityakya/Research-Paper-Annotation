MISC--: recognition heuristic rh predicts non compensatory reliance recognition comparative judgments attracted much research some disagreement at times
OWNX--: most studies dealt whether under conditions rh truly used paired comparisons
CONT--: however even though rh precise descriptive model there been less attention concerning precision methods applied measure rh use
BASE--: current work i provide overview different measures rh use tailored paradigm natural recognition emerged preferred way studying rh
MISC--: measures compared respect different criteria particular emphasis how well they uncover true use rh
MISC--: this end both simulations re analysis empirical data presented
MISC--: results indicate adherence rate been pervasively applied measure rh use severely biased measure
MISC--: alternative recently developed formal measurement model emerges recommended candidate assessment rh use
MISC--: past decade since was baptized recognition heuristic citation inspired much innovative research
MISC--: been studied extensively normative descriptive point view provoked some controversial debate at times
MISC--: many other interesting investigations notwithstanding majority empirical studies dealt descriptive question whether what extent recognition cue considered isolation how often rh actually used
MISC--: whereas some aimed show this rarely case altogether citation others concentrated bounding conditions determinants rh use citation possible individual differences citation tests alternative cognitive process models citation
MISC--: clearly rh precise model makes exact predictions about choices underlying processes
MISC--: however gain insight about whether under conditions predictions actually correct measurement must also precise
MISC--: although many agree promising fruitful research strategy uncover situational individual determinants fast frugal heuristics broder press yet much less clear how study measure rh use
MISC--: what may at first glance appear rather trivial question turns out represent substantial challenge my view source much controversy surrounding rh
MISC--: so far emphasis been put paradigms materials appropriate studying rh
MISC--: indeed pachur et al citation provided extensive discussion questions
MISC--: they suggested no less than eight critical methodological necessities adequate investigation test rh should their view comprise
MISC--: also they reviewed extant literature argued many previously published studies yield drawbacks respect eight points citation
CONT--: however even if their list studies problematic features had not been somewhat incomplete does bear dilemma proposed necessities if taken seriously leave rather small niche empirical investigations rh worse yet severe problems when attempting measure rh use
OWNX--: i will sketch this problem what follows
MISC--: central point pachur et al citation argue rh more likely used when objects naturally recognized cues must retrieved memory
MISC--: this line assumption inferences memory more often based simple heuristics assumption received support past citation
MISC--: central argument favoring naturally recognized objects rh hinges decision makers acquiring recognition criterion relation through experience thus learning trust recognition when appropriate
MISC--: those who like myself buy into arguments rule out teaching participants artificial objects providing them cues faced severe obstacle how measure use rh when there no control over participants cue knowledge
MISC--: assume participant faced judgment two cities larger recognizes one but not other
MISC--: if she provides judgment recognized object higher criterion value choice line rh produced
CONT--: however cases adherence cannot imply recognition was considered isolation thus do not provide information about use rh
MISC--: more generally participant may adhered prediction cue question actually considering some entirely different piece information points same direction hilbig press
MISC--: case comparing recognized unrecognized city example decision maker may chosen recognized city based knowledge this city international airport large university like
MISC--: thus so long there no control over participants further knowledge specific paired comparisons adherence prediction rh non diagnostic
MISC--: broder schiffer citation put simple counting choices compatible model tells us almost nothing about underlying strategy p number
MISC--: best remedy this caveat course unconfound recognition further knowledge if participants taught certain objects cue patterns typically done when studying other fast frugal heuristics citation alternative approaches citation experimenter full control investigate whether additional cues alter degree participants adhere rh citation
MISC--: indeed unconfounding different cues vital when considering adherence simple one cue strategies citation
MISC--: moreover full experimental control over cue patterns allows application sophisticated methods strategy classification broder schiffer citation proposed bridge gap between theories multi attribute decision making empirically observed choices means formal measurement model
MISC--: this bayesian approach provides information about decision strategy most likely generated data vector
MISC--: recently this approach been extended considering choice outcomes response latencies confidence ratings citation
MISC--: however both elegant approaches necessitate teaching providing all cue patterns set artificial objects so discriminate between different strategies
MISC--: clearly this at odds central methodological recommendations pachur et al citation who call using naturally recognized objects without teaching providing any further information
MISC--: overall paradigm most favored pachur colleagues citation only three pieces information available researchers must base assessment whether rh was used i objects were presented given trial including their true position criterion dimension ii objects recognized participant iii object chosen judged higher criterion value
OWNX--: how based pieces information we measure rh use
MISC--: so far three classes measures been applied viz
MISC--: adherence rate enhanced measures based adherence rates formal measurement model
CONT--: what follows i will introduce measures briefly discuss their theoretical advantages limitations present simulations re analysis existing empirical data evaluate them
