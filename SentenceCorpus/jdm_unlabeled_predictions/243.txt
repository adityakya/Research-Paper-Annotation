OWNX--: using five variants asian disease problem we dissected risky choice framing effect requiring each participant provide preference ratings full decision problem also provide attractiveness ratings each component parts i e sure thing option risky option
MISC--: consistent previous research more risky choices were made respondents receiving negatively framed versions decision problems than those receiving positively framed versions
OWNX--: however different processes were evident those scoring high low numeracy
MISC--: whereas choices less numerate showed large effect frame above beyond any influence their evaluations separate options choices highly numerate were almost completely accounted their attractiveness ratings separate options
MISC--: results consistent increased tendency highly numerate integrate complex numeric information construction their preferences tendency less numerate respond more superficially non numeric sources information
MISC--: tversky kahneman s citation introduction asian disease problem was among earliest examples malleability human decision making
MISC--: at heart this problem choice between riskless option risky option equal expected value
AIMX--: because current study will dissect components prototypical risky choice paradigm exemplified asian disease problem we now describe components
MISC--: sure thing option offers fixed riskless outcome
CONT--: positive framing condition save number out number lives whereas negative condition number will die
OWNX--: risky option offers one third chance saving all lives two thirds chance saving no lives positive condition one third chance no one will die two thirds chance all will die negative condition
MISC--: response this choice problem majority decision makers choose riskless sure thing option over risky option when potential outcomes framed gains lives saved but choose risky option over sure thing option when exact same objective outcomes framed losses deaths
MISC--: later attempts replicate this phenomenon extend other domains money gained lost rather than lives did not always duplicate literal preference reversal but general preference shift more risky choices avoid losses than achieve gains one most solid findings judgment decision making research citation
MISC--: later research uncovered task characteristics individual difference factors moderated reliability magnitude risky choice framing effect citation
AIMX--: present study focuses one individual difference factor
MISC--: aim current study dissect risky choice framing effect into its component parts examine moderating effect important individual difference variable numeracy defined ability understand probabilistic mathematical concepts
OWNX--: we asked participants each framing condition judge full scenario also separately judge both sure thing component risky component
OWNX--: way we assess extent full scenario framing effect driven framing separate components we compare this individuals differing variable known associated more superficial vs more complex processing numeric information decisions
