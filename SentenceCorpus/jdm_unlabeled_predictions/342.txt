MISC--: several approaches judgment decision making emphasize effort reducing properties heuristics
MISC--: one prominent example effort reduction recognition heuristic rh proposes judgments made relying one single cue recognition ignoring other information
OWNX--: our research aims shed light conditions under rh more useful thus relied more often
OWNX--: we propose intuitive thinking fast automatic effortless whereas deliberative thinking slower stepwise more effortful
MISC--: because effort reduction thus much more important when processing information deliberately we hypothesize rh should more often relied situations
OWNX--: two city size experiments we instructed participants think either intuitively deliberatively assessed use rh through formal measurement model
MISC--: results revealed both experiments use rh was more likely when judgments were made deliberatively rather than intuitively
OWNX--: we conclude potential application heuristics not necessarily consequence intuitive processing
MISC--: rather their effort reducing features probably most beneficial when thinking more deliberatively
MISC--: heuristics meant reduce effort
MISC--: indeed without issues processing effort information search costs there would little need examining fewer cues reducing difficulty storing retrieving cue values simplifying weighting principles cues integrating less information all characterize heuristic strategies citation
MISC--: following pioneering work herbert simon citation most approaches judgment decision making dealing heuristic processing specifically emphasize its simplifying properties citation though there some discourse whether heuristics generally less accurate than complex strategies
MISC--: however despite disagreements many would concur heuristics render judgments decisions easier one way another
MISC--: how does heuristic processing relate concept intuitive thinking
MISC--: answer this question treated differently literature one must first specify characteristics intuition
MISC--: herein like many others we define intuitive thinking automatic fast effortless unconscious based vast amounts prior experience citation
MISC--: moreover intuition usually deemed involve integration multiple pieces information weighted additive manner citation
MISC--: intuitive processes little no information processing costs citation enable individuals quickly integrate multiple reasons their decisions compensatory way citation
MISC--: finally intuition typically contrasted deliberation describes slow effortful stepwise mostly rule governed processes citation
OWNX--: sum alter oppenheimer epley eyre citation stated thinking involves two distinct processing systems one quick effortless associative intuitive another slow effortful analytic deliberate p number
CONT--: note however not entirely clear whether intuitive deliberative thinking actually represent two qualitatively different modes thinking rather end points same dimension citation
MISC--: if one accepts two basic notions namely one central appeal heuristics lies their effort reducing properties b intuitive thinking more effortless than deliberation thus rendering effort reduction less appealing following conjecture seems straightforward deliberation will increase need heuristic processing
MISC--: stated differently heuristics should much more helpful when judgments decisions performed slow stepwise effortful manner under conditions deliberation
MISC--: situation heuristics may significantly relieve mind burdensome computations without necessarily leading reduced accuracy citation
MISC--: intuitive thinking however will comprise automatic information integration makes simplification partially obsolete citation
MISC--: note again this hypothesis need not imply intuition deliberation completely different manners thinking so long more intuitive thinking accepted less effortful than more deliberative thinking our conjecture should hold
MISC--: indicated above our view intuition should actually reduce reliance heuristics not consistently echoed literature
MISC--: indeed some considered heuristic processing sense attribute substitution result intuitive thinking citation though they acknowledge attribute substitution also deliberate strategy citation
OWNX--: also although focusing single cue mechanisms rather than attribute substitution gigerenzer citation stated heuristics used without awareness
OWNX--: latter case each provides potential mechanism intuition
MISC--: similarly gigerenzer citation seems advocate fast frugal heuristics his adaptive toolbox approach intuitive mechanisms intuitions ignore information
MISC--: gut feelings spring rules thumb extract only few pieces information ignore rest p number
CONT--: however neither fast frugal heuristics approach nor other related notions citation per se seem make strong claims about extent use heuristics mark intuitive thinking
MISC--: theoretical positions seems largely open question
MISC--: nonetheless intuition reliance heuristics often been equated past citation
OWNX--: contrast we propose clear difference between intuitive thinking heuristics especially those put forward part adaptive toolbox outlined above intuition characterized speedy integration multiple pieces information
MISC--: heuristics contrast ignore information
OWNX--: indeed previous empirical findings consistent our conjecture
MISC--: example glockner betsch citation showed individuals capable integrating complex information within surprisingly short time frame
MISC--: measuring reliance more consciously controlled processes rather than automatic first impressions risky choices using cognitive reflection test citation cokely kelly citation showed more reflective thinking characterized more heuristic search processes
MISC--: similarly frederick citation proposed choice heuristics result more deliberate cognitive processes e g elimination aspects but become automated when affective responses rapidly generated e g choosing liking
MISC--: other studies directly inducing intuitive vs deliberative thinking revealed heuristics more likely applied deliberate rather than intuitive judgments
MISC--: example asking participants think carefully increased reliance anchoring heuristic
MISC--: contrast those instructed answer spontaneously relied their experiences judgmental object rather than experimentally provided anchors citation
MISC--: similar results been reported frequency judgments citation basketball predictions citation judgments randomness citation
