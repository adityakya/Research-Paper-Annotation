MISC--: judgment decision making research overwhelmingly uses null hypothesis significance testing basis statistical inference
CONT--: this article examines alternative bayesian approach emphasizes choice between two competing hypotheses quantifies balance evidence provided data one consequence experimental results may taken strongly favour null hypothesis
AIMX--: we apply recently developed bayesian t test existing studies anchoring effect judgment examine how change approach affects both tone hypothesis testing substantive conclusions one draws
OWNX--: we compare bayesian approach fisherian neyman pearson testing examining its relationship conventional p values influence effect size importance prior beliefs about likely state nature
OWNX--: results give sense how bayesian hypothesis testing might applied judgment decision making research both advantages challenges shift this approach would entail
OWNX--: null hypothesis significance testing nhst we summarize data test statistic determine probability p obtaining test statistic at least extreme one observed if null hypothesis h true
MISC--: low p value taken indicate null hypothesis unlikely true either h false very improbable event occurred
MISC--: nhst many detractors citation various approaches inference been offered alternatives including increased focus effect sizes confidence intervals citation greater emphasis replicability citation
CONT--: perhaps most comprehensive radical alternative nhst adoption bayesian approach hypothesis testing number researchers recently argued more widespread adoption this approach citation
MISC--: while many judgment decision making jdm researchers will familiar bayesian techniques model fitting parameter estimation citation hypothesis testing overwhelmingly conducted nhst framework
MISC--: this article begins introducing bayesian hypothesis testing applying existing work judgment decision making
