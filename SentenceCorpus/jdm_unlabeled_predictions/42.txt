OWNX--: some studies found choices become more risk averse after gains more risk seeking after losses although other studies found opposite
MISC--: latter tend use hypothetical cases encourage deliberation
AIMX--: current study we examined effects prior gains losses task designed encourage less reflective decision making iowa gambling task igt
MISC--: fifty participants conducted manipulated decision making task one group gained money whereas other group lost money followed igt
MISC--: participants who experienced prior monetary loss displayed more risky choice behavior igt than subjects who experienced prior gain
OWNX--: effects were not mediated positive negative affect although sample size may been too small detect small effect
MISC--: kahneman tversky citation noted people often risk averse gains risk seeking losses
MISC--: whether people consider consequence their choice loss gain dependent their point reference
MISC--: this reference point often equivalent current wealth position plays key role theory choice
MISC--: should possible manipulate perceptions domain gain loss actual prior gains losses
MISC--: people may see their starting point before gain loss reference point
MISC--: if they had lost money example they may see new gambles domain losses they therefore might risk seeking
OWNX--: earlier studies effect gains losses show conflicting results
MISC--: thaler johnson citation found opposite resultswhich they called house money effect although their participants would take risks gain back all their loss
OWNX--: weber zuchel citation review this literature find some conditions support prospect theory prediction
MISC--: aside their result however most results consistent prospect theory studies use more realistic situations investment rather than hypothetical tasks
MISC--: some traditional economic studies addressing theories decision making assume decision making based deliberate evaluations varying option outcome scenarios people weigh pros cons various choices against each other base their decision outcome this comparison
MISC--: kinds choices characterized deliberate carefully thought out
MISC--: however some recent psychological studies addressing decision making show decisions also driven less carefully thought out choices citation often implicit automatic citation based gut feelings citation emotions citation
MISC--: recently sanfey et al citation made clear distinction between two psychological systems involved economic decision making emotional system involves activation automatic processes deliberative system involving controlled processes each having separate neural substrates
OWNX--: present contribution we want apply this recent knowledge risk aversion
MISC--: risk aversion after gains consequence people s deliberate conscious decisions avoid risk
MISC--: case risk aversion largely automatic whereby people s current reference point leads them pursue less risky options without deliberately weighting all outcome scenarios
AIMX--: present study we examined role reference point task designed encourage automatic emotional driven decision making iowa gambling task igt
MISC--: during igt participants select cards four decks range probability magnitude rewards punishments citation
OWNX--: translate our hypothesis pertaining risk aversion igt necessary explain igt some detail
MISC--: igt participants repeatedly choose usually up number times between four decks cards
MISC--: two decks e g b disadvantageous
MISC--: they produce large immediate gains but gains followed large losses leading overall loss long run
MISC--: other remaining decks e g c d advantageous
MISC--: gains modest but consistent losses small
MISC--: consistently choosing decks leads gains long run
MISC--: this means people who risk seeking would predominantly choose decks b leading losses long run
MISC--: conversely people who risk averse will predominantly choose decks c d leading overall gain
MISC--: this means risk aversion translates into better performance overall gains igt whereas risk seeking would translate into poor performance overall losses
OWNX--: psychological process determines people s behavior igt crucial our hypothesis risk aversion not only based deliberately weighting all outcome scenarios
MISC--: general consensus people performing igt at some point steer towards certain profitable decks rather automatic way
MISC--: whether this automatic behavior entirely unconscious still subject debate see maia mcclelland citation dunn et al citation
MISC--: behavior igt seen form implicit learning citation whereby behavior changes before people verbalize why they do what they doing
MISC--: therefore igt regarded instrument capable assessing intuitive emotion based decision making processes
OWNX--: addition our central aimto test relative automaticity risk aversionwe another goal
MISC--: economic studies addressing theories decision making often rely hypothetical situations choices participants confronted monetary gambles without any real consequences
CONT--: although use real incentives often not crucial outcome experiments using real incentives important role play establishing quality credibility generalizability experimental data citation
AIMX--: present study we addressed this point using real monetary remunerations order mimic real life decision making more closely
AIMX--: purpose present study we experimentally manipulated reference point
MISC--: participants first performed manipulated gamble task they either gained lost money result their performance actuality they had no influence gains losses
MISC--: note this experimental set up comes close real life situations person s reference point real perceived often result their prior choices
MISC--: known individual differences influence behavioral decision making
MISC--: individual difference variables include reward sensitivity citation gender citation age citation
OWNX--: line previous research citation we expected our experimental manipulation would effect participants affect
MISC--: more precisely prior gain would yield increase positive affect whereas earlier loss would result increase negative affect
MISC--: been suggested affect might influence decision making citation
MISC--: positive affect promote increased sensitivity losses citation
AIMX--: present study we investigated whether above mentioned individual differences affect may additional effect participants decision making
OWNX--: main hypothesis was people who experienced prior gain gambling task performed better i e made more advantageous choices consequence risk aversion igt compared persons who experienced prior loss
OWNX--: furthermore we asked whether this effect was influenced subjective affect various other individual differences
