MISC--: inferences consistent recognition based decision making may drawn various reasons other than recognition alone
MISC--: we demonstrate number alternative forced choice decision tasks less more effects reduced performance additional learning not restricted recognition based inference but also seen circumstances where inference knowledge based but item knowledge limited
MISC--: one reason why effects may not observed more widely dependence effect specific values validity recognition knowledge cues
AIMX--: we show both recognition knowledge validity may vary function number items recognized
MISC--: implications findings special nature recognition information investigation recognition based inference discussed
MISC--: investigations recognition heuristic rh typically involve participants making judgments about items about they limited knowledge relative sizes cities usa
MISC--: example participant might presented two cities san diego san antonio asked bigger
MISC--: classic work goldstein gigerenzer citation assumed participant will guess if they recognize neither items they will use whatever additional knowledge available make decision if they recognize both items crucially if they recognize only one items they will choose this item larger without consulting any other cues searching further information recognition heuristic rh
MISC--: this because items larger size more likely encountered hence more likely recognized recognition magnitude correlation
MISC--: recognizing one two items thus useful cue choosing recognized item
MISC--: if both items recognized however additional knowledge needed make decision additional knowledge may very limited
MISC--: recognition driven inference give rise less more effect lime whereby individuals who recognize many items often perform worse than individuals who recognize fewer items citation
MISC--: lime counter intuitive finding predicted occur under given circumstances if rh applied citation
MISC--: counter intuitive nature lime prediction allows strong test rh been used rhetoric device promote heuristic citation
MISC--: evidence lime also been observed empirically citation but counter this failures observe effect also been cited attempts refute rh citation
MISC--: at least originally introduced lime mathematical necessity given certain assumptions rather than proof recognition based inference
MISC--: nevertheless consensus appears observation lime implies recognition heuristic was employed citation use knowledge will dilute reduce size lime citation
MISC--: here we explore whether limes also mathematical necessities if those assumptions altered somewhat specifically if inference no longer recognition based but instead makes reference some form knowledge
MISC--: limes need not appear only when rh studied isolation
MISC--: they also predicted formal models knowledge based inference if those models exploit recognition principle
MISC--: gigerenzer goldstein citation used appearance effect part their comparison five integration algorithms take best ttb algorithm citation
OWNX--: ttb all integration algorithms were implemented each case recognition was used cue if only one item was recognized p number
MISC--: unsurprisingly all six algorithms produced non monotonic relationship between recognition correct inference citation
BASE--: however we will demonstrate limes produced knowledge based decision making processes use neither recognition driven inference nor related speed retrieval inference schooler hertwig citation shown produces similar advantageous effects moderate over lesser forgetting rates
AIMX--: first aim this paper prove analytical means limes produced knowledge based decision rules
OWNX--: they not unique recognition driven inference cannot therefore viewed providing unconditional support this hypothesis
