MISC--: deliberation without attention effect occurs when better decisions made when people experience period distraction before decision than when they make decisions immediately when they spend time reflecting alternatives
MISC--: this effect been explained citation claim people engage unconscious deliberation when distracted unconscious thought better suited complex decisions than conscious thought
CONT--: experiments number number number b this study included dominant alternative failed find evidence this effect
MISC--: experiment number removed dominant alternative manipulated mode thought within subjects eliminate alternative explanations failed replication
OWNX--: all experiments participants did not make better decisions after unconscious thought decisions were consistently better than chance when made immediately after encoding information
MISC--: encouraging people not think about complex decisions appears unwarranted
MISC--: when making complex decision car purchase should one take time carefully consider information about each alternative should one review information stop thinking about wait best alternative become known
CONT--: benchmark prescriptive model decision making weighted additive wadd strategy citation suggests several steps making complex decisions number list important attributes number weigh each attribute number assess alternatives all attributes number multiply alternatives scores each attribute attribute s weight number sum products each alternative number select alternative greatest sum
MISC--: unconscious thought theory citation proposes conscious thought incapable following steps complex decisions because its capacity limitations but unconscious thought able reach conclusions similar prescriptions wadd
MISC--: therefore utt claims complex decisions best encode all necessary information then stop consciously thinking about alternatives let unconscious arrive at decision
MISC--: evidence utt s claim comes series studies dijksterhuis colleagues
MISC--: studies participants given positive negative attributes few alternatives
OWNX--: all alternatives same number attributes but one alternative most positive attributes one fewest positive attributes
MISC--: designated best worst alternatives respectively
MISC--: after information presented some participants instructed carefully consider information had been presented specified duration before deciding alternative best
OWNX--: other participants distracted e g completing anagrams same duration before making decisions some experiments another group makes decisions immediately after presentation attributes
MISC--: three groups referred conscious thought unconscious thought immediate groups respectively
MISC--: people generally more likely select best alternative after unconscious thought than when decisions judgments made immediately after conscious thought citation
OWNX--: this finding referred deliberation without attention effect
CONT--: deliberation without attention effect been demonstrated complex e g number attributes per alternative but not simple e g number attributes per alternatives decisions citation
MISC--: this effect occurs only when participants informed they will making decision judgment after some duration not when they given information no goal citation
MISC--: furthermore this effect disappears when participants primed think themselves powerful citation
MISC--: dijksterhuis colleagues also suggested many decisions made unconsciously citation found evidence people more satisfied decisions made after period unconscious thought citation
MISC--: because importance implications findings e g people should stop consciously deliberating complex decisions others attempted replicate deliberation without attention effect but found little supporting evidence
MISC--: several studies employed methods similar dijksterhuis citation dijksterhuis et al citation failed find advantage unconscious thought citation
MISC--: payne samper bettman luce citation allowed some participants consciously deliberate long they needed found judgments made after self paced conscious thought led judgments at least good sometimes better than judgments made after period unconscious thought
OWNX--: runnion citation asked participants form impression four cars after acquisition phase found those unconscious condition did not form better memory based judgments best car than conscious deliberators
OWNX--: furthermore gonzales vallejo lassiter bellezza lindberg citation criticized utt being inconsistent findings social cognitive psychology concluded clear evidence deliberation without attention effect lacking because problems dijksterhuis method
MISC--: one criticism dijksterhuis method concerns definition normatively best alternative citation
MISC--: dijksterhuis citation claims alternative most positive fewest negative attributes best choice
OWNX--: illustrate problem this definition consider following example suppose one deciding between two cars each three known attributes
MISC--: car cupholders sunroof but gets poor gas mileage while car b no cupholders sunroof but gets good gas mileage
OWNX--: car two positive one negative attribute car b one positive two negative attributes
MISC--: according dijksterhuis definition normativity one should choose car
MISC--: however person who weighs gas mileage more than sum weights cupholders sunroofs should select car b over car
MISC--: because weighing attributes idiosyncratic when positive negative attributes vary between alternatives difficult know alternative one ought select
MISC--: acker citation newell et al citation asked participants attributes were important their decisions so normativity could determined individual basis
MISC--: avoid problems attribute weighing gonzales vallejo et al citation tested deliberation without attention effect using dominant alternative
MISC--: one alternative dominates another if better at least one attribute at least good every other attribute
MISC--: example if what good about car also present car b but car b also at least one positive attribute not possessed car then car b dominates car
MISC--: no matter how person weighs attributes irrational select judge better dominated alternative citation
MISC--: gonzales vallejo et al citation found after period distraction participants could not select dominant alternative more often than chance
OWNX--: however all participants engaged unconscious thought so performance could not compared immediate decisions those after period conscious thought
OWNX--: despite failed replications deliberation without attention effect further tests warranted
MISC--: recent meta analyses reported mean effect sizes g number favor unconscious thought when compared conscious thought citation g number favor unconscious thought when compared both conscious thought immediate judgments decisions citation
MISC--: new findings continue published showing advantage unconscious thought over conscious thought
MISC--: example dijksterhuis bos van der leij van baaren citation found soccer experts better at predicting outcome soccer matches after period unconscious thought than they when making predictions immediately after period conscious deliberation
OWNX--: furthermore utt supporting findings influenced theories applied areas job design george press
OWNX--: imperative utt continue tested supporting results continue replicated
MISC--: current set experiments participants were given four alternatives one dominated others except experiment number
OWNX--: experiment number compared simple complex decisions made participants after conscious unconscious thought
OWNX--: experiments number number b number participants judged four alternatives after receiving attributes each
MISC--: difference between judgments best worst alternatives participants who engaged unconscious thought was compared those participants who engaged conscious thought experiments number number b those who made immediate judgments experiments number number b number
MISC--: utt predicts participants who engage unconscious thought will select best car more often than chance more often than those who engage conscious thought experiment number
MISC--: furthermore participants who engage unconscious thought will rate best car significantly higher than worst car this difference will greater than difference those who engage conscious thought experiments number number b make immediate judgments experiments number number b number
OWNX--: order alternatives was also examined experiment number alternatives were not blocked experiments number number b number
MISC--: newell et al citation suggest if impressions about alternatives formed during presentation attributes there should recency effect information presented later should greater impact decisions than information presented earlier
