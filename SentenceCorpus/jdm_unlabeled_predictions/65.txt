MISC--: hypotheses about decision processes often formulated qualitatively remain silent about interplay decision memorial other cognitive processes
CONT--: at same time existing decision models specified at varying levels detail making difficult compare them
OWNX--: we provide methodological primer how detailed cognitive architectures act r allow remedying problems
AIMX--: make our point we address controversy namely whether noncompensatory compensatory processes better describe how people make decisions accessibility memories
MISC--: we specify number models accessibility based decision processes act r including noncompensatory recognition heuristic various other popular noncompensatory compensatory decision models
AIMX--: additionally illustrate how models tested we conduct model comparison fitting models one experiment letting them generalize another
MISC--: behavioral data best accounted race models
MISC--: race models embody noncompensatory recognition heuristic compensatory models race between competing processes dissolving dichotomy between existing decision models
OWNX--: one way increase precision theories decision making specify cognitive processes decision making mechanisms assumed draw
MISC--: corresponding process models predict not only what decision person will make but also how information used make decision will processed
MISC--: past decades seen repeated calls develop process models fact models become increasingly popular citation
MISC--: predictions made models motivated number debates example whether people rely noncompensatory lexicographic opposed compensatory weighted additive processes inference choice estimation citation
MISC--: yet often process models underspecified relative process data against they tested
OWNX--: this article we show how precision lent process models implementing them cognitive architecture
MISC--: we will make our point focusing class models assume people make decisions exploiting accessibility citation memory contents
MISC--: models been at focus debate about what processes describe people s decisions best when they make inferences about unknown states world when predicting sports teams likely win competition politician will win election cities likely grow fastest number inhabitants
