MISC--: statement conveys greater risk number people die cancer every day number number people die cancer every year
MISC--: statistics where both frequencies temporal information used convey risk two theories predict opposite answers this question
MISC--: construal level theory predicts number people die cancer every day will judged more risky while ratio bias predicts equivalent number number people die cancer every year will result higher risk judgments
OWNX--: experiment investigated format produces higher risk ratings whether ratings influenced increasing salience numerical temporal part statistic
OWNX--: forty eight participants were randomly assigned numerical temporal control salience condition rated risk framed number deaths per day per year
OWNX--: year format was found result higher perceived risk indicating ratio bias effect dominant but there was no effect salience
MISC--: perception risk important area research not only understanding cognitive processes but also its practical applications conveying risk information public
MISC--: health domain perceived risk generally regarded first step models health behaviour necessary but not sufficient condition behaviour change see weinstein citation van der pligt citation reviews
