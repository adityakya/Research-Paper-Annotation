MISC--: previous research shown association between emotions particularly social emotions moral judgments
OWNX--: some studies suggested association between blunted emotion utilitarian moral judgments observed patients prefrontal lesions
MISC--: order investigate how prefrontal brain damage affects moral judgment we asked sample number tbi patients number females number males number healthy participants number females number males judge number hypothetical dilemmas split into three different categories non moral impersonal personal moral
MISC--: tbi group presented higher proportion affirmative utilitarian responses personal moral dilemmas when compared controls suggesting atypical pattern utilitarian judgements
OWNX--: we also found negative association between performance recognition social emotions proportion affirmative responses personal moral dilemmas
OWNX--: results suggested preference utilitarian responses this type dilemmas accompanied difficulties social emotion recognition
OWNX--: overall our findings suggest deontological moral judgments associated normal social emotion processing frontal lobe plays important role both emotion moral judgment
MISC--: decades moral psychology was dominated kantian like rationalist theories emphasized role conscious reasoning moral judgments adults citation
MISC--: more recently empirical researches suggested moral judgment predominantly intuitive partly based automatic emotional responses effortless produced unconscious processes
MISC--: according perspectives emotional processes play crucial role human decision making including moral decisions citation
MISC--: emotion based accounts moral decision making draws support variety empirical work including behavioural neuroimaging studies citation
MISC--: instance several studies clinical groups brain focal lesions citation reveal association between impaired emotional processing disturbances moral behaviour
MISC--: behavioural studies suggest manipulation emotional states influence judgments some moral situations citation
MISC--: their neuroimaging study koenigs colleagues citation show moral decision making tasks activate same brain areas involved emotions processing
MISC--: impairment emotional behaviour been commonly observed patients focal brain injuries citation specifically patients frontal lesions demonstrate diminished emotional responsivity inadequate coping anger frustration specific circumstances citation
MISC--: this behavioural dysfunction appears related difficulty processing specific social emotions e g compassion shame guilt closely linked moral values citation
MISC--: despite deficits regarding emotional regulation response frontal patients preserve their logical reasoning declarative knowledge social moral norms citation
MISC--: this sense some frontal patients preserve intellectual abilities example fund general information ability repeat reverse digits mental arithmetic verbal reasoning nonverbal problem solving verbal visual anterograde memory visuospacial perception academic achievement maintain factual knowledge social conventions moral rules citation
OWNX--: interestingly besides inadequate emotional processing atypical pattern moral judgements also been observed this clinic population citation
MISC--: experimental study moral judgement frequently relied analysis subject reactions moral dilemmas fictional social situations specifically designed pit two alternative actions against each other choice will inevitably disfavour one parties involved dilemma citation
MISC--: dilemmas often subdivided into three categories non moral impersonal moral personal moral
MISC--: non moral dilemma requires decision never involves moral violation
MISC--: moral dilemma subject must typically choose between act omission omission leading greater harm
MISC--: green colleagues citation distinguished between personal impersonal moral violations
MISC--: they consider moral violation personal if meets three criteria first violation must likely cause serious bodily harm
MISC--: second this harm must befall particular person set persons
MISC--: third harm must not result deflection existing threat onto different party citation
MISC--: three criteria expressed terms me hurt you
MISC--: hurt criterion picks out most primitive kinds harmful violations you criterion ensures victim vividly represented individual me captures notion agency requiring action springs direct way agent s will authored rather than merely edited agent
MISC--: moral violation impersonal if fails meet three criteria
OWNX--: another important distinction between personal impersonal moral dilemmas relates their emotional level personal moral dilemmas characterized high level emotional intensity
MISC--: personal dilemmas particularly intense because moral violation option also represents utilitarian response
MISC--: utilitarian perspective morally correct course action one produces greatest total benefit all people affected citation
MISC--: personal dilemmas utilitarian option involves direct harmful action towards specific individual will favour collective welfare internal conflict results strong emotional aversion this utilitarian response consequent tendency omit
MISC--: securing welfare collective sacrificing single person individual might ultimate moral goal society however choose this utilitarian option appears far natural normal individuals
MISC--: brain damaged patients impaired emotion processing often produce abnormally utilitarian pattern judgments moral dilemmas
MISC--: example patients frontal lesions seem choose suffocate their own child order save group people who otherwise would die including baby citation
MISC--: apparently patients often decide secure welfare collective even if means sacrificing someone dear them utilitarism attitude suggest diminished emotional responsivity
MISC--: anderson barrash bechara citation argue abnormally high rate utilitarian judgments observed frontal brain injured patients deficits emotional response suggests their decisions mostly cognitive intentional conscious uncontaminated emotion
MISC--: functional neuroimaging studies emotion recognition moral judgment tasks highlight pre frontal cortex dominant regulation emotional behaviour well morality citation
MISC--: frontal lesion patients reveal idiosyncratic response patterns some dilemmas when compared patients lesions other brain regions citation
MISC--: several studies further investigating regions frontal cortex would dominant judging moral actions led little consensus among researchers
MISC--: example green colleagues citation suggest ventromedial vmpfc dorsolateral dlpfc anterior cingulate ac cortex involved judging personal moral dilemmas while koenigs colleagues citation postulate ventromedial vmpfc region responsible not only judgment this type dilemmas but also processing more complex emotions i e social emotions guilt shame
OWNX--: actually both authors recognize unique contributions all three regions together relevant moral judgments vmpfc responsible emotional responding ac cognitive conflict dlpfc abstract reasoning
MISC--: studies focusing hemispheric dominance emotion processing moral judgment also provided little consensus
MISC--: order understand whether lateralization prefrontal cortex lesions leads response differences moral dilemmas high emotional level tranel colleagues citation young colleagues citation examined subjects unilateral bilateral lesions
MISC--: both studies reported worse performance patients right bilateral prefrontal cortex lesions
MISC--: following this line research mendez shapira citation also concluded subjects right frontal cortex lesions showed inadequate response pattern emotion processing abnormal judgment personal moral dilemmas
MISC--: results seem converge idea frontal cortex neuronal circuit morality predominance right hemisphere
MISC--: regardless region prefrontal cortex more dominant moral judgments evidence shows damage prefrontal cortex impairs social emotional behaviour leading inevitably some degree social isolation
MISC--: this pattern becomes more severe over time because social opportunities become scarcer cognitive rehabilitation nearly nonexistent citation
MISC--: although several studies examined emotional behavioural changes brain damaged patients few studies pursued changes specifically frontal lesion subjects investigated possible association between social emotion processing moral judgment
OWNX--: thus our first goal compare performance frontal tbi patients group healthy subjects moral judgment task
OWNX--: secondary objective we ask whether tbi patients performance task differs when hemispheric lesion location right left bilateral specific damaged prefrontal cortex region were considered
MISC--: since literature describes association between adequate social emotion processing e g compassion shame guilt judgment moral dilemmas citation our third aim analyze participants tbi patients controls performance social emotion recognition ask ask whether correlates utilitarian responses moral dilemmas
