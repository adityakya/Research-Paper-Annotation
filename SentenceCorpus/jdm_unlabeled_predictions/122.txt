MISC--: decision makers often ambiguity averse preferring options subjectively known probabilities options unknown probabilities
MISC--: ellsberg paradox best known example this phenomenon
MISC--: ambiguity generally been studied domain risky choice many theories ambiguity aversion deal ambiguity only this context
MISC--: however ambiguity aversion may occur other contexts
AIMX--: present experiment we examine effects ambiguity intertemporal choice
MISC--: subjects imagine they expecting package must choose between two delivery options
MISC--: some delivery times exact
MISC--: others ambiguous delivery possible over range dates
MISC--: this problem was structurally identical ellsberg paradox
MISC--: subjects showed same pattern responses traditional ellsberg paradox each delivery service preferred when was unambiguous option
MISC--: ambiguity aversion not specific risk but also occur other domains
MISC--: when faced decision logical first question what will happen if i do this
OWNX--: will this investment make money
MISC--: if i get this treatment will i get better
MISC--: frequently not questions answered certainty
OWNX--: thus second question concerns probabilities what chances this investment will make money
MISC--: if i get this treatment what probability i will get better
MISC--: often questions cannot answered any degree certainty either
OWNX--: while sometimes we make subjectively good estimates probabilities various outcomes at other times we must make decisions under ambiguity decisions we feel we lack knowledge required subjective estimate probability
MISC--: many real world decisions ambiguous
MISC--: apply expected utility theory eut normative theory risky choice ambiguous situations decision makers must produce subjective estimate absent probabilities regardless whether they feel they sufficient information do so
MISC--: according expected utility theory decision maker should evaluate gamble multiplying probability each outcome numerical measure goodness outcome utility
MISC--: sum resulting numbers expected utility gamble decision maker should choose gamble this value higher
MISC--: because derived defensible axioms because no other system will result better aggregate outcomes over time eut considered normative theory decision making citation
MISC--: initially was assumed addition being normative eut also described actual decisions
MISC--: however challenges soon arose suggestion eut descriptive theory choice
MISC--: one earliest objections was made ellsberg citation who proposed what now known ellsberg paradox according eut decision maker should choose same outcome both gamble pairs
MISC--: do otherwise would violate sure thing principle states changing outcome common two gambles should not change decision maker s preference between them
MISC--: if decision maker prefers red gamble black gamble pair one implies decision maker thinks there more red balls than black balls
MISC--: however if there more red balls than black balls there must more total red yellow balls than total black yellow balls decision maker should prefer red gamble black gamble pair two well
MISC--: symmetrical argument demonstrates decision makers who prefer black gamble pair two should prefer black gamble pair one
MISC--: adding common outcome winning number if yellow ball drawn should not change whether decision maker prefers bet red black ball
MISC--: however ellsberg found decision makers prefer red gamble first pair but prefer black gamble second pair
OWNX--: this pattern choices violates sure thing principle thus inconsistent eut
MISC--: instead decision maker shows this pattern choices displaying ambiguity aversion each pair preferring gamble known number balls gambling unknown number
MISC--: subsequent experiments confirmed ellsberg s intuition both about pattern choices shown ellsberg paradox about ambiguity aversion more generally citation
MISC--: ellsberg discussed ambiguity strictly terms risky choice subsequent work generally followed this lead ambiguity defined unknown probability probability decision maker feels she does not enough information make subjective estimate
MISC--: however seems possible ambiguity aversion may more general phenomenon not constrained risky choice
MISC--: specifically analogous phenomena may occur realm intertemporal choice choices made about outcomes occur at different times
MISC--: wide variety real world decisions described intertemporal choices including saving investment decisions preventive health behaviors
MISC--: example investor must choose between spending small amount money now saving money larger amount money later
MISC--: many cases length time will pass before receiving outcome cannot estimated any degree accuracy equivalent ambiguous probabilities risky choice
MISC--: present experiment examines whether effects ambiguity domain delay similar effects ambiguity risky choice
