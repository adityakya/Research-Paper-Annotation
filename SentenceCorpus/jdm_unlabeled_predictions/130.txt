MISC--: evidence anecdotal scientific suggests people treat affected products prestigious sources differently than those less prestigious anonymous sources
AIMX--: products focus present study poems sources poets
OWNX--: we explore manner poet s name affects experience reading poem
OWNX--: study number establishes effect we wish address poet s reputation enhances evaluation poem
AIMX--: study number asks whether only reported evaluation poem enhanced poet s name was case emperor s new clothes enhancement genuine unaware
MISC--: finding latter study number explores whether poet s name changes reader s experience so sense one reading different poem
OWNX--: we conclude not so much attributed poem really differs unattributed poem just ineffably better
MISC--: name highly regarded poet seems prime quality poem becomes somehow better
MISC--: this more subtle bias than deliberate one rejected study number but bias nonetheless
MISC--: ethical implications this kind effect discussed
OWNX--: hearing star soprano attending exhibition famous painter expected exceptional experiences
MISC--: so they should their reputation was acquired precisely their ability provide exceptional experiences
OWNX--: reputation seems capable enhancing experience even retrospect when we only discover next day we had just heard diva visited season s hottest exhibition
MISC--: but hindsight affect remembered experience cannot affect past experience itself citation
MISC--: actual experience poem rather than expected remembered experience affected expectations real time
MISC--: if so how does happen
MISC--: when experience product changed its label change does not occur product
MISC--: would undetected audio recording photograph
OWNX--: this intuition underlying juliet s famous we call rose any other name would smell sweet
MISC--: however experience not determined bottom up processes alone
MISC--: distal stimuli only experienced through proximal stimuli they give rise total experience takes place eyes beholder even ultimately mind beholder
MISC--: hence cognitive psychologists obvious expectations alter experience citation
MISC--: social psychologists cynics however will quick point out one cannot rely people s reports their experiences decide matter because reports not always sincere unbiased
MISC--: glowing evaluation form cognitive snobbery s supposed excellent so i will say excellent social desirability
MISC--: this caveat notwithstanding studies consumer behavior expectations typically manipulated through brand name price other marketing actions evaluations solicited via expressed judgments revealed preferences citation
MISC--: allison uhl citation were among first study variables
MISC--: they found people could not identify their favorite brand beer blind tasting
MISC--: later results were more startling blind tasters cannot distinguish dog food pate citation experienced violinists cannot distinguish stradivari violins new violins citation
MISC--: other hand judges purport distinguish among identical stimuli when labeled differently citation even just framed differently citation
MISC--: when comparing informed evaluations blind evaluations ratings differently labeled but identical products some researchers automatically assume real change occurred experience e g makens number p number well known brand positively affected taste italics ours ss experienced samples turkey meat while others assume will not citation
OWNX--: fact however we should acknowledge certainly possible psychologically speaking actual experience genuinely different blind informed consumers possible actual experience just same blind informed consumers
MISC--: question clearly empirical one moreover its answer could well differ context context individual individual
MISC--: yet few studies tackled this problem
MISC--: lee et al citation when reviewing literature stated remains unclear whether manipulating participant s knowledge also changes experience itself just remains unclear most taste test studies whether brand identity just another input overall evaluation whether modifies actual gustatory experience p number
MISC--: their own study exception will described study number below
AIMX--: present paper another exception
OWNX--: few studies expectation effects used cultural products
CONT--: yet cultural products particular interest both because our intrinsic interest them because question how expectations affect cultural experiences how distinguish between sincere effects cynical hypocritical ones particularly vexing regard ineffable ambiguous experiences artistic ones
MISC--: whereas wines energy drinks pain killers affect consumer s physiology lending credence term marketing placebos citation cultural products paintings music consumed primarily their effect mind
MISC--: harder test whether mental experience altered than whether physiological one
MISC--: this conundrum itself been focus various cultural products e g yasmina reza s play art
AIMX--: present paper will focus ineffable product poetry
OWNX--: study number sets stage establishing effect we will later study depth
MISC--: consists number experiments
MISC--: experiment number shows readers poetry influenced poet s name
MISC--: experiment number incidentally adds without cue quality imparted name reputable poet readers cannot reliably distinguish good poetry bad
OWNX--: taken together study number shows poems ratings sensitive poet s reputation but not poem s quality
MISC--: raises sad possibility effect may wholly due pretension social desirability many outside critics modern contemporary art suspect
MISC--: study number sets out explore this question
OWNX--: tests one particular model we call emperor s new clothes effect enc short honoring anderson s famous parable
MISC--: according this model reading poem same without poet s name giving rise same aesthetic experience enhanced rating solely due deliberate conscious adding points when poem attributed famous poet motivated perhaps desire appear discriminating cultivated
CONT--: study number tests alternative model posits inclusion poet s name alters very experience poem so once poem s author known poem no longer same
MISC--: other words poem unchanged written page somehow changed reader s mind
OWNX--: this we study looking at judgments many specific poem attributes
AIMX--: we regard main novel contribution this paper not showing what happens even this previously unstudied context poetry appreciation but rather attempting understand mental process whereby happens
MISC--: particular we offer experimental paradigms allow one infer whether enhanced evaluation poem any object when labeled expectation raising manner driven deliberate social considerations system number product happens out awareness system number product
MISC--: unfortunate social bias inevitable cognitive bias
