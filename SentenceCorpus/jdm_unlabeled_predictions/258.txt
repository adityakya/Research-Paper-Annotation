MISC--: research shown framing messages terms benefits detriments substantial influence intended behavior
MISC--: prevention behaviors positively framed messages been found elicit stronger behavioral intentions than negatively framed messages
MISC--: research also seems indicate certain contextual features contribute persuasiveness message
CONT--: present research we test how message framing contextually presented affect number argument factors interact contribute persuasiveness health related message
OWNX--: consistent our hypothesis we found our prevention focused task increasing number arguments increased behavioral intentions bi positively framed messages when subjects were cued via negative affect attentive message
MISC--: this resulted significant framing effect messages maximum number arguments negative background picture
MISC--: account contextual influence persuasive health messages discussed
MISC--: persuading people adjust their behavior so more consonant healthy lifestyle no easy matter
MISC--: health care organizations replete attempts at influencing people live more healthy life
MISC--: designers health persuasive messages attempt either encourage more healthy way life discourage unhealthy one
MISC--: determining how presentational frame message influences individuals particular importance health care since effectiveness intended message direct bearing human health quality life
MISC--: foundations understanding how problems frame may affect decision choice were laid kahneman tversky s citation prospect theory
MISC--: central aspect this work people will respond differently depending upon how decision problem presented
MISC--: specifically decisions may presented manner accentuate either positive gains negative losses aspects task
MISC--: effect positive negative presentation decision choice referred framing effect
MISC--: because vast applicability decision framing distinct areas investigation emerged
MISC--: levin schneider gaeth citation lsg distinguished between three types framing risky choice attribute goal framing
MISC--: because most research health related choices involves persuasion citation many health messages categorized goal framing
MISC--: goal framing refers messages contain arguments describing either benefits adopting gains positive costs not adopting losses negative behavior
MISC--: distinguishing feature goal framing attempts persuade decision makers adopt specific behavior remains same across frames
MISC--: consider classic example provided detweiler bedell salovey pronin rothman citation beachgoers were given message regarding sunscreen use varied only its gain loss frame
MISC--: both gain loss framed messages promoted same behavior were similar length structure
MISC--: one gain framed argument was using sunscreen increases your chances maintaining healthy young looking skin
MISC--: corresponding loss framed argument stated not using sunscreen decreases your chances maintaining healthy young looking skin
MISC--: subjects reported their behavioral intentions use sunscreen via questionnaire actual behavior was measured noting number people each condition who later redeemed coupon sunscreen
MISC--: consistent their previous research gain framed messages proved elicit greater levels behavioral intention actual behavior
MISC--: regard health related messages gain framed messages been found elicit greater behavioral intention bi prevention behaviors while loss framed messages been found elicit greater bi detection behaviors citation
MISC--: prevention behaviors refer those behaviors health promoting little risk perceived
MISC--: conversely detection behaviors those behaviors health detecting infer some amount risk their performance
CONT--: previously investigated prevention behaviors include sunscreen use condom use smoking cessation
MISC--: thus relative advantage gain framed messages regard prevention behaviors been well established
MISC--: while analysis provided levin schneider gaeth provides structure varying types framing does not address potential interactions may exist certain psychological variables
MISC--: they point out goal frames more complicated than other frames
MISC--: they also add complication lies how goal framing manipulates several linguistic contextual variations within same task
AIMX--: present paper we set out examine two variables we identified being particular importance this type persuasion task contextually influenced affect number arguments presented
MISC--: extensive body research examined how affect emotions influence decision making citation
MISC--: although many different accounts depict how affect influences information processing subsequent decision choices one explanation affect information account proposed schwarz colleagues citation
MISC--: according this view negative affect acts signal inform people they may not achieving their desired state goal given task
MISC--: consequently this draws their attention task at hand people become more involved attentive task
MISC--: other hand positive affect informs people all well they do not need seek out any additional information
MISC--: result people less attentive tend not seek out additional information task when experiencing positive affect
OWNX--: one way inducing either positive negative affect involves presentation affect laden stimuli background image
MISC--: supporting affect information view this research shown negative images elicit greater attention stronger response than either positive neutral stimuli citation
MISC--: prior research investigating persuasive health messages found gain framing elicits greater behavioral intentions tasks focused prevention health related issues citation task we use here
MISC--: further part persuasiveness message may rest number arguments presented
MISC--: general persuasiveness should increase number arguments increases
OWNX--: however magnitude this effect should determined both attentiveness framing task
MISC--: if participants not attentive task because positive affect cues then neither frame nor argument number should particularly influential
OWNX--: accordingly we predict behavioral intentions should not differ function number arguments when positive background picture present
MISC--: other hand when context contains negative affect cues decision maker should more attentive task
OWNX--: our prevention task we predict gain framed messages persuasiveness should increase number arguments increases
MISC--: however because negatively framed messages less effective encouraging prevention behaviors this suggests decision makers will less involved task when framed negatively
OWNX--: consequently we predict number arguments will less influential when problem negatively framed
OWNX--: sum we expect increasing numbers arguments should most influential when negative affect cue present messages framed gains
