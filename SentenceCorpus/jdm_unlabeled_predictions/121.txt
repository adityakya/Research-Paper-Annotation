MISC--: current study examines construct validity maximization scale citation maximization tendency scale citation well nomological net maximizing construct
OWNX--: we find both scales maximizing suffer psychometrically especially their proposed dimensionality
AIMX--: using confirmatory factor analysis item response theory irt we identify remove three problematic items mts six problematic items ms
MISC--: additionally we find ms appears measuring difficulty restlessness search best alternative whereas mts more focused search best option regardless choice difficulty
OWNX--: we then examined revised scales relation other psychological constructs nomological net maximizing found maximizers may not unhappy but generally distressed decision making context
BASE--: finally we suggest future maximizng research use revised form mts seems us most consistent original concept maximizing satisficing
MISC--: conceptualization measurement maximizing construct received considerable attention last ten years citation
MISC--: traditional economic models choice theorized individuals pursue maximization goal decision making contexts
MISC--: however evaluation existing data economic models simon citation stated evidently organisms adapt well enough satisfice they do not general optimize
MISC--: building this research schwartz et al attempted define psychological effects maximizing those who pursue maximizing goals
MISC--: specifically they theorized environments lot choice individuals maximizing goal would likely unhappy regret their decisions
MISC--: schwartz et al developed number item measure maximization maximization scale ms found scores ms correlated positively depression perfectionism regret correlated negatively happiness life satisfaction optimism self esteem
MISC--: since development this scale there been considerable debate about validity measure development alternative measures
MISC--: diab et al citation developed new maximization scale maximizing tendency scale mts found mts did not correlate constructs depression life satisfaction neuroticism
CONT--: however their scale did correlate positively regret
MISC--: nenkov et al citation modified ms created number item scale was found better psychometric characteristics than original number item scale
MISC--: lai citation also developed new scale maximizing found correlated positively optimism need cognition but correlation between her measure maximizing regret was inconsistent across samples
MISC--: finally rim et al citation examined both ms mts using item response theory irt found both scales had weakness measuring maximizing construct
MISC--: they also found mts was not unidimensional proposed diab et al citation
CONT--: however rim et al did not discuss removing problematic items
AIMX--: purpose current study examine both ms mts using exploratory confirmatory factor analysis then use polytomous irt resolve problems found scales
OWNX--: addition we test whether solutions answer question whether maximizers happy unhappy
