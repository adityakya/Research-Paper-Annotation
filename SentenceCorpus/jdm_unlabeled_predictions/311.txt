MISC--: researchers frequently argue within subjects designs should avoided because they result research hypotheses transparent subjects study
MISC--: this conjecture was empirically tested replicating several classic between subjects experiments within subjects designs
OWNX--: two additional experiments psychology students were given within subjects versions studies asked guess what researcher was hoping find i e research hypothesis members society judgment decision making sjdm were asked predict how well students would perform this task
OWNX--: whole students were unable identify research hypothesis when provided within subjects version experiments
OWNX--: furthermore sjdm members were largely inaccurate their predictions transparency within subjects design
MISC--: field psychology there long standing controversy over appropriate use between within subjects designs
MISC--: within subjects designs greater power less variability but many researchers eschew their use two reasons
OWNX--: first been argued within subjects designs render our research hypotheses transparent citation
OWNX--: within subjects design subjects will aware purposes our experiment may behave accordingly thus posing threat internal validity experiment
MISC--: second some argued life more similar between subjects design citation
MISC--: therefore between subjects designs increase generalizability experimental findings
MISC--: however others argued between subjects designs pose their own risks
MISC--: parducci citation birnbaum citation contend particularly subjective judgments between subjects design should abandoned because results confounding context stimulus
MISC--: most famous demonstration this principle was provided birnbaum citation who showed between subjects design subjects rated number number being significantly larger than number
OWNX--: theoretically between subjects design two conditions identical except manipulation single stimulus
MISC--: this case stimulus manipulated was number being rated number number
MISC--: however birnbaum argues subjective judgments cannot made isolation they require context
OWNX--: within subjects design context specified two more conditions compared each other
MISC--: between subjects design subjects left construct their own context evaluate stimulus
MISC--: when this case very likely different contexts will invoked different stimuli
MISC--: this example number likely bring mind other single digit numbers comparison thus leaving impression number relatively large number
MISC--: contrast number likely bring mind other triple digit numbers comparison leaving impression number relatively small number
OWNX--: thus between subjects design both stimuli context vary between conditions confounding results
MISC--: although relative merits may theoretically debated what more troubling hypotheses tested two designs often do not result same conclusions citation
MISC--: example between subjects comparisons manipulations base rates do not affect judgments probability leading conclusion base rates ignored citation
CONT--: however within subjects comparisons base rates large significant effects judgments probability leading conclusion base rates not ignored citation
MISC--: despite concerns about using between subjects designs evaluate subjective judgments raised birnbaum others appears within subjects design fallen out favor many areas psychology
MISC--: particular within judgment decision making there exist many findings supported almost exclusively between subjects data
MISC--: examples include hindsight bias citation research reason based choice citation availability citation support theory citation many classic demonstrations heuristics biases citation
MISC--: researchers areas frequently argued between subjects designs more appropriate
MISC--: one main reasons cited superiority between subjects designs belief within subjects designs transparent citation
MISC--: although this appears popular reason rejecting within subjects design this assertion never been empirically tested
OWNX--: thus this gap literature inspired two specific aims this research
OWNX--: first aim was determine if classic examples between subjects designs could replicated using within subjects designs
