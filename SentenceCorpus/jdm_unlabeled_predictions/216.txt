MISC--: forecasting decision making people often do represent degree belief some proposition
OWNX--: at least two separate constructs capture degrees belief likelihoods capturing evidential balance support capturing evidential weight
AIMX--: this paper explores weight justification evidence affords propositions subjects communicating using belief function hypothetical legal situations where justification relevant goal
MISC--: subjects evaluated impact sets numbernumber pieces evidence varying complexity within hypothetical legal situation
OWNX--: study demonstrates potential usefulness this evidential weight measure alternative complement more studied probability measure
OWNX--: subjects responses indicated weight likelihood were distinguished subjects evidential weight tended toward single elements targeted fashion there were identifiable individual differences reactions conflicting evidence
OWNX--: specifically most subjects reacted conflicting evidence supported disjoint sets suspects continued support implicated sets although identifiable minority reacted pulling back their support expressing indecisiveness
MISC--: individuals would likely require greater amount evidence than others counteract this tendency support
OWNX--: thus study identifies value understanding evidential weight distinct likelihood informs our understanding psychology individuals judgments evidential weight furthers application meaningfulness belief functions communication language
MISC--: probabilities useful when acting absence complete knowledge e g forecasting decision making
MISC--: probabilities interpreted measures degrees likelihood assessed against criterion truth citation
MISC--: scoring rules assessments quality probability judgments operate this perspective comparing likelihood assessments actual outcomes application truth criterion citation
MISC--: however very origins probability theory scholars recognized truth not only criterion potential interest interpreting probabilities
CONT--: smith benson curley citation tied this recognition philosophical analysis knowledge number justified true belief number citation use probabilities qualifications beliefs fall short knowledge
MISC--: analysis highlights two separate criteria along beliefs may qualified truth justification
OWNX--: this theoretical distinction forms basis long standing differentiation between pascalian probability based likelihood relative criterion truth baconian probability based support relative criterion justification
MISC--: citation
MISC--: distinction also basis common differentiation between weight balance evidence traced keynes citation played major role motivating study ambiguity decision making beginning ellsberg citation
MISC--: short likelihoods intended capture balance evidence connected criterion truth
MISC--: if true not false
OWNX--: degree evidence favors balance evidence moves toward away not equal measure
MISC--: weight evidence connected criterion justification
MISC--: weight depends upon quantity credibility evidence how much good evidence there
CONT--: how well does evidence afford any differentiation possibilities
OWNX--: unlike evidential balance evidential weight does not imply complementarity
MISC--: probability theory when judgment one hypothesis increases sum judgments remaining hypotheses must decrease same amount
MISC--: truth one only one mutually exclusive set events occur thus likelihoods should exhibit complementarity probabilities capture this feature
OWNX--: contrast evidential weight construct grounded criterion justification not expected exhibit this property
OWNX--: increased support one possibility does not necessarily impinge support other possibilities
AIMX--: belief functions dempster shafer theory discussed this paper justification based measures do not incorporate complementarity necessary axiom
MISC--: one source confusion between constructs likelihood weight measures attached them constructs measures generally correlate
MISC--: useful analogy drawn here height weight two aspects size
MISC--: though measures correlate they capture distinct size constructs
MISC--: similarly probabilities measures likelihood belief functions measures justification may correlate but they capture different degree belief constructs
MISC--: griffin tversky citation provided demonstration usefulness distinction showing how inclusion considerations weight addition balance evidence serve explain various empirical characteristics confidence judgments
MISC--: there number situations justification primary interest decision maker interest addition truth
MISC--: example justification interest legal settings where goal remove doubt stock analysis emphasis upon justifying recommendations clients diagnostic tasks truth not feasibly determinable e g within public policy debates scientific inference citation
MISC--: despite this history their potential usefulness measures justification been little studied empirically been confounded measures likelihood
MISC--: research probably been somewhat hampered respective different natures truth justification
MISC--: probability theory capturing likelihoods benefits ultimate realization truth many instances applied because underpinnings randomization relative frequency historically derives citation
MISC--: application system used capturing justification use dempster shafer theory this purpose more equivocal about underlying theoretical mechanisms supporting judgments citation
MISC--: here argument applying dempster shafer theory based correspondence between aspects evidential weight unique features theory e g its noncomplementarity natural representation ignorance i e case where no information present citation
MISC--: terms previous work using dempster shafer theory most prior research this system been theoretical example pursuing use belief functions propagating uncertainty ai expert systems addition instead using probabilities citation
MISC--: although sparse there some suggestive empirical work
MISC--: cited work griffin tversky citation directly extensive work effects ambiguity decision making citation indirectly testify relevance evidential weight decision behavior
MISC--: addition responses hypothetical legal contexts emphasize justification exhibit noncomplementarity degrees belief manner consistent tenets dempster shafer theory citation
MISC--: briggs krantz citation adopted measurement perspective demonstrated judgments evidential strength separable
CONT--: subjects number showed clear separation relevant irrelevant evidence designated surrounding relevant evidence number p number
OWNX--: sum results support value viability measuring evidential weight distinct more commonly assessed construct likelihood
MISC--: since likelihood judgments received more attention than weight judgments often confused them particular emphasis must placed this distinction
MISC--: specifically important distinctions discussions literature need drawn separating justification based measures present application dempster shafer theory weak theories likelihood theory subjective probability called support theory
