MISC--: one major statistical methodological challenge judgment decision making research reliable identification individual decision strategies selection diagnostic tasks tasks predictions strategies differ sufficiently
MISC--: more strategies considered larger number dependent measures simultaneously taken into account strategy classification citation more complex selection most diagnostic tasks becomes
OWNX--: we suggest euclidian diagnostic task selection edts method standardized solution problem
MISC--: according edts experimental tasks selected maximize average difference between strategy predictions any multidimensional prediction space
OWNX--: comprehensive model recovery simulation we evaluate quantify influence diagnostic task selection identification rates strategy classification
MISC--: strategy classification edts shows superior performance comparison less diagnostic task selection algorithms representative sampling
MISC--: advantage edts particularly large if only few dependent measures considered
MISC--: we also provide easy use function free software package r allows generating predictions most commonly considered strategies specified set tasks evaluating diagnosticity those tasks via edts thus apply edts no prior programming knowledge necessary
MISC--: identification individuals decision strategies always challenged behavioral decision research
MISC--: there at least three traditional approaches
MISC--: structural modeling applies regression based approach identify relation between distal criterion variable proximal cues peoples judgments citation process tracing methods example record information search citation use think aloud protocols citation trace decision process citation whereas comparative model fitting approaches investigate fit data predictions different models determine model decision strategy employed citation
MISC--: comparative model fitting particular gained popularity recent judgment decision making jdm research
AIMX--: this paper we discuss problem diagnostic task selection when using this strategy classification method
OWNX--: we suggest euclidian diagnostic task selection edts method standardized solution
