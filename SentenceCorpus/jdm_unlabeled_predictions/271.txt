MISC--: genetic screening brca number brca number gives women opportunity early detection surveillance intervention
MISC--: one key feature genetic testing counseling provision personal lifetime risk
MISC--: however little attention been paid how women interpret lifetime risk information despite fact they base screening treatment family planning decisions information
OWNX--: study this vital issue we set out test ability women choose most appropriate interpretation national cancer institute s nci message about lifetime risk developing cancer woman altered brca number brca number genes
OWNX--: participants included number women who had not undergone genetic testing had cancer number women who had undergone genetic testing had cancer
MISC--: over number percent women who had not undergone genetic testing had cancer number percent those who had undergone genetic testing had cancer misunderstood nci s information
OWNX--: furthermore line growing body research we found high numeracy level objective subjective positively associated woman s ability correctly interpret nci s message
MISC--: genetic screening brca number brca number gene mutations associated higher risk developing breast ovarian cancers gives women shot at early detection surveillance intervention citation
MISC--: one key feature genetic counseling process provision personal lifetime risk risk developing specific disease during one s lifetime citation
MISC--: indeed both patients genetic counselors rate communication lifetime risk information pivotal part process citation
MISC--: this not surprising women who test positive brca number number often rely lifetime risk estimates make future family plans citation decide whether undergo mastectomy despite being cancer free citation
MISC--: given importance lifetime risk information researchers been interested whether women overestimate underestimate their lifetime risk developing cancer citation
MISC--: others investigated relationship between risk perception emotional reaction well between risk perception mammography screening whether leaflets genetic testing risk counseling improve women s accuracy estimating their lifetime risk developing cancer citation
MISC--: although earlier studies examined women s estimation their lifetime risk more fundamental issue how women interpret lifetime risk information
MISC--: after all if women misunderstand meaning lifetime risk whether they overestimate underestimate incorrectly interpreted risk would less important
MISC--: indeed research shown people interpret numerical probabilities multiple mutually contradictory ways
MISC--: researchers citation demonstrated individuals interpret seemingly unambiguous statement there number percent chance rain tomorrow different ways will rain tomorrow number percent region number percent time number percent days like tomorrow citation
MISC--: since people misconstrue common mundane probabilistic information interpreting probabilistic information like lifetime risk developing cancer proves even greater challenge given added emotional impact
CONT--: authors knowledge however no previous studies examined how women interpret statements regarding their lifetime risk developing cancer what variables e g numeracy might affect women s ability correctly interpret information
MISC--: growing corpus research shown numeracy ability understand basic mathematical concepts important quality decisions citation
MISC--: accordingly researchers long argued numeracy levels play key role host medical decision making might influence way people perceive understand risk citation
MISC--: recent review citation summarized this idea well low numeracy pervasive constrains informed patient choice impairs risk communication affects medical outcome citation
MISC--: while data strongly indicate existence relationship between numeracy medical decision making whether numeracy levels affect women s ability interpret lifetime risk data still unanswered question
OWNX--: light abovementioned research gap existing literature we set out examine two related hypotheses
OWNX--: we first predicted statement about lifetime risk developing cancer would give rise various interpretations not all would correct
OWNX--: second we predicted participants higher numeracy levels will better understanding lifetime risk information than their peers lower numeracy levels
