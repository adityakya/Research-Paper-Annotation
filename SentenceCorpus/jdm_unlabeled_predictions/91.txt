OWNX--: we investigated extent human capacity recognition helps forecast political elections we compared naive recognition based election forecasts computed convenience samples citizens recognition party names i standard polling forecasts computed representative samples citizens voting intentions ii simple typically very accurate wisdom crowds forecasts computed same convenience samples citizens aggregated hunches about election results
OWNX--: results four major german elections show mere recognition party names forecast parties electoral success fairly well
MISC--: recognition based forecasts were most competitive other models when forecasting smaller parties success small sample sizes
MISC--: however wisdom crowds forecasts outperformed recognition based forecasts most cases
MISC--: seems wisdom crowds forecasts able draw benefits recognition while at same time avoiding its downsides lack discrimination among very famous parties recognition caused factors unrelated electoral success
MISC--: yet seems simple extension recognition based forecasts asking people what proportion population would recognize party instead whether they themselves recognize also able eliminate downsides
MISC--: trouble free elections you never know who going win former political leader soviet union leonid brezhnev supposed said once citation
CONT--: this did not only bother brezhnev but also keeps polling agencies busy around world
MISC--: they usually rely intention based election forecasts generated interviewing large representative samples citizens about their voting intentions
MISC--: instance germany potential voters typically asked political party they will vote upcoming election
OWNX--: resulting responses used extrapolate likely election results
OWNX--: here we investigate how far one get much simpler almost naive method does not require large representative samples
AIMX--: specifically we test how well citizens memories they heard party name before citizens mere recognition party names allows forecasting outcomes major political elections
MISC--: we compare performance recognition based election forecasts computed small unrepresentative convenience samples citizens other forecasting methods including i traditional polls computed large representative samples citizens voting intentions ii simple but typically very accurate forecasting method builds aggregated judgments many wisdom crowds citation
MISC--: article structured follows
OWNX--: first we review previous research showing recognition allows making accurate forecasts many domains
MISC--: second we explain why recognition could accurate predictor variable forecasting elections why recognition based election forecasts could particularly useful forecasting smaller political parties electoral success
AIMX--: third we introduce election forecasts based wisdoms crowds
