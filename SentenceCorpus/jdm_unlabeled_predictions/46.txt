MISC--: researchers decision making tradition usually analyze multiple decisions within experiments aggregating choices across individuals using individual subject unit analysis
OWNX--: this approach mask important variations patterns within data
MISC--: specifically ignores variations decisions across task game possible influences characteristics subject experiment variations
OWNX--: we demonstrate reanalyzing data two previously published articles how mixed model analysis addresses limitations
OWNX--: our results modified iowa gambling task prisoner s dilemma game illustrate ways analysis test hypotheses not possible other techniques more parsimonious more likely faithful theoretical models
MISC--: experiments within broad decision making tradition involve subjects making multiple decisions either different partners groups citation repeated decisions learning task citation
MISC--: analyses data typically involve examination how rewards received related characteristics experiment individuals involved citation
MISC--: complex multivariate analyses relatively rare
OWNX--: this typical analytic approach at least one major drawback
MISC--: most studies this tradition involve multiple decisions each individual
MISC--: each subject participates several decisions
MISC--: entirely possible individuals vary their decisions across rounds play they engage
OWNX--: looking at average results decisions could mask important variations patterns within data
MISC--: aggregated analyses do not allow researcher fully examine ways characteristics participants experimental design affect decisions
CONT--: other words analyses provide descriptive results but only hints decision making dynamics within experiments
OWNX--: we suggest data experiments fit classic form multi level nested data sets they usually include multiple decisions actor within one more set conditions
OWNX--: mixed models been specifically developed deal multi level units observation help us understand process dynamics decision making within our studies
AIMX--: this paper we describe logic mixed model analyses contrasting them familiar within between subject designs
OWNX--: we then demonstrate use models decision making data reanalyzing data two previously published articles
MISC--: first study citation involves modification iowa gambling task multiple decisions individual players response variety stimuli second citation involves prisoner dilemma games conducted within seven person groups
CONT--: finally we briefly describe wide range possible applications advantages approach provide pragmatic advice using hierarchical models encourage their broader use decision making research
OWNX--: although major aim this paper illustrate utility this method we include appendix sas language used our analyses provide greater transparency encourage use method
MISC--: mixed model one there both between within subject variables
MISC--: noted above studies decision research literature often focus exclusively between subject variables their analyses ignore within subject variables those affect variations decisions one individual makes
MISC--: yet variations individuals decisions often theoretically substantively important
OWNX--: thus we argue more natural fruitful parsimonious analyze many decision making studies using mixed model approach
MISC--: addition mixed models very flexible adapt wide variety experimental designs
OWNX--: pure within subjects design all subjects serve all treatment conditions
MISC--: first panel table number illustrates this design assuming there two different design elements b
MISC--: this design each subject s participates each condition design element design element b b
MISC--: example would classic lichtenstein slovic citation study gamblers las vegas casino showed within subject preference reversals based response mode bids choices
MISC--: pure between subjects design one each subject serves only single condition there no within subject variation
MISC--: this design illustrated second panel table number where each subject s only one condition two design conditions b
MISC--: other words pure between subjects design subjects nested within b ab each subject contributes single observation dependent variable thus appears only single treatment condition
MISC--: many decision making studies use this design citation simplify their data mimic this design summarizing across all decisions individual makes form summary score citation
OWNX--: this summary number then used dependent variable
MISC--: researchers also use design involves repeated measures conditions one more factors presented each subject within subject variables set rewards neuroimaging study variables gender culture experimental conditions positive negative frames subjects do not share between subject variables
MISC--: this design frequently referred psychologists mixed design illustrated third part table number b within subjects factor between subjects factor
MISC--: term mixed particularly apt there sources variance produced between subjects differences within subjects differences both types differences contribute statistical analysis
AIMX--: this design allows us assess within subject differences at same time we study between subject relationships
OWNX--: design also allows us model dependency successive decisions what technically called auto regression tendency individuals behave similar manner one decision another
MISC--: researchers used mixed models variety settings
MISC--: much original work mixed models was conducted agricultural settings thus statisticians also refer models split plot design
CONT--: agricultural setting plots were often considered random each plot exposed same set fixed experimental conditions one experimental variables while plots were nested within experimental conditions different experimental variable
MISC--: mixed designs contain at least one within subject plot variable at least one between subject plot variable citation
MISC--: panel models used economists both between units often firms component within units changes over time component citation
MISC--: sociologists used hierarchical linear models examine influence characteristics school classrooms entire schools individual student achievement citation
MISC--: developmental psychologists educational researchers used models examine growth curves changes individuals achievement developmental characteristics within subject variable students varying different characteristics between subject analysis citation
MISC--: thus there wide variety analytical methods pay close attention within between individual group variables
MISC--: two widely used general modeling strategies hierarchical linear models mixed models
MISC--: either allows modeling random variation individuals decisions nested within individuals
OWNX--: situations analyzed this paper either hierarchical linear modeling mixed modeling approach used
AIMX--: we suggest general logic this approach applied issues facing experimenters studying decision making help researchers develop more accurate understanding elements decision making process lead hypothesized outcomes
MISC--: within many experiments given individual makes numerous choices often across variety experimental settings
OWNX--: because individuals make multiple decisions decisions not statistically independent
OWNX--: usual method handling data simply aggregate all decisions level individual ignore any intra individual variation
MISC--: practice however ignores potential variation limits extent researchers assess impact experimental variables individual choice
MISC--: also encourages researchers conduct numerous separate bivariate analyses
CONT--: use mixed models provide both more inclusive yet more parsimonious efficient method analysis
OWNX--: we now illustrate utility models reanalyzing data two different studies
