OWNX--: ambiguity aversion been widely observed individuals judgments
OWNX--: using scenarios typical decision analysis we investigate ambiguity aversion pairs individuals
AIMX--: we examine risky cautious shifts individuals original judgments their judgments when they paired up dyads
OWNX--: our experiment participants were first asked specify individually their willingness pay six monetary gambles
OWNX--: they were then paired at random into dyads were asked specify their willingness pay amount same gambles
MISC--: dyad s willingness pay amount was shared equally two individuals
OWNX--: six gambles our experiment one involved no ambiguity remaining five involved different degrees ambiguity
OWNX--: we found dyads exhibited risk aversion well ambiguity aversion
MISC--: majority dyads exhibited cautious shift face ambiguity stating smaller willingness pay than two individuals average
OWNX--: our study thus confirms persistence ambiguity aversion group setting demonstrates predominance cautious shifts dyads
MISC--: much theoretical experimental research decision analysis examined how individuals do should make choices set prices they willing pay risky ambiguous options
MISC--: but not much focus been placed decisions made groups though group decisions common
MISC--: would helpful understand relationship between individual decisions group decisions first examining simplest setting pricing lottery
MISC--: start this direction primary question we address here via experiment when decision makers act two person group called dyad do they exhibit more less ambiguity aversion than observed individual settings
OWNX--: we note some situations forecasting e g delphi technique two heads indeed better than one
MISC--: context monetary policy blinder morgan citation find groups make better decisions than individuals
MISC--: therefore natural examine how decisions under ambiguity differ when made individually versus when made dyads
MISC--: many real world decisions entrusted groups hope collective wisdom will prevail
MISC--: will individuals our scenarios share their knowledge see light probability winning due construction our scenarios at least number number therefore become less ambiguity averse
MISC--: risk aversion consistent rational decision making been observed variety settings
MISC--: evidence ambiguity aversion been mixed
MISC--: raiffa citation argued rational decision maker should not ambiguity averse
MISC--: fox tversky citation found ambiguity aversion disappears when individuals evaluate single gamble non comparative setting chow sarin citation found ambiguity aversion reduced when making separate evaluations
MISC--: sarin weber citation found market settings ambiguity aversion reduced independent auctions but not simultaneous auctions
OWNX--: we at least two reasons expect less ambiguity aversion thus higher prices dyads
MISC--: first two people face face discussion may more fully understand ambiguous setting they facing
OWNX--: because our subjects know our scenarios they choose either side bet discussion between two subjects may lead realization probability winning at least number number
MISC--: second individual blame regret should moderated group setting
