MISC--: present research investigated relationship between individual differences maximizing versus satisficing i e seeking make single best choice rather than choice merely good enough well being interaction society individual lives
OWNX--: data three distinct cultural groups adults drawn respectively u s n number western europe n number china n number were analyzed
OWNX--: results showed societies where choice abundant i e u s western europe maximizers reported less well being than satisficers this difference was mediated experienced regret
MISC--: however non western society china maximizing was unrelated well being
MISC--: although china maximizing was associated more experiences regret regret had no substantial relationship well being
MISC--: patterns also emerged individual facets maximizing scale although notable difference between u s europe high standards facet
MISC--: argued societies where abundant individual choice highly valued considered ultimate route personal happiness maximizers dissatisfaction regret over imperfect choices detrimental factor well being whereas much less crucial determinant well being societies place less emphasis choice way happiness
MISC--: autonomy choice individual decision making highly valued western societies
MISC--: greater choice provide two types benefits
MISC--: first enable choosers find exactly what they want
MISC--: secondly enhance their feeling autonomy freedom
MISC--: nonetheless various studies recently cautioned unlimited choice may come at price does not always benefit mental health well being citation
MISC--: this regard schwartz citation argued options added within domain choice several problems may materialize
MISC--: first process collecting adequate complete information about options makes choosing more laborious
MISC--: second options expand people s standards what acceptable outcome rise
MISC--: thirdly people may come believe any imperfect result their fault because so many options they no excuse not getting right one
MISC--: ironically however more options there more likely becomes one does not choose best option citation
MISC--: problems become especially relevant contemporary western societies where people overwhelmed near unlimited options all domains life
MISC--: this regard bellah madsen sullivan swinder tipton citation already argued people western societies feel increasingly uneasy about their life decisions because they unsure about whether they making right choices according schwartz citation this excess freedom p number resulted dramatic increase people s dissatisfaction their lives even clinical depression
MISC--: however not everybody may equally sensitive problems come exposure abundance choice
MISC--: been argued people who always want maximize outcomes their choices most vulnerable negative effects too much choice citation
MISC--: people excess options becomes problematic because make sure they choose optimal option all information about each alternative considered often difficult even impossible
MISC--: moreover there likely lingering doubt best option nevertheless been missed especially when not been possible consider all options
MISC--: hence potential regret ever present because there always possibility there better option out there failing find means failure optimize personal satisfaction
MISC--: other hand people approach choices differently using good enough strategy any option meets certain threshold acceptability considered satisfactory
MISC--: this approach choice individual does not consider all information about each option standards what acceptable more modest meaning several options satisfactory standards do not depend number options because adding more options does not suddenly render good option unacceptable
MISC--: moreover there no failure choosing merely decent but not perfect option when adopting good enough approach choice
MISC--: importantly schwartz et al citation found considerable stable individual differences people s dispositional tendency use either good enough strategy maximizing strategy
MISC--: people either side this dispositional continuum been labeled satisficers maximizers respectively latter group expected more vulnerable problems arise excess choice
OWNX--: indeed various studies showed maximizers experience higher levels regret compared satisficers they show lower levels satisfaction decisions lower levels well being more generally
