MISC--: research shown people perceive themselves less biased than others better than average many favorable characteristics
MISC--: we suggest types biased perceptions regarding intentions behavior others may directly affect people s decisions
OWNX--: current research we focus possible influences context helping behavior
MISC--: four experiments we found people believe others compared themselves less inclined help cooperate less aware number bystanders more influenced proportion dominance bias identifiable victim effect
OWNX--: we demonstrate perceptions naive unrealistic showing decisions both self others perspectives equally biased
AIMX--: finally we show how perspective decision made self vs others may affect private well public decisions ways might not best interest decision maker public
MISC--: research judgment decision making recent decades shows because cognitive motivational biases individuals consistently rate themselves above average across variety domains positive traits citation behavior citation
MISC--: this bias known better than average bta effect
MISC--: example kruger dunning citation found participants self rating their ability judge humor solve logic grammar problems was higher than average
MISC--: they show this tendency stronger among those who perform more poorly
MISC--: bta belief been described illusory because group level majority people cannot better than average assuming normal distribution examined trait citation
MISC--: studies people typically compare their characteristics behaviors performance norm standard average standing their reference group
MISC--: bta bias greater when comparable target abstract average student declines when target individuated citation
MISC--: bta bias also salient people s evaluations judgments people believe their own judgments less susceptible biases than judgments others citation
MISC--: they tend view their own decisions relying objective cues environment while other s judgments influenced more subjective self serving features citation
MISC--: naive realism idea citation suggests people assume their own views ideas perceptions reflect truth real world when others do not share their views they tend conclude others views were subject bias misperceptions
MISC--: although bta bias may serve individual enhancing self esteem citation may negative effect decisions when decision depends belief about others behavior
MISC--: example believing mistakenly other people won t donate certain cause might increase my willingness donate even when i t afford
MISC--: other hand thinking other people will help relying their expected help may inhibit intervention result no help will provided
MISC--: perceptions what other people view best way act may influence decisions especially when involve public issues
MISC--: public well public decision makers prone same biases
MISC--: contrast private decisions decisions regarding public policy often taken politicians civil servants affect thousands individuals
OWNX--: cost bad decisions because biased perception citizens behavior attitudes opinions might very high
MISC--: moreover public decision makers politicians depend strongly public support one their main concerns when making decision public opinion how their decision will judged most people
MISC--: biased perceptions public opinion preferences choices may thus negatively affect behavior individuals public decision makers
MISC--: one domain perceptions others behavior judgments may critical influence one s own decisions decision act intervene situations when help needed
MISC--: individuals often exposed situations their personal help needed directly indirectly
MISC--: policy makers often consider policies require cooperation help public
MISC--: self other comparison not been studied this domain although most likely people s judgments decisions concerning helping behavior affected their perceptions others
MISC--: literature helping behavior bystander intervention emphasizes other people s behavior given situation considerable influence one s own decision whether not intervene
MISC--: not only people concerned about opinion others citation other people s behavior may also serve information regarding appropriate right thing do citation
MISC--: example when person monitors reactions others situation where help needed s he may conclude others lack initiative everyone believes intervention not critical thus not needed
OWNX--: person adopts what s he thinks norm behavior
MISC--: perceptions regarding others opinions behaviors accurate biased
MISC--: individuals may misperceive their social groups larger social environments number ways influence their behavior
MISC--: pluralistic ignorance one most common misperceptions
MISC--: occurs when majority individuals falsely assumes most their peers behave think differently them when fact their attitudes behavior similar citation
MISC--: pluralistic ignorance was suggested one explanation bystander effect individuals less likely offer help when other people present than when alone citation
MISC--: pluralistic ignorance may thus cause lack intervention case when help needed demonstrating how other people s opinions behavior may direct influence decision act not act
MISC--: another explanation bystander effect known diffusion responsibility
MISC--: this account lack intervention at least partially caused belief some people will act thus one s own action less necessary citation
MISC--: other people s behavior may greater influence one s own decisions situations more ambiguous unfamiliar citation
MISC--: recent research indicates idea how other people would act may influence decisions even without physical presence others
MISC--: blair thompson wuensch citation demonstrated diffusion responsibility phenomenon extends beyond face face environments virtual presence many others significantly reduced e mail responsiveness request help
MISC--: both explanations bystander effect based assumption people specific beliefs about perceptions others though there been no direct effort test assumptions
OWNX--: present experiment we directly test self perceptions participants well their perceptions others context helping behavior
MISC--: most people perceive helping others desirable behavior altruism superior characteristic
MISC--: thus according bta effect people expected perceive themselves more willing help than average person
OWNX--: present research we will examine bta effect also concerning biases context helping behavior intervention
MISC--: two biases recently been studied context proportion dominance pd bias identifiable victim idv effect
MISC--: do people perceive themselves less susceptible than others those two
MISC--: regard proportion dominance studies shown people prefer risk reducing intervention policy maximizes relative life saving saving larger proportion population at expense absolute life saving saving more lives citation
MISC--: those studies demonstrate people tend choose options maximize relative life saving even when presented comparison absolute relative savings citation
MISC--: this preference incompatible normative model according value single life should same regardless size reference group citation
MISC--: regard identified victim effect people more willing help identified victims victims about whom they some even if only minimal information than unidentified ones citation
MISC--: situations when decision help involves biases we expect decisions perspective self biased decisions average other people not aware bias
MISC--: however when confronted bias we assume bta mechanism will come into play resulting people believing others more biased than they themselves
MISC--: naive belief about others opposed oneself may cause decision makers choose alternative action not best their interest when behavior perceptions attitudes others relevant consideration often happens decisions concerning public policy
MISC--: thus sum we hypothesize people perceive themselves more willing help than average person at same time perceive others more prone biases context helping behavior than they
