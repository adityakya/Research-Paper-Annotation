MISC--: intrapersonal externality exists when individual s decisions affect outcomes her future decisions
MISC--: result decreasing increasing average returns rate consumption occurs addiction exercise
MISC--: experimentation using harvard game models intrapersonal externalities found differences decision making between drug users control subjects leading argument externalities influence course illicit drug use
MISC--: nevertheless unclear how participants who behave optimally conceptualise problem
OWNX--: we report two experiments using simplified harvard game tested differences contingency knowledge between participants who chose optimally participants who did not
MISC--: those who demonstrated optimal performance exhibited both pattern correct responses systematic errors questions about payoff schedules
MISC--: pattern suggested they learned explicit knowledge change reinforcement trail trial basis
OWNX--: they did not need full knowledge historical interaction leading each payoff
MISC--: we also found no evidence choice differences between participants who were given guaranteed payment participants who were paid contingent their performance but those given guaranteed payment were able report more contingency knowledge experiment progressed suggesting they explored more rather than settling into routine
OWNX--: experiment number showed using fixed inter trial interval did not change results
MISC--: experiments long suggested when humans make decisions they sometimes ignore even major consequences
MISC--: some situations consequences systematically ignored
MISC--: one situation intrapersonal externalities citation where changes utility options available future self not taken into account when making decision same way externalities economics refer situations consequences others not taken into account when individuals make decisions
MISC--: overlooked intrapersonal externalities lead under investment activities exhibit increasing average returns rate consumption example exercise becomes increasingly rewarding increased practice also positive effects how rewarding other life activities over investment activities exhibit decreasing average returns rate consumption use addictive substances becomes decreasingly rewarding increased use also negatively effects perceived rewards other life activities
MISC--: experiment reported herrnstein colleagues citation participants were presented repeated binary choice task using payoff schedules similar those shown figure number
MISC--: payoff each choice was determined proportion previous ten choices was allocated each option where choosing optimal long term option would lead lower immediate payoff but would slightly increase payoff both options over each next ten trials leading higher overall payoff
MISC--: conversely choosing optimal short term option would lead higher immediate payoff but would decrease payoff over next ten trials relative optimal option
MISC--: consistently choosing long term option ultimately leads highest payoff although any single trial short term option would give greatest number points
OWNX--: authors found most participants did not learn optimise their behaviour choosing instead option greatest short term payoff
MISC--: herrnstein vaughan citation suggested choices made according principle melioration global rate reinforcement ignored
MISC--: not new postulate addicts do not fully take into account internalities although past models generally used hyperbolic time discounting theoretical reason inconsistent preferences citation
MISC--: nevertheless ecological validity intrapersonal externalities was supported heyman dunn citation who found patients recovering drug clinics were more likely choose sub optimally than control participants suggesting addicts may worse than others taking into account full consequences their decisions
MISC--: further evidence link between intrapersonal externalities addictions come neuropsychological research found level prefrontal brain activity associated performance task citation
MISC--: this same area implicated studies using iowa gambling task citation related abuse various substances including alcohol stimulants citation
OWNX--: this suggests intervention at this behavioural level could effective reducing addictive behaviour if method were found improve decisions tasks involving intrapersonal externalities
MISC--: series laboratory experiments tried without success guide participants choose optimally
MISC--: warry remington sonuga barke citation attempted reduce motivation participants choose sub optimally reducing immediate differential between two options
OWNX--: they found this helped however end their experiment participants were still choosing around chance levels authors noted extrapolation their data suggested participants would reach asymptote at level was non optimal
MISC--: two experiments also attempted guide participants explicit understanding payoff schedules providing fairly explicit hint how participants could maximize their payoffs
OWNX--: herrnstein colleagues citation found choices were only briefly improved hint but soon returned sub optimal levels
MISC--: kudadjie gyamfi rachlin citation provided similar hint but found no corresponding improvement at all
MISC--: nevertheless tunney shanks citation showed participants could overcome sub optimal behaviour long they were given regular feedback about how their behaviour compared optimal outcome they were given around number number trials learn schedules
OWNX--: this suggests suboptimal choices harvard game not stable decision making bias but rather due failure fully learn payoff schedules
MISC--: normally experiments studying intrapersonal externalities participants choices either affect number points gained citation number choices remaining until end experiment citation
MISC--: however stillwell tunney citation modified schedules so both number points gained number choices remaining until end experiment were affected participants choices
OWNX--: this allowed two outcomes each decision separated so immediate effects were visible through number points gained each trial number choices remaining until end experiment decreased at differing rates depending upon participant s history choices
MISC--: other words choosing myopically led earning high payoffs through experiment but ultimately experiment ended prematurely participant lost opportunity earn further payoffs
MISC--: separating consequences each decision made outcomes each decision more easily discernible so participants learned choose optimally much earlier than previous experiments
MISC--: this also hints suboptimal behaviour task failure fully understand payoff schedules
MISC--: nature outcomes choices made may not so easily divided into separate simple categories
MISC--: so if results laboratory intrapersonal externality experiments useful understanding suboptimal decision making occurs addictions process whereby participants learn choose optimally simpler version needs understood
MISC--: one process could result conscious insight into payoff schedules participants able report
MISC--: this mirrors research into iowa gambling task found participants were able explicitly report their understanding task citation
MISC--: present experiments attempted test explicit knowledge payoff schedules find out what participants who behave optimally able report about payoff schedules
MISC--: experiments tested participants knowledge asking series questions designed cover every scenario task
MISC--: they used quantitative test participants understanding been shown more sensitive than qualitative tests citation
MISC--: experiments also tested whether making participants payment contingent number points they gained during task had effect their choices
MISC--: particularly economics literature seen crucial incentivize participants this way citation
MISC--: participants contingent condition were paid based number points they earned whereas those certain condition were paid fixed amount
MISC--: possible giving points contingent payments could cause participants more motivation thus gain more points participants would not explore fully they would otherwise so would settle suboptimal strategy leading fewer points citation
CONT--: if however not motivation failure leads poor performance experiments using intrapersonal externalities but rather cognitive failure understand payoff schedules then difference might not expected
