MISC--: magical beliefs about contagion via contact citation may emerge when people overgeneralize real world mechanisms contamination beyond their appropriate boundaries citation
MISC--: do people similarly overextend knowledge airborne contamination mechanisms
BASE--: previous work shown very young children believe merely being close contamination source contaminate item citation we asked whether this same hyper avoidant intuition also reflected adults judgments
OWNX--: two studies we measured adults ratings desirability object had made contact source contamination object nearby had made no contact contaminant object far away had also made no contact
MISC--: adults showed clear proximity effect wherein objects near contamination source were perceived less desirable than those far away even though separate group adults unanimously acknowledged contaminants could not possibly made contact either nearby far away object study number
OWNX--: proximity effect also remained robust when third group adults was explicitly told no contaminating particles had made contact objects at any time study number
OWNX--: we discuss implications our findings extending scope magical contagion effects beyond contact principle understanding persistence intuitive theories despite broad acceptance science based theories constraining interpretations developmental work proximity beliefs
MISC--: people often resist reconciling their intuitive beliefs about world more recently learned theories uncovered science
MISC--: example people may intuitively cling belief catching cold directly caused exposure cold temperatures
MISC--: although scientific research revealed alternative mechanisms e g rhinovirus transmission come broadly accepted lay public people may nonetheless behave accordance their initial belief
BASE--: real world perspective our intuitive theories critical examine because although they often irrational unsupported science they still strongly influence our behaviors citation
MISC--: instance people s excessive avoidance aids patients despite explicit knowledge hiv cannot transmitted via casual contact partially fueled non scientific intuitive theories contamination citation
MISC--: general irrational magical beliefs may emerge when people s core intuitive knowledge assumptions about major domains citation inappropriately overgeneralized other domains situations citation
MISC--: example beliefs about contamination correct within biological domain overextended psychological domain yielding behaviors consistent belief socially disliked person somehow transmit undesirable properties onto objects he she touches citation
MISC--: perhaps most well known overextensions domain knowledge magical contagion effect adults wherein people permanently reject objects had come into even brief innocuous contact aversive source citation
MISC--: example adults rejected thoroughly washed sweater worn homeless person citation juice touched sterilized cockroach citation
MISC--: instances there no real danger contamination citation yet even when any physical justification rejection removed e g via washing sterilization people continue reject contacted object
MISC--: studies rozin colleagues demonstrated modern adults adherence several key features anthropologically historically documented magical law contagion citation fundamentally states objects once contact always contact
MISC--: first people behave though physical contact critical undesirable properties transmitted second contagion characterized dose insensitivity even briefest most negligible contact believed transmit substantial amount undesirable properties then transmitted other objects third contagion characterized relative permanence believed persist long time after contact ceased impervious washing sterilization citation
MISC--: rozin colleagues thereby clearly argued showed contact central characteristic magical contagion effect citation
OWNX--: current studies we asked whether adults also adhere magical beliefs about contamination nearby sources even complete absence contact proximity effect henceforth
MISC--: given absence contact proximity effect conceptually distinct magical law contagion once contact always contact
MISC--: theory existence proximity effect highly plausible if classic magical contagion effect driven overgeneralization real world contamination mechanisms previously argued citation
MISC--: proximity effect if obtained could readily construed overextension known mechanisms airborne contamination situations clearly impossible
MISC--: there some prior evidence very young children behave though item contaminated just being near contaminant citation
MISC--: one developmental study example springer belk citation told children one several stories about boy who drank glass juice
MISC--: their physical contact story bug first fell into juice was removed their proximity story bug was near juice but never made contact
CONT--: most number number year olds their study rejected juice only physical contact story
MISC--: contrast significant portion number number year olds their study also rejected juice proximity story demonstrating proximity effect
MISC--: given this apparent developmental shift between age groups showing proximity effect researchers generally attributed effect insufficient knowledge magical thinking very young children suggesting may reflect ignorance real world mechanisms contamination citation
MISC--: indeed there been little no evidence suggest otherwise experiments proximity effect rarely been attempted adults who presumably know correct mechanisms contamination
MISC--: if even most minimal contact source was clearly completely eliminated would adults still behave though contamination occurs
MISC--: whether adults show overextension knowledge about airborne contamination open question
MISC--: one possibility adulthood naive radically inaccurate theories contamination been edited replaced more scientifically grounded theories
MISC--: alternatively intuitions may run deeply persistently only overridden specific learned cases bug juice scenarios
MISC--: example older children adults may repeatedly encountered bug juice scenarios real life explicitly learned accept juice proximal contaminant despite their intuitions
OWNX--: our study we used scenarios even adults would not encounter frequently thereby increasing our ability measure their intuitive unpracticed responses
MISC--: previously only toyoma citation reported preliminary evidence proximity effect both children adults using verbally described scenarios child came upon glass found had contaminant e g roach either inside next glass
MISC--: however study was very ambiguous whether contact contaminant had ever occurred before child s encounter them e g live roach could crawled anywhere prior moment making perfectly reasonable reject glass
MISC--: this critical problem given work dose insensitivity principle citation repeatedly shown even briefest tiniest point contact still treated contact following magical law contagion
MISC--: therefore remains unknown whether adults would show true proximity effect they reject item while believing its contamination was physically impossible
MISC--: similarly studies using chain contagion tasks cannot construed definitive tests proximity effect
MISC--: tasks clean pencil touched contaminant second clean pencil then touched first pencil so total number pencils contamination judgments made each pencil chain citation
OWNX--: studies showed adults judgments contamination decrease moving down chain never come close zero
OWNX--: however this paradigm contact clearly occurred at each point chain
MISC--: therefore contamination beliefs about second pencil explained second pencil made physical contact now contaminated first pencil magical law contagion allowed first pencil transmit contagion
OWNX--: adults judgments this task thereby demonstrated adherence magical law contagion its principles e g physical contact dose insensitivity permanence but task does not constitute clear test proximity effect
MISC--: finally well known study wherein people rejected fudge shaped look like feces citation cannot reasonably reinterpreted having shown proximity effect
OWNX--: although no contact contaminant was involved study paradigm neither was effect proximity contaminant tested
MISC--: study there was no contaminant object could proximal
MISC--: rozin et al citation instead designed fudge resembling feces study test conceptually distinct anthropologically documented law sympathetic magic known law similarity holds appearance reality e g if looks like feces must also share some other properties feces
MISC--: accordingly this study demonstrates modern adults adhere law similarity but does not indeed was never intended address magical law contagion once contact always contact possibility proximity effect
OWNX--: thus new investigation was needed clearly test proximity effect
OWNX--: current studies we used vignettes we pre tested ensure was clear contact contaminants had never occurred
OWNX--: we modified rozin colleagues well known paradigm they asked participants rate desirability having contact objects had previously had contact different sources
MISC--: current work departed clearly rozin colleagues task participants rated desirability having contact objects had been varying degrees proximity different sources
OWNX--: contact aversive source was eliminated critical conditions measure effect proximity
