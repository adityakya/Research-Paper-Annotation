OWNX--: three experiments investigated relations between buyers wealth ability pay atp sellers first offers
MISC--: study number demonstrated positive correlation between sellers first offers their perceptions buyer s atp well its real economic power indicated company s market value
MISC--: study number sellers field experiment made higher offers potential buyers higher atp
OWNX--: study number examined relations between buyer s atp perception its ability obtain alternatives specific deal sellers first offers
OWNX--: we found positive correlation between sellers perception buyers atp real atp indicated market value sellers perception buyers availability alternatives
MISC--: study number here too unit analysis was behavior individual participant
OWNX--: however when sellers were primed concentrate buyers alternatives their first offers were negatively related perceived buyer s alternatives
MISC--: every negotiation must start first offer one negotiating parties
MISC--: first offers determine process outcomes negotiations citation affecting both counteroffers settlement prices citation through process anchoring adjustment citation
MISC--: but although first offers become important research subject recent years citation one simple question not been fully answered how do initiators decide amount their first offer
MISC--: research indicates negotiators focus various cues reference points when deciding amount their first offer
MISC--: main reference points include market prices citation reservation prices citation aspiration prices citation own counterpart s alternatives citation
CONT--: several cues might not readily accessible negotiators might exert some even considerable effort find identify them
MISC--: other hand easily available cues counterpart s reputation prestige power status not been investigated potential determinants initial offers
MISC--: one important variable counterpart s wealth ability pay atp
MISC--: current article focuses this variable determinant amount first offer
OWNX--: common sense wisdom might lead us predict positive correlation between counterpart s perceived atp first offer will presented him her
MISC--: negotiators will make higher offers wealthy counterparts because they believe greater resources wealthy afford pay more
MISC--: common wisdom suggests this may indeed case contractor will charge more fixing your roof if you live upscale neighborhood namely you considered high atp lawyers charge higher fees richer costumers same mechanical repair will cost you more if you drive expensive car signals high atp
MISC--: legal settings there widely held belief jurors tend award higher compensation deep pocket defendants
OWNX--: other hand though high atp involves plentiful resources also characterized attributes likely make counterpart less willing accept high offer leading negative atp effect first offers
MISC--: there two main reasons this opposite effect
OWNX--: first solid economic basis high atp negotiators enables them better search their environment consequently find better deals than one offered
MISC--: second if sellers believe wealthier buyers willing pay more than possible more sellers would approach high atp buyers
OWNX--: taken together two reasons suggest high atp negotiators more alternatives given deal therefore their batna best alternative negotiated agreement would better than batna low atp negotiators
OWNX--: better batna high atp negotiators less inclined accept high offers
MISC--: somewhat parallel reasoning evident legal settings
OWNX--: one hand jurors might biased against wealthy defendants who afford pay award them higher compensation
MISC--: however deep pockets more resources fight back citation
MISC--: case tort law deep pockets might pay out many more claims so they will tend fight harder individual lawsuit
MISC--: though considering counterparts viewpoint negotiation setting particularly their alternatives present deal often recommended negotiators citation information about counterpart s alternatives often unavailable
MISC--: counterpart s wealth therefore its ability pay atp other hand typically more available more visible than its alternatives its batna so becomes dominant
MISC--: we know decision makers tend pay attention single dominant dimension attribute objects they judge citation
MISC--: examples this behavior prominence effect namely tendency focus solely most important most prominent attribute citation halo effect namely tendency construct global impressions basis single trait base subsequent judgments overall impressions citation
OWNX--: thus because atp more ready cue than availability alternatives context negotiation we expect positive atp effect counterpart s first offers
MISC--: sum this article focuses straightforward question do sellers make different first offers same products services when dealing costumers different economic resources
OWNX--: though this question simple far we know not been empirically examined
OWNX--: this article aims fill this gap investigating relation between counterpart s economic wealth therefore its atp first offers negotiation
OWNX--: first two studies provide lab field tests this prediction
