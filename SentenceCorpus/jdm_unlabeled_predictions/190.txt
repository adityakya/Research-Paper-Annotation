MISC--: anchoring effects assimilation numerical estimates previously considered standards highly robust
MISC--: two studies examined whether mood expertise jointly moderate magnitude anchoring
MISC--: previous research demonstrated happy mood induces judges process information less thorough manner than sad mood means happy judges tend more susceptible unwanted influences
CONT--: however this may not true anchoring effects
MISC--: because anchoring results elaborate process selective knowledge activation more thorough processing should lead more anchoring result sad judges should show stronger anchoring effects than happy judges happy judges may even remain uninfluenced given anchors
CONT--: because information processing experts may relatively independent their mood however mood may influence anchoring only non experts
MISC--: results two studies legal decision making study number numeric estimates study number consistent expectations
MISC--: findings suggest at least non experts positive mood may eliminate otherwise robust anchoring effect
MISC--: human judgment shaped affective influences
MISC--: how people judge evaluate given target critically depends how they feel citation
MISC--: judges mood example influences how they judge their own lives citation other persons citation frequency risks citation
MISC--: effects might occur because judges tend use their mood information judgment process citation
MISC--: however moods influence human judgments not only because they used directly information but also because they exert more indirect influence changing how judges process information
MISC--: particular judges who happy mood tend process information more superficial heuristic manner whereas those sad mood tend process information more thoroughly citation
MISC--: example judges happy mood rely more use stereotypes citation other heuristic strategies citation than judges sad mood citation
MISC--: extent use heuristic strategies leads judgmental biases citation findings suggest happy judges typically less accurate more biased than sad judges
MISC--: however there appears at least one notable exception this rule judgmental anchoring
