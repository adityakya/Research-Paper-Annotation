MISC--: standard preference models consumer research assume people weigh add all attributes available options derive decision while there growing evidence use simplifying heuristics
MISC--: recently greedoid algorithm been developed citation model lexicographic heuristics preference data
OWNX--: we compare predictive accuracies greedoid approach standard conjoint analysis online study rating ranking task
CONT--: lexicographic model derived greedoid algorithm was better at predicting ranking compared rating data but overall achieved lower predictive accuracy hold out data than compensatory model estimated conjoint analysis
OWNX--: however considerable minority participants was better predicted lexicographic strategies
OWNX--: we conclude new algorithm will not replace standard tools analyzing preferences but boost study situational individual differences preferential choice processes
MISC--: how do customers choose abundance products modern retail outlets
MISC--: how many attributes do they consider how do they process them form preference
MISC--: questions theoretical well practical interest
MISC--: gaining insights into processes people follow while making purchase decisions will lead better informed decision theories
MISC--: at same time marketers interested more realistic decision models predicting market shares optimizing marketing actions example adapting products advertising materials consumers choice processes
MISC--: consumer research decision models based idea utility maximization predominate date expressed prevalent use weighted additive models derived conjoint analysis capture preferences citation
MISC--: at same time judgment decision making researchers propose alternative decision heuristics supposed provide psychologically more valid accounts human decision making gather evidence their use citation
MISC--: recently field judgment decision making been equipped new tool greedoid algorithm deduce lexicographic decision processes preference data developed independently yee et al citation kohli jedidi citation
OWNX--: we aim bring together two lines research comparing predictive performance lexicographic decision processes deduced new greedoid algorithm weighted additive models estimated full profile regression based conjoint analysis standard tool consumer research
AIMX--: we derive hypotheses theoretical framework adaptive decision making about when approach should better suited tool test them empirical study
