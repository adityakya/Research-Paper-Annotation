MISC--: many judgment analysis studies employ multiple regression procedures estimate importance cues
MISC--: some studies test significance regression coefficients order decide whether not specific cues attended judge decision maker
MISC--: this practice dubious because ignores type ii error
OWNX--: purposes this note number draw attention this issue specifically appears studies self insight number illustrate problem examples judgment literature number provide simple method calculating post hoc power regression analyses order facilitate reporting type ii errors when regression models used
MISC--: decades judgment analysts successfully used multiple regression model organizing cognitive principles underlying many types judgments variety contexts citation
MISC--: most often models depict individual judge decision maker combining multiple differentially weighted pieces information cues compensatory manner arrive at judgment
MISC--: further analyses portray those who acquired expertise judgment task applying their judgment model policy regular although less than perfect consistency
MISC--: ability linear regression models accurately reproduce expert judgments under various conditions been discussed detail citation
MISC--: if one accepts proposition people s judgments modeled though they multiple regression equations questions arise number how many available cues does individual use
MISC--: number how should number cues used determined
CONT--: too many researchers blindly apply statistical significance tests inform themin kind deterministic mannerwhether judges did did not attend specific cues
MISC--: if t test calculated cue s weight significant then cue counted being attended judge
CONT--: relying p values this way problem because values affected number cues number cases presented judge during task how well overall regression equation fits total set responses
OWNX--: this issue discussed this note organized follows first examples judgment literature reviewed illustrate existence problem
MISC--: second notation commonly used judgment analysts when describing regression procedures introduced
OWNX--: third using this notation method calculating post hoc power t tests regression coefficients based noncentral t distribution described
MISC--: fourth this method applied estimate number cases necessary statistical significance order illustrate how investigator s conclusions about number cues attended judgment task should informed considerations type ii error
MISC--: finally spss program performing calculations described provided appendix
