MISC--: most american respondents give irrational magical responses variety situations exemplify sympathetic magical laws similarity contagion
MISC--: most cases respondents aware their responses usually rejections fudge crafted look like dog feces food touched sterilized dead cockroach not scientifically justified but they willing avow them
OWNX--: we interpret this some sense heart over head
AIMX--: we report this study american adults undergraduates substantially less likely acknowledge magical effects when judgments involve money amount willing pay avoid unpleasant magical contact than they when using preference rating measures
OWNX--: we conclude head heart conflicts this type money tips balance towards former other words money makes mind less magical
MISC--: sympathetic magical thinking recognizably irrational most educated adults who show effects
OWNX--: participants often laugh at themselves almost apologize face face studies they acknowledge reluctance engage activities eating piece chocolate shaped look like dog feces drinking apple juice brand new bed pan wearing sweater had been previously worn someone aids after was sterilized heat drinking glass juice had previously been touched dead sterilized cockroach
MISC--: other situations exemplifications two laws sympathetic magic first described anthropologists around turn number th century citation
MISC--: two relevant laws contagion once contact always contact similarity like causes like appearance equals reality
MISC--: different weaker form law similarity involves simple association
MISC--: if two entities associated one negative properties then second may take some properties citation
MISC--: example object owned but never touched disliked person may take negative properties
MISC--: some cases applicability similarity association principles overlaps
MISC--: consider person who feels bad about wearing new sweater words convicted murderer written label inside neck rim
OWNX--: this could explained simply association between sweater negative connotations murderer similarity appearance reality words convicted murderer stand real thing person actually might owned worn sweater
MISC--: majority undergraduate other participants citation surprisingly willing acknowledge their feelings discomfort wide range magical scenarios
MISC--: although embarrassment would thought work against admissions participants seem sense this peculiar domain they license display their feelings
MISC--: among studies we done this combination expressed magical thinking overcoming embarrassment most clear cyanide studies citation
OWNX--: participants observed sugar commercial package was poured into two clean bottles
MISC--: they were then given two labels one saying sugar other saying sodium cyanide poison asked place one label each bottle they chose
MISC--: most participants subsequently showed more reluctance drink sugar water made bottle they had labeled cyanide even not sodium cyanide label
OWNX--: we suspect this willingness show rather silly if genuine response would curbed if stakes were higher example if money were at stake
MISC--: one might willing acknowledge silly magical feeling but not put money behind
AIMX--: studies described this paper test this idea questionnaire format
MISC--: identical magical scenarios described respondents indicate between subject design their feelings willingness pay avoid interaction magically degraded object
OWNX--: we also include data set same respondents make both types judgments at different periods time two months apart
