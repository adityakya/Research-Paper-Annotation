OWNX--: combining meaning memory development perennially popular topic intuition approached new way
MISC--: fuzzy trace theory integrates topics distinguishing between meaning based gist representations support fuzzy yet advanced intuition superficial verbatim representations information support precise analysis
MISC--: here i review counterintuitive findings led development theory its most recent extensions neuroscience risky decision making
MISC--: findings include memory interference worse verbatim memory associated better reasoning nonnumerical framing framing effects increase when numbers deleted decision problems developmental decreases gray matter increases brain connectivity developmental reversals memory judgment decision making heuristics biases based gist increase childhood adulthood challenging conceptions rationality selective attention effects provide critical tests comparing fuzzy trace theory expected utility theory its variants e g prospect theory
MISC--: surprising implications judgment decision making real life also discussed notably adaptive decision making relies mainly gist based intuition law medicine public health
MISC--: what cutting edge approaches judgment decision making will influential next decade
MISC--: hot topics today will turn into enduring foundational assumptions tomorrow
MISC--: questions concern new investigators they place bets their most precious commodity their time choosing topics hopes making impact field
MISC--: however although new investigators strive original forward thinking they also counseled conduct programmatic cumulative research
MISC--: make progress important topics scientists must build prior accomplishments their own those others
MISC--: this essay i provide overview recent developments one theory their origins prior scientific research
OWNX--: moreover topics were chosen view future
MISC--: my bets about approaches been productive gathering momentum
MISC--: fortunately prognostications more than simply my opinions barely more than perhaps because they based behavior community scholars
MISC--: ideas continue gain greater currency our field searches new paradigms preoccupations citation
MISC--: what topics i others believe taking off will continue progress
MISC--: among new trends most established topic one draws rich supply prior research memory
MISC--: researchers increasingly turning memory explanations judgment decision making citation
MISC--: memory much more than memorization i presently explain
MISC--: growing number contemporary theories memory common denominator citation
MISC--: development defined changes across lifespan another topic gained ground
MISC--: because links aging adolescent risk taking psychiatry public health neuroscience this topic surged popularity although less established within judgment decision making citation
MISC--: notwithstanding tversky kahneman citation drew piagetian cognitive illusions characterize heuristics biases citation theories adult judgment decision making only now incorporating developmental results their core assumptions
MISC--: developmental results inform conceptions whether choices rational adaptive good citation
OWNX--: results been surprising
MISC--: knowing children reason rationally classic sense adults forego rational reasoning they capable favor heuristics biases casts explanations judgment decision making entirely new light citation
MISC--: last topic meaning least established among new trends
MISC--: nevertheless concept meaning tremendous potential organize thinking about judgment decision making propel field forward new original directions effect practical changes real world behavior citation
MISC--: sunstein citation advises understanding meaning its malleabilitysuggests some tools policymakers might use p number he exhorts public private institutions employ meaning entrepreneurs move behavior better directions
OWNX--: combining meaning memory development perennially popular topic intuition approached new way
MISC--: fuzzy trace theory integrates topics distinguishing between meaning based memory representations gist superficial verbatim representations information
MISC--: people use their memories represent information even when information visible
MISC--: intuition this view relies meaning based gist representations but not developmentally primitive citation
MISC--: contrary intuitive thinking underlies most advanced thinking citation
MISC--: however intuition produces meaning based distortions memory reasoning
MISC--: distortions increase childhood adulthood creating developmental reversals citation
MISC--: findings were predicted framework described here citation but they violate core assumptions other dual process developmental theories citation
OWNX--: section below origins i describe how this integrated account meaning memory development came about
