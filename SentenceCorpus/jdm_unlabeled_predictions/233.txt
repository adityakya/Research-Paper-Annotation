MISC--: this study compares judgments fairness economic actions among survey populations switzerland both student non student groups people s republic china earlier kahneman knetsch thaler citation surveys canadians
OWNX--: findings suggest fairness concerns matter among all groups general patterns what was was not considered fair were similar
MISC--: however there were also some significant differences influence fairness being weaker two chinese samples than groups western countries influence being weakest chinese student population wage related topics
OWNX--: whole almost no significant gender differences were found any new surveys
MISC--: fairness concerns often play important role people s choices decisions
MISC--: we commonly observe people forgoing some opportunities maximize their own material well being out concern others adherence standards fairness
MISC--: evidence consistent this behaviour also been documented numerous studies involving both survey responses hypothetical scenarios citation decisions real monetary payoffs citation
CONT--: although there little empirical evidence one way other judgments fairness might well differ among different populations
MISC--: bicchieri citation suggests there no particular unique norm fairness but one several might invoked depending context
CONT--: even though there may broad consensus within given culture about how example goods opportunities should allocated distributed there may differences between them
MISC--: although past studies shown nature importance fairness concerns how people commonly respond unfair behaviour they nearly all been conducted western countries cultures
MISC--: very little evidence been reported fairness concerns eastern countries people s republic china
AIMX--: although bian keller citation reported survey responses some questions kkt chinese mba students shenhai comparing results one city china those usa infer between country differences might subject some criticism
MISC--: suggested oosterbeek et al citation within country differences same magnitude between country differences
MISC--: one purpose present study survey chinese respondents three cities their responses all four types fairness norms summarized kkt compare their judgments those people different cultures
MISC--: i choose canada switzerland p r
MISC--: china comparison using common methodology facilitate comparisons
MISC--: since this study based kkt canada used baseline besides because canadian survey citation was conducted over two decades ago provides limited comparison judgments over this time period switzerland chosen sample availability its having much more common canada than china terms culture level economic development
MISC--: further comparisons judgments also made between student non student populations china between male female respondents china switzerland
OWNX--: findings indicate fairness matters among all respondent groups generally similar ways
MISC--: there however some differences particularly between chinese respondents those both western countries
OWNX--: all studies were based survey responses same questions involving simple narrative vignettes used kkt their early telephone interview survey study fairness among canadian respondents
CONT--: questions allowed tests example extent people regarded wage cuts fair response market conditions when employers were were not making normal profits
MISC--: framing questions terms vignettes were similarly useful determining influence reference profits what was found important role reference transaction shaping people s judgments fairness often independent contrary traditional economic justifications particular actions
CONT--: this research extends growing empirical literature examines patterns people s fairness judgments much based not only methods but findings what people judged fair acceptable actions what they judged unfair kkt study
MISC--: frey et al citation example used questions similar those kkt study surveys german swiss populations
MISC--: their findings were much same terms respondents negative responses use price eliminate excess demand
MISC--: shiller boycko korobov citation investigated people soviet union united states some questions again similar those used kkt
OWNX--: some economically relatively minor differences similar patterns fairness judgments were found between soviet american respondents
MISC--: both groups respondents considered unfair increase price response sudden surge excess demand finding large consistent kkt findings
OWNX--: general findings representative surveys showed consistent results
CONT--: however although showing how people canada some other countries evaluate fairness various economic behaviours they limited western cultures were conducted some considerable time ago
MISC--: they provide little direct evidence how people other cultures might react similar questions given present interest particularly people p r
MISC--: china
MISC--: some related studies been carried out china but they used other methods populations
MISC--: example bian keller citation found judgments chinese business graduate students differed those random household sample canadians fairness exploiting added market power short term profit
CONT--: while interesting perhaps indicative possibility wider disparity difference between respondents may well limited particular sample population
MISC--: another study bian keller citation used different sample government business people ask about life death issues rather than about common economic behaviors while again interesting useful studies decisions special groups sample questions allow little comparability kkt present studies
MISC--: latter studies involved respondents more generally representative wider populations questions concerning fairness economic actions decisions intended protect profits exploit market power allocate gains depart previous reference transactions
MISC--: present study also contributes literature cross cultural investigation human fairness judgments citation providing some empirical evidence used test existing related theories
AIMX--: this present study china switzerland canada compared might differ political social economic cultural aspects
MISC--: due co existence political socioeconomic cultural differences between countries comparison attributing cross country difference cultural factor was challenged
MISC--: however chen tang citation provided some evidence culture s role affecting people s economic behavior might more significant than non cultural factors
OWNX--: order explore influence within country cultural difference they chose xiamen lhasa tibet china comparison used singapore control sample because its similarity culture xiamen heterogeneity political systems social institutions level economic development
MISC--: they found no significant differences people s behavior ultimatum game between xiamen singapore but people lhasa differed former two samples suggesting influence culture dominates non cultural factors
MISC--: thus considering cultural discrepancies between china western group two dimensions see table number including power distance individualism proposed hofstede citation culture expected play critical role affecting people s fairness judgments
MISC--: toc paragraph hypothesis number h number class paragraph sec anchor hypothesis number h number sec end chinese people people switzerland canada diverge fairness judgments some economic actions
MISC--: more chinese people judge same action fair than their counterparts
MISC--: hypothesis number formulated based mainly hofstede citation
MISC--: seen table number group switzerland canada china opposite sides along axis each index china higher score power distance index while lower score individualism index
MISC--: according hofstede citation large power distance indicates large extent less powerful members society within country accept power distributed unequally people generally accept fact power basic fact society antedate good evil its legitimacy irrelevant power holders entitled privileges citation
MISC--: similarly collectivism contrast high individualism associated norm interests group outweigh interests individuals group provides protection
CONT--: this study people whose actions judged all scenarios hold market power more less at same time most them represent interests organization group
MISC--: so theories power distance collectivism predict chinese would more willing accept decisions power holders groups supports hypothesis number
MISC--: however inglehart s citation two dimensions culture seem contradict each other conjecturing people s fairness judgments
MISC--: compared switzerland canada china evaluated less self expressing consistent hypothesis number but more secular thus should less likely defer authority
MISC--: this made me propose alternative hypothesis number
MISC--: toc paragraph hypothesis number b h number class paragraph sec anchor hypothesis number b h number sec end more chinese people judge same action unfair than their counterparts
MISC--: men women think behave differently many respects received much attention thus spurred studies gender differences
AIMX--: this study also examined whether gender affects people s judgments fairness marketplace three new surveys
MISC--: findings some gender studies judgments perceptions social preference fairness justice citation revealed males females might differ each other this respect
MISC--: fairness judgments example beldona namasivayam citation documented statistically significant differences where females perceived significantly less fairness across all pricing scenarios both discount surplus frames
MISC--: so i expect gender differences exist
MISC--: toc paragraph hypothesis number h number class paragraph sec anchor hypothesis number h number sec end male female respondents differ their fairness judgments each three surveys
AIMX--: this paper organized follows
OWNX--: following section paper describes nature surveys carried out china switzerland
