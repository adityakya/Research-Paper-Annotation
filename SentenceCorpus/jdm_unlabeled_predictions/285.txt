MISC--: petersburg paradox famous economic philosophical puzzle generated numerous conflicting explanations
OWNX--: shed empirical light this phenomenon we examined subjects bids one st
MISC--: petersburg gamble real monetary payment
OWNX--: we found bids were typically lower than twice smallest payoff thus much lower than generally supposed
OWNX--: we also examined bids offered several hypothetical variants st
MISC--: petersburg paradox
OWNX--: we found bids were weakly affected truncating gamble were strongly affected repeats gamble depended linearly initial seed value gamble
OWNX--: one explanation we call median heuristic strongly predicts data
OWNX--: subjects following this strategy evaluate gamble if they were taking median rather than mean payoff distribution
OWNX--: finally we argue distribution outcomes embodied st
MISC--: petersburg paradox so divergent gaussian form statistical mean poor estimator expected value so expected value st
MISC--: petersburg gamble undefined
MISC--: results suggest this classic paradox straightforward explanation rooted use statistical heuristic

MISC--: petersburg paradox originally proposed number house offers flip coin until comes up heads
MISC--: house pays number if heads appears first trial otherwise payoff doubles each time tails appears this compounding stopping payment being given at first heads bernoulli number shown figure number
