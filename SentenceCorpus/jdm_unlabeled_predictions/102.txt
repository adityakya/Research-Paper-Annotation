CONT--: according time saving bias drivers underestimate time saved when increasing low speed overestimate time saved when increasing relatively high speed
OWNX--: previous research used specific type task drivers were asked estimate time saved when increasing speed give numeric response show this
CONT--: present research conducted two studies multiple questions show time saving bias occurs other tasks
CONT--: study number found drivers committed time saving bias when asked estimate time saved when increasing speed b distance completed at given time when increasing speed c speed required complete given distance decreasing times
OWNX--: study number showed no major differences estimations time saved compared estimations remaining journey time also between responses given numeric scale versus visual analog scale
CONT--: study number tested two possible explanations time saving bias proportion heuristic differences heuristic
OWNX--: some evidence was found use latter
MISC--: if you need complete number km journey how much time would take at mean speed number kph
MISC--: most people would find easy answer question number km at number kph takes half hour number minutes
CONT--: but what if you wanted increase speed order reduce journey time
MISC--: how much time would you save if you increase your speed number kph number number kph
MISC--: many people consistently give wrong answers questions
MISC--: several studies shown people underestimate time saved when increasing relatively low speed overestimate time saved when increasing relatively high speed citation
