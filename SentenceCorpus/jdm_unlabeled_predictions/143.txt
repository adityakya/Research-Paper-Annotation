OWNX--: this paper develops tests independence stationarity choice data collected small samples
MISC--: method builds approach smith batchelder citation
OWNX--: technique intended distinguish cases where person systematically changing true preferences one group trials another cases person following random preference mixture model independently identically distributed sampling each trial
MISC--: preference reversals counted between all pairs repetitions
MISC--: variance preference reversals between all pairs repetitions then calculated
OWNX--: distribution this statistic simulated monte carlo procedure data randomly permuted statistic recalculated each simulated sample
MISC--: second test computes correlation between mean number preference reversals difference between replicates also simulated monte carlo
OWNX--: data regenwetter dana davis stober citation reanalyzed this method
MISC--: eight number subjects showed significant deviations independence assumptions one both tests significantly more than expected chance
MISC--: regenwetter dana davis stober citation proposed solution problem testing whether choice data satisfy violate transitivity preference
MISC--: their probabilistic choice model assumes given trial response represented if were random sample mixture transitive preferences
OWNX--: model was used analyze replication tversky s citation study had reported systematic violations transitivity preference citation
OWNX--: reanalysis via this iid mixture model new data concluded transitivity retained
OWNX--: birnbaum citation agreed much their paper including their conclusions evidence against transitivity weak but criticized method part because assumes responses same person repeated choices independent identically distributed iid
MISC--: if this assumption violated method regenwetter et al citation might lead wrong conclusions regarding tests structural properties
MISC--: further violations assumptions analyzed more detailed analysis individual responses choice problems rather than focusing averaged binary choice proportions
MISC--: true error model rival probabilistic representation also used test structural properties transitivity mixture models iid will violated when person mixture true preferences changes true preferences during course study
MISC--: birnbaum citation showed how regenwetter et al method might lead wrong conclusions when iid violated hypothetical data described methods testing between two rival stochastic models choice
MISC--: methods allow tests assumptions regenwetter et al citation approach against violations would occur if person were change preferences during study
MISC--: he described conventional statistical tests require conventional sized samples
MISC--: hypothetical examples illustrated cases method regenwetter et al citation might lead conclusion transitivity was satisfied even when more detailed analysis showed data contained systematic violations both iid transitivity
CONT--: methods described birnbaum citation test independence would require large numbers trials however might difficult impractical implement
MISC--: experiment tversky citation regenwetter et al citation replicated does not sufficient data allow full analyses proposed birnbaum citation
MISC--: regenwetter dana davis stober guo citation argued would difficult collect enough data provide complete test all iid assumptions proposed birnbaum citation
MISC--: nevertheless this note shows building approach smith batchelder citation possible test iid assumptions even small studies regenwetter et al citation
