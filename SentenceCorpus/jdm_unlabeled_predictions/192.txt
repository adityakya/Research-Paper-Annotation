AIMX--: we perform experimental investigation using dictator game individuals must make moral decision give not give amount money poor people third world
OWNX--: questionnaire subjects asked about reasons their decision shows at least this case moral motivations carry heavy weight decision majority dictators give money reasons consequentialist nature
MISC--: based results presented here other analogous experiments we conclude dicator behavior understood terms moral distance rather than social distance systematically deviates egoism assumption economic models game theory
MISC--: standard dictator game dg experiments one players dictator given fixed amount money set instructions
MISC--: instructions explain money been assigned two players dictator recipient but only dictator entitled decide how much money keep how much money give recipient
MISC--: this simple situation there at least three sources information relevant decision i information related dictator herself i e whether not decision observed others ii information dictator receives about recipient iii information derived game framing language used instructions
MISC--: previous papers shown outcome dg changes considerably depending type information provided experimenters
OWNX--: instance when dictator makes decision under conditions absolute privacy anonymity no information about recipient nearly no one donates anything
MISC--: donations tend very low around number percent pie average citation
MISC--: however when dictator receives reliable information regarding recipient even while keeping anonymity constant donations increase
MISC--: when no information available about recipient dictator may doubts recipient s existence therefore no reason share money
MISC--: contrast when dictators were shown pictures recipients particular experiment up number percent subjects gave much half total amount although number percent them kept all money themselves citation
MISC--: another experiment dictators were told their donation would given red cross citation
OWNX--: thirty one percent dictators this experiment gave part money number percent gave half amount while number percent gave full amount
MISC--: offers also increased when dictators were told recipient s surname citation when they received proof actual existence recipients when they were told recipient was fellow classmate citation
MISC--: experiments shown if conditions anonymity relaxed e g dictator s behavior relevant information about recipients revealed donations will higher although full amount money will never donated exception red cross experiment
MISC--: language used instructions yet another factor may determine outcome experiment
MISC--: example fact subjects told they participating experiment may make them lose interest their partner may cause subjects feel they playing game competition they must therefore win keep all part money themselves citation
MISC--: nature payments presence absence experimenters possibility taking part future experiments thus winning more money may also determine outcome citation
MISC--: aim experiments measure prosocial conduct other regarding preferences revealed subjects thus challenging assumption self interested behavior
MISC--: supposition individuals will attempt maximize their own benefits standard assumption economics could lead conclusion no one will give anything dg since giving nothing behavior maximizes dictator material s payoff
OWNX--: however we seen subjects often deviate this prediction laboratory setting
MISC--: light experimental results several hypotheses been developed explain deviations
MISC--: hoffman et al citation show anonymity relaxed donations increase
MISC--: opinion authors this due fact anonymity generates social distance they define degree reciprocity subjects believe exists within social interaction citation
MISC--: social isolation lack sense community produced anonymity leads predominance self interested behavior
MISC--: nonetheless hypothesis social distance been widely criticized
MISC--: concept reciprocity example employed very broad sense since reality dg does not pose so much problem reciprocity recipient do nothing one subject identifiability
MISC--: indeed identifiability determines behavior citation
MISC--: many experiments shown not so much degree dictator anonymity determines donations but rather information dictator about recipient
MISC--: thus example extensive article several hypotheses reviewed explain donations dictator games others proposed bolton et al citation argue if i know nothing about other person if i give her money i err her favor but i prefer err my favor because i am not saint i m no saint hypothesis
MISC--: according authors however hypotheses explain dg donations unclear when dictator information about recipient
MISC--: should noted bolton et al citation do not find evidence what they call kindness hypothesis according dictators might motivated give gift one more many reasons e g sense moral obligation pleasure derived giving demonstrate kindness number
OWNX--: this hypothesis however encompasses very distinct motivations must analyzed separately
MISC--: although pleasures giving demonstrating kindness greatly affected anonymity recipient not knowing if dictator gives not takes away pleasure giving does not allow dictator demonstrate she kind moral obligation not affected anonymity but rather lack information about recipient s actual situation
MISC--: classic hoffman et al citation experiment most experiments along lines complete lack information about recipient removes necessary conditions donate out sense moral obligation if eckel grossman shown altruistic behavior requires appropriate context inexistent most experiments what would happen if dictator makes decision easily recognizable moral context context dictators information example about their partner s poverty illness
OWNX--: eckel grossman s experiment partner red cross donations increase but not spectacular way
MISC--: donations increase much more when money dictator distribute result joint effort both dictator partner given this case social pressures moral imperatives warm glow giving likely magnify reward skillful deserving recipients citation
MISC--: ruffle points out results this experiment contradict hoffman et al s claim other regarding preferences do expectations phenomenon not autonomous private preference equity citation
MISC--: moral preferences sense moral obligation moral imperatives equity appear repeatedly discussions outcomes diverse range dg experiments
OWNX--: yet spite fact donations occur experiments we cannot speak any certainty about dictators reasons giving only thing we know sure preference been revealed decision whether dictator gave did not give
OWNX--: indeed aside theoretical speculations experimenters we do not know why dictators give
OWNX--: view bridging this gap following section we present two experiments hypothetical one real payoffs one moral context easily recognizable dictators expressly asked about reasons their action
OWNX--: we then determine if kindness hypothesis some degree certain either because dictators take pleasure giving give demonstrate kindness give out sense moral obligation
