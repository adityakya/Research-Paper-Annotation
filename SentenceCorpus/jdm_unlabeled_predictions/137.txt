AIMX--: this paper we document violation normative descriptive models decision making under risk
OWNX--: contrast uncertainty effects found gneezy list wu citation some subjects our experiments valued lotteries more than best possible outcome
OWNX--: we show overbidding effect more strongly related individuals competitiveness traits than comprehension lottery s payoff mechanism
MISC--: decision making often involves choices between risky outcomes
MISC--: prospect theory expected utility theory both posit individuals balance outcomes their potentially weighted probability occurrence means certainty equivalent binary lottery will lie somewhere between lowest highest outcomes
MISC--: however gneezy list wu citation document cases where individuals value risky prospect less than its worst possible realization
OWNX--: they call this phenomenon uncertainty effect demonstrate its existence various laboratory experiments including real hypothetical pricing tasks inter temporal choice tasks well field experiment sportscard market
OWNX--: uncertainty effect however disappears within subject designs observed only lotteries do not involve cash
MISC--: gneezy list wu citation study sparked small but growing literature examining robustness their findings
MISC--: example sonsino citation found occurrence uncertainty effect internet based within subject design
MISC--: keren willemsen citation argued however gneezy list wu s citation results were artifact poorly understood experimental instructions
MISC--: specifically series experiments they replaced lottery coin toss spinner wheel clearly define payoff probabilities
MISC--: they also added comprehension checks
MISC--: their new protocols eliminated uncertainty effect almost completely
MISC--: similarly rydval et al citation used physical lottery formats i e drawing good gift exchange deferred payment closed bag containing two goods identical except their face value instead verbal lottery descriptions observed uncertainty effect almost disappeared
MISC--: other hand simonsohn citation argued uncertainty effect neither caused fact gneezy list wu s citation manipulation uncertainty was fully confounded number outcomes presented subjects nor subjects may had erroneously believed lottery could result payment number
MISC--: instead he argued uncertainty effect occurs consequence direct risk aversion
MISC--: direct risk aversion arises literal distaste uncertainty i e uncertainty enters directly into people s utility function
MISC--: theoretically gill stone citation showed uncertainty effect arise tournaments where two agents competing win fixed monetary prize
MISC--: similarly andreoni sprenger citation argued uncertainty effect not anomalous if certain uncertain consumption evaluated different utility parameters
MISC--: they argue marginal utility uncertain consumption diminishes more quickly than marginal utility certain consumption
MISC--: because uncertain utility more concave than certain utility one expect gamble valued less than its worst possible outcome
AIMX--: this paper we document cases polar opposite uncertainty effect found gneezy list wu citation where individuals value outcome risky prospect more than its best possible realization
OWNX--: we demonstrate cases where subjects willing pay much three times value best possible realization lottery second price auction
OWNX--: we term this effect overbidding effect
OWNX--: addition documenting overbidding effect we seek identify causes effect
CONT--: three non exclusive possible explanations results we observe number confusion about auction mechanism number confusion failure comprehension about lotteries i e subjects did not understand payoff mechanism lottery number subjects derive utility winning being top dog experiment i e walk out experiment top dog among their peers citation
OWNX--: regarding first two issues plott zeiler citation show often reported wtp wta disparity likely result subjects confusion elicitation mechanism suggesting wtp wta divergence not underlying feature preference per se but rather result misunderstanding bidding mechanism
MISC--: tempting attribute overbidding effect elements value elicitation mechanism
MISC--: example kagel levin s citation non risky induced value experiments subjects tended slightly overbid second price auction
MISC--: experiments subjects assigned value v winner auction paid difference between his her value second highest bid price profit v price
MISC--: second price auction individual s weakly dominant strategy submit bid equal v but kagel levin show many people submit bids higher than v
MISC--: kagel levin citation attributed overbidding either dominant bidding strategy not being transparent weak learning feedback mechanisms second price sealed bid auction
OWNX--: although this result often taken stylized fact associated second price auctions lusk shogren citation document several more recent induced value studies focus all bidders values not just market price tend find behaviour more line theoretical predicted bidding behaviour second price auction
BASE--: even if we accept kagel levin s citation result over bidding second price auction difficult conclude this primary cause behaviour observed here lotteries where subjects values v unknown
OWNX--: although subjects our experiments overbid we would expect people s bids lie somewhere close expected payoff not close maximum payoff lottery
MISC--: stated differently overbidding effect observed kagel levin citation might explain bids slightly higher than expected value lottery but cannot explain bids excess maximum lottery payout
OWNX--: we use experimental design varied amount training about auction mechanism amount feedback after each round
OWNX--: varying amount training allows us directly test whether confusion elicitation mechanism may explain observed results
MISC--: other hand amount feedback after each round allows us test whether mechanism may induced more competitiveness sessions
OWNX--: we also measured subject s personal traits regarding comprehension how lotteries work well their competitiveness
OWNX--: our results suggest overbidding effect small part attributed comprehension how lotteries work but extensive training second price auction does not eliminate overbidding effect thus ruling out confusion elicitation mechanism primary cause overbidding
OWNX--: we find comprehension negatively related overbidding effect while competitiveness traits positively related overbidding behavior
OWNX--: this paper structured follows next section discusses design our auction experiments followed data analysis results
