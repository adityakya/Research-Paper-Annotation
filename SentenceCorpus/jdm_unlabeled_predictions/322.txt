MISC--: history judgment decision making defined trend toward increasingly nuanced explanations decision making process
MISC--: recently process models become incredibly sophisticated yet tools available directly test models not kept pace
MISC--: increasingly complex process models require increasingly complex process data they adequately tested
OWNX--: we propose new class data collection will facilitate evaluation sophisticated process models
MISC--: tracking mouse paths during continuous response provides implicit measure growth preference produces choice rather than current practice recording just button press indicates choice itself
MISC--: recent research cognitive science citation shown cognitive processing revealed dynamic motor responses
CONT--: unlike current process methodologies response dynamics studies demonstrate continuous competition between choice options even online preference reversals
AIMX--: here order demonstrate mechanics utility methodology we present example response dynamics experiment utilizing common multi alternative decision task
MISC--: past few decades seen notable change level analysis characterizing theories models decision making
MISC--: generally paramorphic models concerned largely outcome prediction giving way computational models focus processes assumed produce responses citation
MISC--: this focus underlying cognitive processes enabled explanations paradoxes e g decoy compromise effects within unified frameworks citation rather than increasingly complex algebraic functions divorced cognitive operations
OWNX--: this theoretical shift demands accompanying empirical methodologies order evaluate more precisely specified process theories
MISC--: example tracking information search acquisition during decision tasks developed use information boards citation mouse tracking techniques citation eye tracking techniques citation
MISC--: other methods think aloud protocols response time analyses citation been used clever combinations several methodologies together provide converging evidence citation
OWNX--: here we would like introduce what we consider next important logical step this important methodological evolution our field tracking response dynamics decision making
MISC--: shortcoming inherent process tracing techniques identified above citation lies their neglect dynamic nature choice preferences
MISC--: process traced mouse eye tracking one information search not deliberation process itself utilizes this information verbal reports reflect subject s perception how they engaged task subject demand characteristics response times rt indicate how long task takes but not nature processing occurs during interval
MISC--: not say measures always uninformative many authors fruitfully applied rt analyses example infer characteristics decision process citation
OWNX--: however traditional metrics generally fail capture notion observed choices result dynamic process where evidence various response choice alternatives may accumulate over course task
OWNX--: rts specifically lack sufficient resolution explore this dynamic evolution preference real time
OWNX--: this deficiency quite serious given evidence accumulation assumption received extensive theoretical treatment neurophysiological support citation
MISC--: recently growing body research cognitive science citation utilized novel paradigm compensates deficiency current jdm methods identified above
MISC--: research response dynamics captures continuous online processing information revealed subject s motor response
MISC--: spivey dale citation describe theoretical basis representative mouse tracking applications this approach citation
MISC--: basic paradigm involves simply recording position mouse en route selection option decision task
MISC--: theoretical assumption competitive pull foregone alternatives exerts influence response trajectories there now substantial behavioral neurophysiological evidence citation
MISC--: therefore one measure properties response trajectory draw inferences about underlying mental processes
MISC--: goal current work introduce this research stream jdm community illustrate types analyses comparisons makes possible
MISC--: only other explicitly jdm application citation tracked mouse responses risky decision making task traditional economic gambles involving either gains losses highlighted ability describe changes direction strength preference online during task
MISC--: when choosing safe gamble realm gains subjects proceeded very directly gamble
MISC--: alternatively when they chose risky gamble they first proceeded towards safe gamble before rapidly changing direction towards risky gamble
MISC--: opposite pattern was generally true realm losses
MISC--: theoretically results support models allow momentary preference one option during task but ultimate choice other option e g dual process models sequential sampling models behavior would not captured existing discrete response methods
OWNX--: following demonstration study we show another application traditional jdm task iowa gambling task
AIMX--: we chose this task because its ubiquitous use experience based design allow us showcase utility response dynamics both within trial types e g following gain loss classified below across course task metric learning
MISC--: iowa gambling task citation traditionally been used diagnose decision making deficits individuals neurological damage
MISC--: subjects presented four decks cards each provides wins every draw occasional accompanying losses but they slightly different payout characteristics see figure number
MISC--: typically two decks hereafter b considered bad decks offering high rewards high punishments result net loss whereas two other decks c d good decks lower rewards but also lower more infrequent punishments citation resulting net gain
