MISC--: professional judges traffic courts sentence many hundreds offenders per year
OWNX--: using number case files archives we compared matching heuristic mh compensatory weighing algorithms wm
MISC--: we modeled cross validated models different subsets data took several other methodological precautions allowing each model select optimal number variables ordering weighing variables accordance different logics
OWNX--: we did not reproduce finding dhami citation who found mh superior compensatory algorithm modeling bail granting decisions
OWNX--: simulations brought out inner logic two family models showing what combination parameters works best
MISC--: remains remarkable using only fraction variables combining them non compensatorily mh obtained nearly good fit weighing method
AIMX--: this paper compares compensatory non conpensatory models descriptions how decisions made real life settings experienced practitioners
MISC--: study concerns traffic judges punishment they mete out alleged offenders brought their court
MISC--: judges traffic courts professional decision makers
MISC--: their decisions them routine they handle dozens cases every month
MISC--: defendants appearing court decisions significant involving sometimes hefty fines driving license suspension even prison
OWNX--: we asked how many elements traffic judges consider how complex their decision patterns
MISC--: study relying actual cases professional decision making contributes debate about plausibilitiy fast frugal heuristics psychological models cognition citation
MISC--: there extensive literature how decision makers proceed when they rely multiple cues come decision
MISC--: many researchers maintain decisions makers do not rely all information available combine any sophisticated way
MISC--: instead claimed they rely simple heuristics sometimes turn out surprisingly efficient valid more complex approaches favored rational analysis citation
AIMX--: this paper analyzes attempts model decisions made real life experienced traffic judges
CONT--: how simple how complex judgments meted out
OWNX--: do traffic judges consider all elements case
MISC--: what extent do they integrate all information available them
MISC--: there at least two causes superficial treatment available information
OWNX--: first cognitive limitation
CONT--: people do not use optimal approach because proper integration all information available beyond their mental powers
OWNX--: all humans limited cognitive abilities citation this fundamental difficulty exacerbated conditions under traffic court judges work
OWNX--: their workload high only few minutes available case each characterized some twenty parameters
MISC--: strategy selection contingent task demands citation
MISC--: time pressure specifically time available per variable been shown affect decision making citation resulting fewer variables being considered replacement complex cognitive strategies simpler ones citation processing hundreds cases month after month traffic court judges acquire vast experience
MISC--: there therefore reason expect their decisions settle into some pattern
CONT--: however this second factor they do not benefit feedback this important consequences
MISC--: feedback appropriateness one s decisions been shown essential developing good strategies citation
MISC--: particular while interactions often ignored multivariable decisions citation this not case when decision makers habitual access feedback their decisions care greatly about outcome citation
MISC--: even if judges knew what happened offenders they sentenced they lack clear criterion evaluate quality their decision
MISC--: judges little incentive develop complex decision rules
MISC--: yet they surely do not render random judgments
MISC--: instead accuracy they may strive adequate judgment one they consider appropriate circumstances expresses their attitudes about each case
MISC--: yet even if this criterion adequacy replaces accuracy unlikely judges attempt reach best possible decision every case
MISC--: since their task routine each case must quickly dispatched lest backlog increase plausible they do not invest much care judges higher courts where stakes arehigher acquaintance offender protracted
MISC--: they may also use methods less well thought out than if resources were unlimited motivation high information complete
