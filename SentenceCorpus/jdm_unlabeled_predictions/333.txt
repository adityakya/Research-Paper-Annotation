MISC--: recognition heuristic exploits basic psychological capacity recognition order make inferences about unknown quantities world
BASE--: this article we review clarify issues emerged our initial work citation including distinction between recognition evaluation process
MISC--: there now considerable evidence i recognition heuristic predicts inferences substantial proportion individuals consistently even presence one more contradicting cues ii people adaptive decision makers accordance increases larger recognition validity decreases situations when validity low wholly indeterminable iii presence contradicting cues some individuals appear select different strategies
MISC--: little known about individual differences how precisely model alternative strategies
CONT--: although some researchers attributed judgments inconsistent use recognition heuristic compensatory processing little research compensatory models been reported
OWNX--: we discuss extensions recognition model open questions unanticipated results surprising predictive power recognition forecasting
MISC--: herbert simon s citation emphasis recognition memory limited search starting point was only small logical step towards recognition heuristic exploits potential information lack recognition
MISC--: accordance simon s emphasis computational models recognition principle was first called was formulated building block take best other heuristics order model inferences memory citation
MISC--: subsequently was realized this initial building block could function stand alone model same type inferences was named recognition heuristic citation
MISC--: reality recognition heuristic was not derived logical manner
MISC--: serendipity luck finding something one was not looking assisted its birth
MISC--: gigerenzer hoffrage kleinbolting citation had deduced probabilistic mental models theory situation hard easy effect would disappear
OWNX--: his dissertation ulrich hoffrage citation set out test this prediction he needed two sets questions one hard one easy
MISC--: hoffrage chose questions concerning populations american cities german cities respectively hard easy german students so everyone thought
MISC--: surprisingly students scored slightly higher when tested representative sample american cities than german ones
MISC--: result ruined experiment
MISC--: how could people score more correct answers domain they knew less
OWNX--: days our research group failed think cognitive process makes more out less
MISC--: finally anton kuhberger pointed out explanation was tucked away gigerenzer et al citation article mentioned familiarity probabilistic cue
MISC--: if person heard one city but not other this lack recognition informative indicating recognized city probably larger population
MISC--: german cities participants could not rely recognition heuristic they knew too much
MISC--: this serendipitous discovery also revealed crucial condition successful reliance recognition substantial correlation between recognition population recognition validity representative sampling cities
OWNX--: we return this condition later
OWNX--: one possible reason why took us so long find answer was our training classical statistical models
MISC--: weighted linear model adding cue predictor never decrease its fit unadjusted r same true bayes rule citation
CONT--: this more better principle holds fitting parameters known data but not necessarily predicting what one does not already know german students had do
MISC--: good cognitive heuristic however should excel foresight well hindsight
MISC--: possibility people could sometimes do better less knowledge generated much interest controversy social sciences media
MISC--: may number bbc intrigued idea less being more decided test effect their radio number more less program
OWNX--: listeners new york london were asked whether detroit milwaukee larger population
MISC--: exploratory studies his dissertation one us citation had found about number percent american students answered correctly detroit compared number percent corresponding group german participants
MISC--: bbc not known running tightly controlled studies so we were somewhat uneasy about whether they could reproduce less more effect
MISC--: but they did
OWNX--: new york number percent listeners got answer right whereas london number percent did so close one hope informal replication
OWNX--: our initial work recognition heuristic stimulated dozens articles comprising theoretical advancements critique above all progress
MISC--: this work contributed much understanding potential limits this simple model but we also believe its broad reception represents larger shift research practice
OWNX--: this change occurs three directions we begin our review progress made last decade two key processes govern use recognition heuristic recognition evaluation latter corresponds judgment its ecological rationality
