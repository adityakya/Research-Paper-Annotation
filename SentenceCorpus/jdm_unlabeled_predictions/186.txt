MISC--: this study employs discrete choice experiment dce health care sector test loss aversion theory derived reference dependent preferences absolute subjective value deviation reference point generally greater when deviation represents loss than when same sized change perceived gain
AIMX--: far known this paper first use dce test loss aversion theory
MISC--: dce highly suitable tool testing because estimates marginal valuations attributes based deviations reference point constant scenario
MISC--: moreover loss aversion examined each attribute separately
MISC--: another advantage dce applied non traded goods non tangible attributes
MISC--: health care event used empirical illustration loss aversion theory tested within context preference structures maternity ward attributes estimated using data gathered number observations made sample number women who had recently given birth
MISC--: seven hypotheses presented tested
OWNX--: overall significant support behavioral loss aversion theories was found
MISC--: person s valuation benefit outcome choice often determined intrinsic consumption utility outcome itself combined its contrast reference point
MISC--: most noteworthy manifestation reference dependent preferences loss aversion absolute subjective value change endowment generally greater when deviation reference point represents loss than when same sized change perceived gain
MISC--: most systematic general theory this kind probably tversky kahneman s citation reference dependence model builds kahneman tversky s citation prospect theory
MISC--: significance loss aversion highlighted camerer s citation review practical implications prospect theory seven out ten examples derived loss aversion hypothesis
MISC--: recently koszegi rabin citation presented extended model reference dependent preferences loss aversion claimed more generally applicable
MISC--: numerous studies present evidence supporting loss aversion hypothesis
MISC--: they include hartman et al citation hardie et al citation andreoni citation benartzi thaler citation camerer et al citation myagkov plott citation bowman et al citation jullien salanie citation genesove mayer citation
MISC--: there also several studies looking at loss aversion medical domain
MISC--: they include stalmeier bezembinder citation robinson et al citation bleichrodt pinto citation van osh et al citation
OWNX--: what reference point used individual evaluate gains positive deviations versus losses negative deviations
OWNX--: majority empirical studies examined traded goods reference point was endowment commodity under consideration
MISC--: expectations were mentioned other researchers candidates reference point shalev citation used expectations his game theoretic model koszegi rabin citation assumed person s reference point her rational expectations held recent past about outcomes
MISC--: they specified rule endogenous derivation this point within framework equilibrium utility maximizing model
MISC--: van osch et al citation argued goals aspirations influence reference point health domain
MISC--: combining qualitative quantitative data they provided evidence reference point life year certainty equivalent ce gambles explored psychology behind reference point
AIMX--: this empirical study takes new different approach determination reference point testing loss aversion hypothesis
MISC--: discrete choice experiments dces used estimation preference structure multi dimensional consumption good service establishing relative importance different attributes provision good service under discussion vis vis constant reference bundle
MISC--: follows employment dce also facilitates testing loss aversion hypothesis each attribute separately
MISC--: decomposition into attribute specific components adds richness insight not obvious people loss averse regarding all kinds attributes there most probably different degrees loss aversion compared across attributes
MISC--: far known this first published study employs dces test attribute specific loss aversion derived reference dependent preferences
MISC--: empirical illustration presented this paper relates dce was conducted among number women who had recently given birth
MISC--: their preferences five maternity ward attributes number beds hospital room attitude staff toward patient medical staff s professionalism information transfer staff patients travel time residence hospital were estimated loss aversion was tested each attributes separately
OWNX--: main results study were loss aversion hypothesis was confirmed four five hospital attributes investigated
OWNX--: results were less conclusive travel time residence hospital
OWNX--: following section describes dce method employed estimation
MISC--: third section presents econometric model followed hypotheses derived loss aversion theory
OWNX--: preference structures used test outlined hypotheses presented section number
