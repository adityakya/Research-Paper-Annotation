MISC--: aim this article evaluate contribution process tracing data development testing models judgment decision making jdm
OWNX--: we draw our experience editing handbook process tracing methods decision research recently published sjdm series
OWNX--: after brief introduction we first describe classic process tracing methods thinking aloud mouselab eye tracking
OWNX--: then we present series examples how each techniques made important contributions development testing process models jdm
OWNX--: we discuss issue large data volumes resulting process tracing remedies handling those
OWNX--: finally we argue importance formulating process hypotheses opt multi method approach focuses cross validation findings
MISC--: theories judgment decision making jdm classified into two general types formal if models specify relationships between input task context parameters output jdm behavior process models addition seek model explanatory psychological mechanisms underlying input output relationships
MISC--: within formal modelling tradition theories evaluated via analysis their predictions concerning outcome judgments decisions subsequent rigorous experimental tests predictions
MISC--: alternative models evaluated terms testable predictions distinguish them citation
MISC--: process models other hand tested evaluated terms both jdm behavior process tracing methods elicit analyze observations range verbal nonverbal antecedents concomitants judgments decisions
MISC--: imagine you conduct risky decision making experiment you observe choices collect verbal protocols
MISC--: you find choices conform say prospect theory citation but verbal protocol only infrequent uses what you coded evidence prospect theory e g reference point setting coding gains losses probability
MISC--: what would you conclude decision making conforms prospect theory according choices fails do so according verbal protocols
OWNX--: we surmise protocols would seen subordinate supplementary source data this case
MISC--: they would tend dismissed if inconsistent choice output
OWNX--: other words we would hardly likely reject prospect theory basis verbal protocols any other process data
MISC--: process data somehow seem subordinate source evidence
MISC--: models aim at predicting outcomes if models this appropriate but not models aim explain both outcome process process models
MISC--: priority output data based natural sequence testing dependent variables predicting choice data first criterion any model process model if model
MISC--: but beyond this first step there no reason prefer outcome over process
BASE--: rather process models process data should equally important because they richer than input output data provide important evidence explanatory mechanisms citation
MISC--: instructive example work glockner herbold citation who show although prospect theory certainly good if model its process assumptions rejected favor alternative models
AIMX--: this paper we describe methods devised field judgment decision making jdm enable recording traces underlying processes cognitive representations
OWNX--: we will describe methods three dimensions their theoretical contribution their core methodology their key results
