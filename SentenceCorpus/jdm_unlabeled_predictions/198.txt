MISC--: theoretical equivalence exists among various auction mechanisms specifically second price auction spa competitive environment bdm mechanism non competitive environment
MISC--: yet empirical studies suggest behavior mechanisms may diverge
OWNX--: our experimental study examines wtp wta individuals analyzing buying selling bidding patterns both physical product mugs two types lotteries regular lotteries extreme lotteries two auctions mechanism spa bdm
OWNX--: we found wtp spa higher than wtp bdm mugs regular lotteries while mechanisms do not differ significantly extreme lotteries
MISC--: addition wta spa lower than bdm regular lotteries only
OWNX--: results indicate wtp wta well wta wtp gap tend differ spa bdm result interaction between competitiveness effect other psychological effects bidding patterns riskless risky assets
MISC--: addition current study suggests competitiveness effect depends not only type mechanism spa but also type item physical assets lotteries type lottery
MISC--: addition influence competitiveness effect may vary between buying selling positions
MISC--: several studies compared bidding patterns subjects different auction mechanisms
MISC--: despite theoretical equivalence among various auction mechanisms bdm mechanism citation second price auction henceforth spa citation empirical studies suggest behavior mechanisms may diverge citation
MISC--: auctions based bdm mechanism individuals buying asset declare their maximum buying price known willingness pay wtp
MISC--: if bidding price higher than drawn number individual pays drawn number buys asset
MISC--: when selling asset individuals declare their minimum selling price known willingness accept wta
MISC--: if bidding price lower than drawn number individual receives amount drawn number sells asset
MISC--: auctions based spa highest bidder buying auction wins final prize pays second highest bid
MISC--: lowest bidder selling auction wins final prize pays second lowest bid
MISC--: spa more competitive than bdm mechanism since each participant competes others
MISC--: shogren et al citation suggested spa people may submit bids win sake winning
MISC--: they may bid wtp up wta down order walk out experiment top dog among their peers p number
MISC--: top dog effect said exist if bidders submit bids excess their true valuation intention deriving utility winning auction
MISC--: previous evidence existence top dog effect been mixed
MISC--: shogren hayes citation report nearly number percent participants induced value auction market submitted bids were less than equal their assigned value
OWNX--: authors concluded results not consistent existence top dog effect
MISC--: contrast kagel s review citation induced value spa literature indicates mean bid auctions generally greater than predicted theory
MISC--: corrigan rousu citation provided evidence spa overbidding repeated trial auctions interpreting results top dog effect
MISC--: addition shavit et al citation show competitiveness affects bidding patterns spa
MISC--: current study examines impact top dog effect competitiveness effect spa bidding patterns different goods riskless risky assets different positions buyer seller
MISC--: particular study examined wtp wta analyzing buying selling bidding patterns both mugs lotteries two separate auctions mechanism spa competitive environment bdm mechanism non competitive environment
OWNX--: we consider two types lotteries regular lotteries extreme lotteries
OWNX--: extreme lotteries involve very high outcome associated small probability low zero outcome associated high probability
OWNX--: previous studies did not distinguish between biddings regular extreme lotteries two mechanisms
OWNX--: this study we examine two types lotteries since we expected find differences between them bidding patterns spa bdm
OWNX--: extreme lotteries we expect no impact competitiveness effect buying position spa since chances loss very high lottery will not attractive buy
OWNX--: addition we expect competitiveness effect selling position spa will canceled out since seller extreme lottery who focuses very high winning outcome will avoid selling
MISC--: evaluate wtp wta item we considered several psychological effects influence bidding patterns individuals
OWNX--: effects impact each effects sum all them wtp wta expected vary among goods mechanisms
OWNX--: literature does not discuss possible interaction between psychological effects competitiveness environment effect
OWNX--: our study fills this void compares interaction effects bidding mugs lotteries
MISC--: psychological effects loss aversion endowment effect been used explain wta wtp disparity citation
MISC--: yet recent studies questioned existence interpretation possible gap between wtp wta citation
MISC--: shogren hayes citation shogern et al citation argued wta wtp disparity first trial market goods candy bars university mugs both auctions bdm spa disappeared quickly repeated trials spa though persisted bdm mechanism
MISC--: shogern et al citation suggested wta wtp disparity may depend auction mechanism
MISC--: lotteries schmidt traub citation argued asymmetric effect buyer focuses potential disappointment lowest outcome seller focuses potential regret losing highest outcome may cause disparity between wta wtp
AIMX--: current study we use not only mugs but also regular extreme lotteries enable us examine more rigorously this asymmetry between buyers sellers
MISC--: sum current study examines wta wtp riskless goods mugs two types risky assets regular extreme lotteries competitive versus non competitive mechanisms compares wta wtp gap items two mechanisms
MISC--: study also discusses influence interaction between competitive effect other psychological effects subjects bidding patterns
MISC--: results should shed some light impact competitiveness effect spa bidding pattern different assets different positions comparison bdm
AIMX--: rest paper organized follows
OWNX--: section number outlines main hypotheses section number presents experimental method section number presents results
