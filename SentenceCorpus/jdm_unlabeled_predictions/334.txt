MISC--: recognition heuristic assumes people make inferences based output recognition memory
MISC--: while much work been devoted establishing recognition heuristic viable description how people make inferences more work needed fully integrate research recognition heuristic research broader cognitive psychology literature
OWNX--: this article we outline four challenges should met this integration take place close call address four challenges collectively rather than piecemeal
MISC--: goldstein gigerenzer citation proposed recognition heuristic mechanism describe inferential judgments
MISC--: briefly this heuristic asserts inference made merely basis presence absence information memory if one two objects recognized other not then infer recognized object higher value citation
MISC--: elegance recognition heuristic decision rule lies its simplicity not only does purport inferences achieved through simple rule but also appears intuitive process model
MISC--: development recognition heuristic goldstein gigerenzer citation fueled over decade research within behavioral decision making
MISC--: while recognition heuristic been well received many researchers citation others been rather critical its accuracy describing underlying psychological processes citation
MISC--: criticisms notwithstanding recognition heuristic led focus recognition based inference much like other heuristics representativeness managed permanent place within judgment decision making vernacular citation
MISC--: while construct representativeness proved transformational judgment decision making research arguably run its course useful theoretical construct citation
MISC--: question however whether recognition heuristic will follow similar path
OWNX--: this article we present four closely related challenges researchers investigating recognition heuristic well call fundamental shift research strategy
OWNX--: we argue challenges should met our call strategy shift taken up if theoretical progress research recognition heuristic move forward
MISC--: before going into detail few comments warranted
OWNX--: first our four challenges our call research strategy shift not intended criticisms but rather proposals future research directions
AIMX--: second while we frame challenges our call strategy shift respect recognition heuristic they may apply related models inference including classics availability heuristic
CONT--: importantly likely meeting challenges will require extending revising recognition heuristic whether this heuristic will then still named recognition heuristic immaterial our points because hintzman citation observed explanatory burden carried proposed mechanism not what they called p number
OWNX--: finally some our challenges intended consider full import memory processes judgment decision making
MISC--: literature memory theory provides fertile ground enriching extending theories judgment decision making
MISC--: while recent work decision theory emphasized adaptive role recognition may play facilitating accurate judgment errors biases commonplace amongst memory phenomena including effects false memories citation misinformation citation imagination inflation citation reality source monitoring errors citation amongst many others citation
MISC--: inasmuch memory processes exploited purposes judgment decision making then understanding full range effects associated common usage memory seems relevant understanding judgment decision making
MISC--: similar vein inasmuch there multiple strategies may deployed guiding judgment decision making assumed framework recognition heuristic been developed there need developing cognitive architectures both accommodate multiple strategies model how people select amongst them
MISC--: example not sufficient postulate some choices made relying recognition memory one must model precisely possible how decision maker come utilize recognition opposed some other process
